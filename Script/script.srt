1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:12,375
What I would like to do with Moselantja

2
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:20,666
is for us to live in peace

3
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:36,666
Peace means peaceful life within the family

4
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:46,750
Let us be people who live well in peace

5
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,416
My name is Matsele Selikane

6
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:55,416
I live at Ha Masupeli with my two grandchildren

7
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:59,416
Thabiso and Moselantja

8
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:02,833
Libraries are also traditionally a place of community

9
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,750
I also believe that we can

10
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,541
build community with a digital library

11
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:08,916
Thats one of the reasons

12
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,875
that we started working at schools

13
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,458
I anticipate that Solar Spell would reach

14
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,41
to all these populations in across Africa

15
00:01:16,41 --> 00:01:18,541
Solar Spell Health Solar Spell education

16
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,750
Im anticipating having all the Solar Spell

17
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,500
libraries across Africa in remote areas particularly

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,375
The moment you come to

19
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:28,500
the demonstration on the Solar Spell

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,916
and how it works

21
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,666
and how you can access the books

22
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,958
you can even see the faces

23
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:38,83
and the smiles you see on the people

24
00:01:38,83 --> 00:01:43,83
Its because they know that this

25
00:01:43,83 --> 00:01:46,541
is what we have been waiting for

26
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,375
To them they know

27
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:52,375
this is what we have been waiting for

28
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,333
we want to have it
