What I would like to do with Moselantja 
is for us to live in peace. 
Peace means peaceful life within the family. 


Let us be people who live well in peace.


My name is Matsele Selikane. 
I live at Ha Masupeli with my two grandchildren, 
Thabiso and Moselantja.

Libraries are also traditionally a place of community.
I also believe that we can 
build community with a digital library. 
That's one of the reasons 
that we started working at schools.

I anticipate that Solar Spell would reach 
to all these populations in across Africa. 
Solar Spell Health, Solar Spell education, 
I'm anticipating having all the Solar Spell 
libraries across Africa in remote areas, particularly.


The moment you come to 
the demonstration on the Solar Spell 
and how it works,
and how you can access the books, 
you can even see the faces 
and the smiles you see on the people. 
Itâ€™s because they know that this 
is what we have been waiting for. 
To them, they know 
this is what we have been waiting for, 
we want to have it.
