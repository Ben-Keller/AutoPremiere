1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Where are you from Neko?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I am from a territory called Akualü

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Although the elders call it Manaure

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Ah, you came from the wild west and now you're here

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In Nazareth or township of Nazareth as they call it

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We are in the territory of Usijou´, in Alewalü.
I don't know if you've heard that it's a sacred place.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes, it is the only one with some characteristics
different natural

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes of course. My grandmother and my mother's grandmother were from here.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Where is the sea? If over there, from here you can see the sea

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes it's true.
Yes, they lived here

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But is the sea far from here? Yes, it's far away.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
They said they moved, they had left their
things as you can see

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
There where the pieces of amuchi (ceramics) are,
are their ancestral remains (bone)

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
They decided to go to the seashore because
They say they were already bored here

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Then they left, but they came back again. Yeah. right here

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This was what you were talking about, right? Yeah.
I can touch it? No. It is prohibited

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You can't touch it, you can only see it. If you touch it
you can get sick

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
When you touch it you take away the energies of the dead
that can cause you some harm

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Same with your arrival here

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
TRUE. You had to harmonize with the territory because we
surround the souls of those who lived here

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This belonged to them right? Yes, that's why their souls
They are here because those are their belongings.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This was their territory and they said that no one can
take part of this sand

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Then we, the Pausayu, arrived to inhabit it.

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I understand. And what did they bring from the sea?

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The sand, they threw it here so that it would stay like this

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That is, they brought the sand from the beach in
this desert piece

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The old people say that through a dream they were told
to bring the sand from there

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm telling you so you can say it, this part
then they cut it

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Guille said that in the dream they were told
the next

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That, if they loved this land so much, they could bring the
earth up to here

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and that's what they did. This is how this place originated

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You could say that. That started from a dream
and so on

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So they brought him here, right? Yeah.
They brought it little by little until it spread

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:58,000
As you can see this before this was small, but after
They expanded it up to there

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yes, now I understand. How nice to know the history
behind this

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes of course, in fact, all this that is here
It's also beautiful

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah. It is very good to make known what
we have because it is part of our Wayuu culture

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You will already know that this place exists in La Guajira, Alewalü
will be recognized by the world

39
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Through stories like these you will learn not only
the place but its spirituality

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Since there are also many jewels of
the deceased

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That is why it is a sacred place because here are the
things from those who created it

42
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
People say that here in the north is where
are the most sacred places

43
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And that is why it is important to make them known. Yes of course.

44
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Well, thank you very much for what you shared with us.
Anyway, thanks to you for coming,

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
For coming from so far to know our territory

46
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
After winter it doesn't bloom here? No,
Does it stay like this? Yes of course, it gets wet and that's it

47
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The animals walk and do not get their paws wet.
You see there is no grass. No.

48
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And if it rains a lot? It may rain a lot but still
It does not bloom because it is a sacred place

49
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The territory is sacred

50
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That was destined. Yes, that's why they were created
ancestors who saw here

51
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
People who come to Nazareth say that their
ancestors are from here too

52
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Those from Dusakawi (health association) said that their
grandmothers told them that they have ancestors here

53
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They say they will come back here again.
Yes, that's OK

54
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I think it's good that they come again so that
learn more, we make you climb the mountains

55
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes, we have to arrive earlier, look, they are already rushing us. Yes, it's true, it is complex.

56
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Because it is already getting dark and we already have
we have to leave because of how sacred it is

57
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You are in Alewalü in the Alewalü Dunes

58
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Smile smile. Stretch your hands. That

59
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That, that raise your hands, aha say hello, say hello.

60
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Alewalu
