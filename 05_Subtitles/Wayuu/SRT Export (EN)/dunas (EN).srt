1
00:00 --> 00:02
Where are you from Neko?

2
00:03 --> 00:06
I am from a territory called Akualü

3
00:07 --> 00:10
Although the elders call it Manaure

4
00:11 --> 00:16
Ah, you came from the wild west and now you're here

5
00:18 --> 00:21
In Nazareth or township of Nazareth as they call it

6
00:22 --> 00:30
We are in the territory of Usijou´, in Alewalü.
I don't know if you've heard that it's a sacred place.

7
00:31 --> 00:36
Yes, it is the only one with some characteristics
different natural

8
00:39 --> 00:45
Yes of course. My grandmother and my mother's grandmother were from here.

9
00:47 --> 00:51
Where is the sea? If over there, from here you can see the sea

10
00:52 --> 00:56
Yes it's true.
Yes, they lived here

11
00:57 --> 01:01
But is the sea far from here? Yes, it's far away.

12
01:02 --> 01:09
They said they moved, they had left their
things as you can see

13
01:10 --> 01:18
There where the pieces of amuchi (ceramics) are,
are their ancestral remains (bone)

14
01:19 --> 01:27
They decided to go to the seashore because
They say they were already bored here

15
01:28 --> 01:33
Then they left, but they came back again. Yeah. right here

16
01:35 --> 01:42
This was what you were talking about, right? Yeah.
I can touch it? No. It is prohibited

17
01:43 --> 01:49
You can't touch it, you can only see it. If you touch it
you can get sick

18
01:51 --> 01:50
When you touch it you take away the energies of the dead
that can cause you some harm

19
02:00 --> 02:02
Same with your arrival here

20
02:03 --> 02:09
TRUE. You had to harmonize with the territory because we
surround the souls of those who lived here

21
02:10 --> 02:18
This belonged to them right? Yes, that's why their souls
They are here because those are their belongings.

22
02:21 --> 02:28
This was their territory and they said that no one can
take part of this sand

23
02:29 --> 02:36
Then we, the Pausayu, arrived to inhabit it.

24
02:37 --> 02:40
I understand. And what did they bring from the sea?

25
02:41 --> 02:46
The sand, they threw it here so that it would stay like this

26
02:47 --> 02:53
That is, they brought the sand from the beach in
this desert piece

27
02:56 --> 03:03
The old people say that through a dream they were told
to bring the sand from there

28
03:04 --> 03:07
I'm telling you so you can say it, this part
then they cut it

29
03:08 --> 03:12
Guille said that in the dream they were told
the next

30
03:13 --> 03:18
That, if they loved this land so much, they could bring the
earth up to here

31
03:19 --> 03:26
and that's what they did. This is how this place originated

32
03:27 --> 03:34
You could say that. That started from a dream
and so on

33
03:39 --> 03:48
So they brought him here, right? Yeah.
They brought it little by little until it spread

34
03:49 --> 03:58
As you can see this before this was small, but after
They expanded it up to there

35
03:59 --> 04:05
Yes, now I understand. How nice to know the history
behind this

36
04:06 --> 04:10
Yes of course, in fact, all this that is here
It's also beautiful

37
04:13 --> 04:21
Yeah. It is very good to make known what
we have because it is part of our Wayuu culture

38
04:22 --> 04:29
You will already know that this place exists in La Guajira, Alewalü
will be recognized by the world

39
04:30 --> 04:37
Through stories like these you will learn not only
the place but its spirituality

40
04:38 --> 04:45
Since there are also many jewels of
the deceased

41
04:46 --> 04:52
That is why it is a sacred place because here are the
things from those who created it

42
04:55 --> 05:03
People say that here in the north is where
are the most sacred places

43
05:04 --> 05:07
And that is why it is important to make them known. Yes of course.

44
05:08 --> 05:15
Well, thank you very much for what you shared with us.
Anyway, thanks to you for coming,

45
05:16 --> 05:20
For coming from so far to know our territory

46
05:22 --> 05:29
After winter it doesn't bloom here? No,
Does it stay like this? Yes of course, it gets wet and that's it

47
05:30 --> 05:38
The animals walk and do not get their paws wet.
You see there is no grass. No.

48
05:39 --> 05:45
And if it rains a lot? It may rain a lot but still
It does not bloom because it is a sacred place

49
05:46 --> 05:47
The territory is sacred

50
05:48 --> 05:55
That was destined. Yes, that's why they were created
ancestors who saw here

51
05:56 --> 06:02
People who come to Nazareth say that their
ancestors are from here too

52
06:03 --> 06:11
Those from Dusakawi (health association) said that their
grandmothers told them that they have ancestors here

53
06:14 --> 06:22
They say they will come back here again.
Yes, that's OK

54
06:23 --> 06:31
I think it's good that they come again so that
learn more, we make you climb the mountains

55
06:32 --> 06:39
Yes, we have to arrive earlier, look, they are already rushing us. Yes, it's true, it is complex.

56
06:40 --> 06:47
Because it is already getting dark and we already have
we have to leave because of how sacred it is

57
06:48 --> 06:50
You are in Alewalü in the Alewalü Dunes

58
06:51 --> 06:54
Smile smile. Stretch your hands. That

59
06:57 --> 07:01
That, that raise your hands, aha say hello, say hello.

60
07:02 --> 07:03
Alewalu
