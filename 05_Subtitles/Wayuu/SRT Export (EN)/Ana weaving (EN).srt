1
00:00:00:24 --> 00:00:01:23
Well.

2
00:00:02:21 --> 00:00:04:23
Can you explain to me what the project is that you're setting up here?

3
00:00:04:24 --> 00:00:08:07
That you're setting up here?

4
00:00:09:04 --> 00:00:11:19
Well, we have a project.

5
00:00:11:20 --> 00:00:13:27
We have a store.

6
00:00:13:29 --> 00:00:16:08
They call it xxx.

7
00:00:17:23 --> 00:00:20:15
xxx is...

8
00:00:20:22 --> 00:00:21:03
Well.

9
00:00:21:03 --> 00:00:23:18
This project is called "Threads for xxx" (Má).

10
00:00:25:14 --> 00:00:28:01
And this project

11
00:00:29:09 --> 00:00:34:23
involves fabrics, backpacks, various kinds of backpacks.

12
00:00:36:05 --> 00:00:40:23
And well, where we are right now,

13
00:00:40:24 --> 00:00:43:29
this is where the people live

14
00:00:44:00 --> 00:00:46:22
that we partner with to do

15
00:00:47:27 --> 00:00:50:21
this project

16
00:00:51:22 --> 00:00:54:11
which is about, which is about the backpack,

17
00:00:55:02 --> 00:00:57:04
we do an exchange

18
00:01:00:11 --> 00:01:04:24
of recycling and all that it involves.

19
00:01:05:22 --> 00:01:08:24
And well,

20
00:01:08:25 --> 00:01:12:17
we do this for the good of our community,

21
00:01:13:08 --> 00:01:16:22
a cleanup.

22
00:01:18:00 --> 00:01:20:22
And that's why it says "Threads for xxx."

23
00:01:22:09 --> 00:01:24:22
It's for the good of

24
00:01:24:23 --> 00:01:30:05
our community, our land.
And here, you can see a lot of

25
00:01:31:13 --> 00:01:32:17
this,

26
00:01:33:20 --> 00:01:36:10
the pollution that

27
00:01:37:12 --> 00:01:40:05
is very common in La Guajira,

28
00:01:40:06 --> 00:01:43:03
and that's why we are working on

29
00:01:43:04 --> 00:01:46:04
that, on this project,

30
00:01:46:05 --> 00:01:48:13
and well, we are happy.

31
00:01:49:24 --> 00:01:52:08
What is pollution, what kind of pollution?

32
00:01:53:06 --> 00:01:56:04
Well, when we talk about pollution,

33
00:01:56:07 --> 00:02:00:18
it's related to garbage,

34
00:02:01:07 --> 00:02:06:03
with papers, everything related to consumerism,

35
00:02:07:15 --> 00:02:08:19
and that

36
00:02:09:06 --> 00:02:13:16
and well, we're trying to collect all of that and

37
00:02:14:17 --> 00:02:18:22
to do an exchange, as I was saying, as I mentioned earlier.

38
00:02:19:11 --> 00:02:21:13
What is the thread made of?

39
00:02:23:00 --> 00:02:24:06
The thread...

40
00:02:24:21 --> 00:02:27:22
The thread...

41
00:02:29:11 --> 00:02:32:17
Like, I mean, what is it? How did it come about?

42
00:02:33:11 --> 00:02:39:01
Yes, the thread. I mean, are you using plastic to create the thread?

43
00:02:39:02 --> 00:02:43:05
And that's like cleaning it up, helping in that aspect?

44
00:02:44:08 --> 00:02:47:06
Yes, helping like...

45
00:02:47:28 --> 00:02:49:15
As you were saying, it helps our community,

46
00:02:49:16 --> 00:02:50:25
As you mentioned,

47
00:02:52:05 --> 00:02:55:16
it helps our community in a way,

48
00:02:55:18 --> 00:02:58:29
because we, the Wayuu people,

49
00:03:00:06 --> 00:03:03:18
it's like, let's say,

50
00:03:06:11 --> 00:03:08:18
well, since here in the ranchería

51
00:03:08:19 --> 00:03:11:26
is already full of garbage and all that,

52
00:03:12:23 --> 00:03:16:04
so, to improve a bit of this, a bit of that,

53
00:03:16:15 --> 00:03:18:24
that's why this project was born.

54
00:03:20:10 --> 00:03:22:18
and precisely to help our family

55
00:03:23:10 --> 00:03:26:19
and all our relatives.

56
00:03:26:20 --> 00:03:29:19
That's why this project is here.

57
00:04:52:24 --> 00:04:55:06
Yes, so, tell me about your work here.

58
00:04:55:07 --> 00:04:57:29
What do you do with the jewelry?

59
00:04:58:00 --> 00:05:00:22
How do you manage them? Or

60
00:05:00:23 --> 00:05:02:29
What threads do you use? What fabrics?

61
00:05:03:00 --> 00:05:07:09
Well, on our side, my mom and I,

62
00:05:07:24 --> 00:05:10:15
we always use wool.

63
00:05:11:00 --> 00:05:13:01
The question is not... here we use wool.

64
00:05:13:23 --> 00:05:14:26
We make things like this,

65
00:05:16:13 --> 00:05:19:09
like plastic that is collected,

66
00:05:19:10 --> 00:05:21:23
they are taken to the cleaning stations in Manaure,

67
00:05:22:17 --> 00:05:26:17
and as for cardboard and other reusable materials,

68
00:05:27:00 --> 00:05:29:27
the recycling center, they give some coins for it,

69
00:05:29:28 --> 00:05:32:29
so they work on it,

70
00:05:33:00 --> 00:05:35:10
but we don't dye with plastic or anything like that.

71
00:05:40:27 --> 00:05:41:28
And what designs?

72
00:05:41:28 --> 00:05:45:25
What things do you make here or what kind of backpacks?

73
00:05:47:08 --> 00:05:51:01
Yes, backpacks, and also chinchorros.

74
00:05:52:01 --> 00:05:55:00
And

75
00:05:55:17 --> 00:05:58:23
the backpacks, they have a

76
00:05:58:24 --> 00:06:01:10
color, some of them have

77
00:06:01:27 --> 00:06:05:11
what they call "beds," which have various colors,

78
00:06:05:12 --> 00:06:07:29
my mom is showing them.

79
00:06:09:11 --> 00:06:10:19
It's very beautiful.

80
00:06:16:22 --> 00:06:18:25
These are the backpacks,

81
00:06:20:08 --> 00:06:23:09
and well, as for the question, how is my work here?

82
00:06:23:18 --> 00:06:25:28
Yes, so what do you do?

83
00:06:25:29 --> 00:06:28:04
What are the symbols?

84
00:06:29:24 --> 00:06:33:15
The symbols,

85
00:06:34:03 --> 00:06:36:14
Here, there are various types of weaving.

86
00:06:58:16 --> 00:07:01:11
And well, as my brother said,

87
00:07:02:27 --> 00:07:06:00
That's why my work is related to this.

88
00:07:06:04 --> 00:07:11:13
That's why I don't know much...
And he is the one in charge of everything when he goes to the town.

89
00:07:12:20 --> 00:07:15:20
that's it, well, and my duty here

90
00:07:15:21 --> 00:07:18:29
is to take care of the people,

91
00:07:19:27 --> 00:07:22:13
how many backpacks we deliver,

92
00:07:22:14 --> 00:07:26:08
this,

93
00:07:26:09 --> 00:07:27:22
And well,

94
00:07:28:08 --> 00:07:30:29
and as I was saying, there are various kinds of backpacks,

95
00:07:32:26 --> 00:07:36:02
many times in xxx, there's one they call,

96
00:07:37:17 --> 00:07:40:23
well, the ones with multiple colors are the basket-like ones.

97
00:07:40:24 --> 00:07:44:13
And there's one that's called xxx here,

98
00:07:57:28 --> 00:08:02:04
there's a type of weaving called xxx,

99
00:08:03:08 --> 00:08:04:25
in xxx,

100
00:08:06:20 --> 00:08:11:02
it's not this one, it's very, very different from this.

101
00:08:11:03 --> 00:08:14:26
And how did you learn to weave?

102
00:08:14:27 --> 00:08:16:28
Weaving, like

103
00:08:16:29 --> 00:08:20:02
what weaving has to do with our ancestors,

104
00:08:20:24 --> 00:08:24:11
you learn from a young age because here, everyone knows how to weave.

105
00:08:24:22 --> 00:08:29:25
We are all taught, as we are Wayuu, and it's one of the things

106
00:08:29:26 --> 00:08:34:04
one of the most important things in our culture
and that's why, as Wayuu,

107
00:08:34:21 --> 00:08:37:08
we have to know that.

108
00:08:37:12 --> 00:08:41:03
That's why I learned to weave since I was a child.

109
00:08:42:05 --> 00:08:43:09
Watching your mom?

110
00:08:43:10 --> 00:08:45:26
My mom and my grandmother

111
00:08:46:28 --> 00:08:48:29
and all the other relatives

112
00:08:50:23 --> 00:08:51:17
and so on.

113
00:08:51:18 --> 00:08:55:04
And what importance does weaving have in the culture?

114
00:08:57:17 --> 00:09:01:04
It is very important because

115
00:09:01:07 --> 00:09:05:25
there's a narration that my grandmother used to tell,

116
00:09:07:11 --> 00:09:10:15
that in the past, before,

117
00:09:12:22 --> 00:09:14:25
one day,

118
00:09:15:03 --> 00:09:16:04
there was a girl,

119
00:09:17:07 --> 00:09:19:05
about how weaving was born,

120
00:09:19:06 --> 00:09:22:17
that's what I'm going to talk about now, how it was born,

121
00:09:23:00 --> 00:09:25:06
there was a girl,

122
00:09:26:06 --> 00:09:28:26
her name was xxx,

123
00:09:30:14 --> 00:09:34:23
And well,

124
00:09:34:24 --> 00:09:39:06
that girl was,

125
00:09:39:07 --> 00:09:42:11
she was like she was lost, she had no family,

126
00:09:44:00 --> 00:09:46:19
And one day, a boy

127
00:09:46:20 --> 00:09:51:08
came out, he was shepherding

128
00:09:52:18 --> 00:09:54:23
and he found that girl.

129
00:09:56:05 --> 00:09:59:24
And he asked her where she came from,
but the girl didn't speak,

130
00:10:00:09 --> 00:10:02:04
and she was young.

131
00:10:03:27 --> 00:10:06:17
And well, he took her to his house,

132
00:10:06:18 --> 00:10:09:20
he took her there, but they didn't know who her family was,

133
00:10:10:24 --> 00:10:13:16
and then,

134
00:10:13:27 --> 00:10:18:15
time passed, and the girl stayed
in the boy's house with his family.

135
00:10:19:19 --> 00:10:22:24
She had been there, and at night,

136
00:10:24:22 --> 00:10:28:09
at night, she would make chimchorros, but no one knew about it,

137
00:10:28:10 --> 00:10:30:06
that was a secret,

138
00:10:30:15 --> 00:10:34:01
and she would make chimchorros

139
00:10:35:07 --> 00:10:35:22
and also

140
00:10:35:23 --> 00:10:39:08
she also made backpacks, but on her own, just by herself

141
00:10:39:18 --> 00:10:42:03
And no one could know about it

142
00:10:42:04 --> 00:10:44:06
And people were surprised

143
00:10:46:02 --> 00:10:46:24
in the morning

144
00:10:46:24 --> 00:10:49:01
They saw that, and where did that come from?

145
00:10:49:02 --> 00:10:52:00
And since she didn't speak, she just kept looking,

146
00:10:53:02 --> 00:10:55:17
and that went on, time passed,

147
00:10:55:27 --> 00:10:58:18
and she made many things,

148
00:10:58:19 --> 00:11:01:25
the hammocks,

149
00:11:02:03 --> 00:11:04:26
and then, until one day,

150
00:11:04:27 --> 00:11:06:18
the boy,

151
00:11:07:08 --> 00:11:10:17
the girl had grown up,

152
00:11:10:18 --> 00:11:14:18
she had become a young lady right there, and they locked her up

153
00:11:15:01 --> 00:11:16:10
And she still did that

154
00:11:19:06 --> 00:11:22:26
And well, until one day, the boy

155
00:11:24:13 --> 00:11:28:01
who didn't mean to, entered the house

156
00:11:28:20 --> 00:11:31:17
and found her doing that, and no one could see her,

157
00:11:33:00 --> 00:11:35:12
And well, she disappeared.

158
00:11:35:13 --> 00:11:37:29
Because she's not a normal girl, so to speak,

159
00:11:40:07 --> 00:11:41:19
and that's how it was born,

160
00:11:41:19 --> 00:11:44:29
that's how it remained for us,

161
00:11:46:14 --> 00:11:47:26
the Wayuu people,

162
00:11:48:10 --> 00:11:50:27
and it's one of the things, one of the customs,

163
00:11:52:01 --> 00:11:54:00
most important

164
00:11:54:20 --> 00:11:56:25
in our culture.

165
00:11:58:24 --> 00:12:03:02
And does it have something to do with the spiderweb they also weave?

166
00:12:03:07 --> 00:12:06:09
Oh yes, the spiderweb

167
00:12:06:10 --> 00:12:08:21
also, because spiderweb

168
00:12:09:29 --> 00:12:12:10
in Spanish is "telaraña," in Wayuu it's "xxx"

169
00:12:14:21 --> 00:12:17:21
It's the same in words, in Wayuu it's "xxx"

170
00:12:19:01 --> 00:12:20:04
and that.

171
00:12:20:05 --> 00:12:22:09
And do you learn from them too?

172
00:12:22:10 --> 00:12:24:17
Yes, of course.

173
00:12:24:18 --> 00:12:29:02
That's why today you can see what weaving is,
thanks to her.

174
00:12:29:26 --> 00:12:37:14
to the spiderweb.

175
00:12:48:14 --> 00:12:50:24
How many hours a day to create one?

176
00:12:50:25 --> 00:12:52:10
One backpack,

177
00:12:53:07 --> 00:12:57:04
The smallest one,

178
00:12:57:25 --> 00:13:01:07
My grandmother is very fast because I am a bit slow,

179
00:13:01:08 --> 00:13:05:01
sometimes it takes me two days for one backpack,

180
00:13:05:11 --> 00:13:11:02
My grandmother sometimes makes two backpacks a day.

181
00:13:11:03 --> 00:13:15:25
Well,
the big ones like that last a day, the small ones

182
00:13:17:05 --> 00:13:18:10
you make two

183
00:13:18:10 --> 00:13:22:04
backpacks a day, as I was saying,

184
00:13:22:05 --> 00:13:25:13
And well, here I also have a little nephew

185
00:13:25:14 --> 00:13:28:21
who also makes the xxx

186
00:13:28:22 --> 00:13:30:15
What is it?

187
00:13:30:16 --> 00:13:32:07
The handle of the backpack

188
00:13:34:13 --> 00:13:36:16
He also knows how to make it, that one.

189
00:13:38:13 --> 00:13:40:16
And does he do it there?

190
00:13:41:18 --> 00:13:47:25
Yes, and that's in progress.

191
00:13:59:09 --> 00:14:04:29
And the designs, where
do you get inspiration for the designs?

192
00:14:05:11 --> 00:14:10:27
Inspiration has to do with nature,

193
00:14:14:18 --> 00:14:16:18
For example,

194
00:14:17:06 --> 00:14:19:28
like the clouds,

195
00:14:22:10 --> 00:14:25:02
like the water, which is blue,

196
00:14:25:16 --> 00:14:28:03
That's why many are inspired by that,

197
00:14:29:15 --> 00:14:33:12
and the red color of blood.

198
00:14:34:14 --> 00:14:37:04
Can you tell me the name of,

199
00:14:38:21 --> 00:14:42:00
the meaning, the significance
of the name

200
00:14:42:07 --> 00:14:45:25
of the store and the project and all that?

201
00:14:45:26 --> 00:14:47:15
Xxx, aha, xxx,

202
00:14:48:17 --> 00:14:49:28
What does it mean?

203
00:14:49:28 --> 00:14:51:24
And what does it have to do with?

204
00:14:52:12 --> 00:14:54:26
Well, xxx

205
00:14:54:27 --> 00:14:56:15
means

206
00:14:57:19 --> 00:15:01:29
Well, xxx

207
00:15:02:04 --> 00:15:04:07
What does that word mean?

208
00:15:04:08 --> 00:15:06:01
Well,

209
00:15:06:01 --> 00:15:07:29
that has to do with

210
00:15:08:23 --> 00:15:11:27
with the red color,

211
00:15:11:28 --> 00:15:18:05
which is the color of blood, that identifies us

212
00:15:18:24 --> 00:15:22:10
many times, especially in our culture,

213
00:15:23:10 --> 00:15:25:24
that blood is important,

214
00:15:26:19 --> 00:15:30:07
and that's why we put it there,
it represents the red color

215
00:15:30:25 --> 00:15:33:09
xxx. Yes.

216
00:15:54:05 --> 00:15:58:19
Can you once again
talk a little more about the inspiration

217
00:15:58:20 --> 00:16:01:03
from nature in the textiles,

218
00:16:01:27 --> 00:16:04:02
how does it come out?

219
00:16:04:11 --> 00:16:07:04
How is that?

220
00:16:07:05 --> 00:16:09:23
In the textiles?

221
00:16:10:07 --> 00:16:13:22
Well, when it comes to
nature, as I was saying,

222
00:16:16:07 --> 00:16:17:20
the water,

223
00:16:19:04 --> 00:16:23:00
also these,

224
00:16:24:24 --> 00:16:29:01
the cardones, also

225
00:16:34:11 --> 00:16:39:10
there are many types of plants
that sometimes one

226
00:16:40:13 --> 00:16:42:19
also

227
00:16:43:20 --> 00:16:45:03
the clouds,

228
00:16:46:02 --> 00:16:48:18
that is also one of the inspirations, and that's why

229
00:16:48:19 --> 00:16:51:02
we also incorporate it into the weaving

230
00:16:52:24 --> 00:16:53:24
in this,

231
00:16:53:25 --> 00:16:56:28
does this backpack
have inspirations from symbols

232
00:16:56:29 --> 00:16:58:28
that have some meaning?

233
00:17:03:23 --> 00:17:08:02
Trash bins.

234
00:18:31:16 --> 00:18:34:18
And the learning of it,

235
00:18:35:10 --> 00:18:39:22
at what age do they start weaving

236
00:18:39:23 --> 00:18:40:13
in each

237
00:18:41:12 --> 00:18:43:09
community, in each family too?

238
00:18:43:10 --> 00:18:44:16
At what age?

239
00:18:47:09 --> 00:18:49:17
At seven or eight years old,

240
00:18:50:14 --> 00:18:51:02
they

241
00:18:53:11 --> 00:18:54:13
are taught,

242
00:18:54:28 --> 00:18:57:16
but girls also, sometimes,

243
00:18:58:28 --> 00:19:01:20
if they want to learn, they start at five years old.

244
00:19:03:00 --> 00:19:05:28
they start like that, and boys too,

245
00:19:07:05 --> 00:19:09:18
even boys know how to weave.

246
00:19:09:19 --> 00:19:12:22
Not just women? No

247
00:19:12:23 --> 00:19:17:21
Yes, even boys and also older people, even men.

248
00:19:18:21 --> 00:19:22:18
Most of them, everyone knows how to weave.

249
00:19:22:29 --> 00:19:25:21
And is it something traditional, traditional here? Yes

250
00:19:28:04 --> 00:19:30:02
Yes,

251
00:19:30:03 --> 00:19:32:17
because here the backpacks

252
00:19:33:23 --> 00:19:35:29
here,

253
00:19:36:10 --> 00:19:40:05
we have a great need,

254
00:19:40:06 --> 00:19:43:08
craftsmanship related to weaving

255
00:19:44:21 --> 00:19:47:20
is what, as I told you,

256
00:19:47:21 --> 00:19:49:06
it's what

257
00:19:53:07 --> 00:19:56:07
because sometimes we make backpacks, right,

258
00:19:56:08 --> 00:20:00:10
We take around 20, 25 of them to the town

259
00:20:01:16 --> 00:20:03:25
and we sell them

260
00:20:04:11 --> 00:20:06:14
and buy more thread and

261
00:20:07:02 --> 00:20:09:27
We also buy things for consumption.

262
00:20:09:28 --> 00:20:13:28
That's why it's very important,
because we depend on that,

263
00:20:14:16 --> 00:20:17:00
since there is no work here.

264
00:20:17:01 --> 00:20:24:09
That's why we depend on the trade
of backpacks, hammocks, and all handicrafts.

265
00:20:25:14 --> 00:20:27:06
That's why it's very important,

266
00:20:27:07 --> 00:20:30:06
that's why men also start to

267
00:20:32:06 --> 00:20:33:21
make backpacks.

268
00:20:35:23 --> 00:20:39:13
Do you feel connected to your roots

269
00:20:39:14 --> 00:20:45:00
when you do this? Do you feel
connected to your roots while weaving?

270
00:20:45:11 --> 00:20:49:16
Yes, yes, we are happy,

271
00:20:50:00 --> 00:20:53:03
and beyond, outside of

272
00:20:54:12 --> 00:20:57:02
Colombia, they recognize us more because of this

273
00:20:57:18 --> 00:20:59:25
and that's why we are very proud to be Wayuu

274
00:21:00:22 --> 00:21:03:00
and we will never stop weaving.

275
00:21:03:16 --> 00:21:06:25
We will always weave for the new generation.

276
00:21:07:28 --> 00:21:09:09
Always,

277
00:21:10:09 --> 00:21:12:16
our tradition will always continue.

278
00:21:13:04 --> 00:21:14:06
And that's it.

279
00:21:14:07 --> 00:21:17:06
Are these backpacks famous throughout Colombia?

280
00:21:17:19 --> 00:21:21:21
Yes, outside of Colombia, they are known all over the world.

281
00:21:22:16 --> 00:21:26:09
And is this the emblematic one of the Wayuu, this one?

282
00:21:27:19 --> 00:21:29:26
Well, yes, this one represents the Wayuu,

283
00:21:31:17 --> 00:21:33:15
what the weaving is.

284
00:21:35:19 --> 00:21:38:10
Yes, I've seen it all over the world.

285
00:21:38:18 --> 00:21:42:26
Also, all over Colombia.

286
00:22:47:24 --> 00:22:51:23
Also, another question. Can you explain to me what "Xxx" is?

287
00:22:52:27 --> 00:22:55:11
Xxx?

288
00:22:55:12 --> 00:22:56:06
Earth,

289
00:22:56:07 --> 00:22:59:16
Sand, "Xxx."

290
00:22:59:17 --> 00:23:01:20
It's earth, "Xxx": land.

291
00:23:02:23 --> 00:23:06:02
And what does it mean to you?

292
00:23:07:05 --> 00:23:08:04
"Threads for Xxx."

293
00:23:08:05 --> 00:23:12:02
It's thread for our land,

294
00:23:12:03 --> 00:23:14:20
and our land is

295
00:23:14:21 --> 00:23:15:16
what is here.

296
00:23:15:16 --> 00:23:18:14
That's why, because of our land,
we are working.

297
00:23:19:19 --> 00:23:21:19
That means for our land.

298
00:23:21:20 --> 00:23:24:26
For our land,
this project was born.

299
00:23:26:15 --> 00:23:29:13
For how to take better care of it,

300
00:23:30:04 --> 00:23:33:12
for the environment,

301
00:23:33:13 --> 00:23:35:28
taking care of our surroundings.

302
00:23:39:20 --> 00:23:41:01
And that's it.

303
00:23:41:04 --> 00:23:42:12
Nothing more.

304
00:24:05:27 --> 00:24:08:13
Is it related, like all of this art,

305
00:24:08:14 --> 00:24:11:26
and craftsmanship,

306
00:24:11:27 --> 00:24:14:13
and the threads for xxx?

307
00:24:15:02 --> 00:24:16:03
Threads

308
00:24:17:05 --> 00:24:19:15
For xxx,

309
00:24:19:16 --> 00:24:22:23
it's the thread related to craftsmanship.

310
00:24:23:20 --> 00:24:25:16
And that's why

311
00:24:25:28 --> 00:24:27:13
the weaving,

312
00:24:28:07 --> 00:24:30:27
and that's why, as the thread forms.

313
00:24:31:26 --> 00:24:34:20
And it has to do with craftsmanship,

314
00:24:36:07 --> 00:24:39:06
and that's why everything is very important.

315
00:25:50:23 --> 00:25:54:02
Can you tell me your name and where you're from?

316
00:25:54:18 --> 00:25:55:14
My name.

317
00:25:55:15 --> 00:25:59:02
My name is Ana, they call me Ana,

318
00:25:59:05 --> 00:26:03:01
but my full name is Ana Luisa,
my clan is xxx

319
00:26:04:08 --> 00:26:06:17
and well, I am from here.

320
00:26:08:22 --> 00:26:10:26
Over there where we were just now, that's my home

321
00:26:11:14 --> 00:26:15:10
in the community xxx
and well, my family lives here.

322
00:26:28:02 --> 00:26:29:25
Well, how do you identify yourself?

323
00:26:29:25 --> 00:26:32:12
Or what things do you do?

324
00:26:32:29 --> 00:26:36:17
Wayuu Taype, I am Wayuu

325
00:26:38:23 --> 00:26:40:21
Xxx xxx

326
00:26:40:26 --> 00:26:42:15
Xxx xxx

327
00:26:44:04 --> 00:26:46:19
Xxx xxx

328
00:26:47:15 --> 00:26:49:16
Xxx xxx

329
00:26:50:29 --> 00:26:53:24
Well, I am saying that I am Wayuu.

330
00:26:54:14 --> 00:26:56:26
and I am here in my land.

331
00:26:57:14 --> 00:27:00:18
and I don't let our tradition fade away,

332
00:27:02:02 --> 00:27:04:18
just as our ancestors left it for us

333
00:27:04:19 --> 00:27:07:09
and also the new generation.

334
00:27:07:10 --> 00:27:10:23
And here we are.

335
00:27:11:23 --> 00:27:14:18
And what do you do?

336
00:27:14:22 --> 00:27:18:00
I do weaving, and we also make hammocks,

337
00:27:18:29 --> 00:27:22:22
That's the only thing I do this year, like this year

338
00:27:22:23 --> 00:27:27:17
I'm not studying,
but next year, I will go to school.

339
00:27:27:21 --> 00:27:31:13
That's why I dedicate myself only to making backpacks

340
00:27:32:25 --> 00:27:35:02
and also helping my brother.

341
00:27:50:27 --> 00:27:53:00
I also want to ask you, like,

342
00:27:53:01 --> 00:27:56:26
what is your connection
with the natural world, with nature,

343
00:27:56:27 --> 00:27:59:25
personally how do you connect with that,

344
00:27:59:26 --> 00:28:02:08
how do you relate to the natural world?

345
00:28:03:20 --> 00:28:04:28
The natural world

346
00:28:04:29 --> 00:28:08:00
To nature.

347
00:28:09:02 --> 00:28:10:06
Well,

348
00:28:11:12 --> 00:28:14:10
I like the sounds of the little birds

349
00:28:15:13 --> 00:28:19:12
and listening to them every morning and also in the evening,

350
00:28:20:22 --> 00:28:23:09
because they sing twice

351
00:28:24:18 --> 00:28:27:23
in the morning when they wake up

352
00:28:27:27 --> 00:28:30:27
and in the night when they go to sleep.

353
00:28:30:28 --> 00:28:34:21
And well, I like that

354
00:28:35:02 --> 00:28:37:21
and also,

355
00:28:40:20 --> 00:28:41:01
how

356
00:28:41:01 --> 00:28:46:09
do I connect?

357
00:28:54:01 --> 00:28:59:22
And as I tell you, that's it.

358
00:29:09:29 --> 00:29:11:12
Alright, that.

359
00:29:11:14 --> 00:29:13:24
That's what I can say.

360
00:29:14:22 --> 00:29:18:04
Well, in everything you do,
I suppose you connect a bit

361
00:29:18:05 --> 00:29:21:28
with nature.

362
00:29:21:29 --> 00:29:22:25
Yes.

363
00:29:24:05 --> 00:29:26:12
In the weaving too, grinding the

364
00:29:27:11 --> 00:29:28:22
Corn.

365
00:29:29:15 --> 00:29:34:03
Well, yes.

366
00:29:47:18 --> 00:29:50:18
If there's anything else you'd like to share,

367
00:29:50:23 --> 00:29:53:08
any message you could bring to the world.

368
00:29:55:22 --> 00:29:59:02
Well, we all here wish that

369
00:30:00:10 --> 00:30:03:09
you support us with this project and

370
00:30:04:18 --> 00:30:06:26
I wish that this project

371
00:30:08:12 --> 00:30:11:04
can be more recognized outside Colombia

372
00:30:12:11 --> 00:30:16:18
that it grows more,

373
00:30:16:27 --> 00:30:20:13
that people from outside can come

374
00:30:21:23 --> 00:30:24:22
to see our project and

375
00:30:26:04 --> 00:30:28:17
that we don't stay behind so they can know us more.

376
00:30:29:03 --> 00:30:31:27
That's the message.

377
00:30:31:28 --> 00:30:33:24
And what would be your

378
00:30:34:09 --> 00:30:38:25
ultimate goal, your goal for the entire project?

379
00:30:39:28 --> 00:30:43:14
Is that what you just told me, or how?

380
00:30:43:21 --> 00:30:47:03
Our goal is,

381
00:30:47:04 --> 00:30:47:24
as,

382
00:30:50:12 --> 00:30:52:25
to see this grow,

383
00:30:53:11 --> 00:30:57:01
and that we can,

384
00:30:58:24 --> 00:31:01:25
grow this and thus we can all work,

385
00:31:02:18 --> 00:31:07:06
have resources,

386
00:31:09:16 --> 00:31:13:12
because as we are just starting,

387
00:31:14:20 --> 00:31:16:29
as I say,

388
00:31:17:25 --> 00:31:22:02
due to lack of resources,
many times it's that, many times

389
00:31:23:16 --> 00:31:25:13
we stay like this,

390
00:31:25:24 --> 00:31:30:00
but here, here we are, here it is, and here we continue.

391
00:31:39:10 --> 00:31:41:15
What are the

392
00:31:41:24 --> 00:31:49:06
challenges you face here?

393
00:31:49:07 --> 00:31:52:03
The challenges?

394
00:31:52:04 --> 00:31:53:19
Issues

395
00:31:54:27 --> 00:31:57:18
that arise in our work?

396
00:31:57:19 --> 00:31:59:18
Work, yes,

397
00:31:59:27 --> 00:32:02:16
day to day, as part of our routine,

398
00:32:03:06 --> 00:32:05:22
but also in the work, well generally here

399
00:32:25:19 --> 00:32:29:27
Well, the need we face
is the lack of water,

400
00:32:35:08 --> 00:32:36:29
Because, I mean,

401
00:32:37:00 --> 00:32:39:00
where my house is, in the community,

402
00:32:40:01 --> 00:32:42:15
we don't have water nearby

403
00:32:42:25 --> 00:32:45:16
to say, only the xxx

404
00:32:46:17 --> 00:32:51:07
because the water we drink is from another community that is our family's

405
00:32:52:14 --> 00:32:56:05
but it's from another community
and that's what we face daily,

406
00:32:57:25 --> 00:33:02:08
lack of water, and

407
00:33:05:15 --> 00:33:08:08
what else?

408
00:33:08:09 --> 00:33:11:29
As for grazing,

409
00:33:12:09 --> 00:33:14:07
Like what,

410
00:33:14:08 --> 00:33:25:03
what things or what things?

411
00:33:25:04 --> 00:33:27:16
As I was saying, the water
