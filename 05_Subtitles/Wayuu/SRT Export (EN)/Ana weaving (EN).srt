1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,958
Well.

2
00:00:02,875 --> 00:00:04,958
Can you explain to me what the project is that you're setting up here?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,291
That you're setting up here?

4
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:11,791
Well, we have a project.

5
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:14,125
We have a store.

6
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:16,333
They call it xxx.

7
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:20,625
xxx is...

8
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:21,125
Well.

9
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,750
This project is called "Threads for xxx" (Má).

10
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,041
And this project

11
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:34,958
involves fabrics, backpacks, various kinds of backpacks.

12
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:40,958
And well, where we are right now,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,208
this is where the people live

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,916
that we partner with to do

15
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:50,875
this project

16
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,458
which is about, which is about the backpack,

17
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:57,166
we do an exchange

18
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:05,000
of recycling and all that it involves.

19
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:09,000
And well,

20
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:12,708
we do this for the good of our community,

21
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:16,916
a cleanup.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,916
And that's why it says "Threads for xxx."

23
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,916
It's for the good of

24
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:30,208
our community, our land.
And here, you can see a lot of

25
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:32,708
this,

26
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:36,416
the pollution that

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,208
is very common in La Guajira,

28
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,125
and that's why we are working on

29
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:46,166
that, on this project,

30
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,541
and well, we are happy.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,333
What is pollution, what kind of pollution?

32
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,166
Well, when we talk about pollution,

33
00:01:56,291 --> 00:02:00,750
it's related to garbage,

34
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:06,125
with papers, everything related to consumerism,

35
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:08,791
and that

36
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,666
and well, we're trying to collect all of that and

37
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:18,916
to do an exchange, as I was saying, as I mentioned earlier.

38
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,541
What is the thread made of?

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,250
The thread...

40
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,916
The thread...

41
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,708
Like, I mean, what is it? How did it come about?

42
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:39,041
Yes, the thread. I mean, are you using plastic to create the thread?

43
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:43,208
And that's like cleaning it up, helping in that aspect?

44
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,250
Yes, helping like...

45
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,625
As you were saying, it helps our community,

46
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,041
As you mentioned,

47
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:55,666
it helps our community in a way,

48
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,208
because we, the Wayuu people,

49
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,750
it's like, let's say,

50
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,750
well, since here in the ranchería

51
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:12,083
is already full of garbage and all that,

52
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:16,166
so, to improve a bit of this, a bit of that,

53
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,000
that's why this project was born.

54
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,750
and precisely to help our family

55
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,791
and all our relatives.

56
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,791
That's why this project is here.

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,250
Yes, so, tell me about your work here.

58
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,208
What do you do with the jewelry?

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,916
How do you manage them? Or

60
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,208
What threads do you use? What fabrics?

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,375
Well, on our side, my mom and I,

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,625
we always use wool.

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,041
The question is not... here we use wool.

64
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,083
We make things like this,

65
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,375
like plastic that is collected,

66
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,958
they are taken to the cleaning stations in Manaure,

67
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:26,708
and as for cardboard and other reusable materials,

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,125
the recycling center, they give some coins for it,

69
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,208
so they work on it,

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,416
but we don't dye with plastic or anything like that.

71
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,166
And what designs?

72
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:46,041
What things do you make here or what kind of backpacks?

73
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:51,041
Yes, backpacks, and also chinchorros.

74
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,000
And

75
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,958
the backpacks, they have a

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,416
color, some of them have

77
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:05,458
what they call "beds," which have various colors,

78
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,208
my mom is showing them.

79
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,791
It's very beautiful.

80
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,041
These are the backpacks,

81
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,375
and well, as for the question, how is my work here?

82
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,166
Yes, so what do you do?

83
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,166
What are the symbols?

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,625
The symbols,

85
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,583
Here, there are various types of weaving.

86
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,458
And well, as my brother said,

87
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,000
That's why my work is related to this.

88
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:11,541
That's why I don't know much...
And he is the one in charge of everything when he goes to the town.

89
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,833
that's it, well, and my duty here

90
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:19,208
is to take care of the people,

91
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,541
how many backpacks we deliver,

92
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:26,333
this,

93
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,916
And well,

94
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,208
and as I was saying, there are various kinds of backpacks,

95
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:36,083
many times in xxx, there's one they call,

96
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,958
well, the ones with multiple colors are the basket-like ones.

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,541
And there's one that's called xxx here,

98
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:02,166
there's a type of weaving called xxx,

99
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,041
in xxx,

100
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:11,083
it's not this one, it's very, very different from this.

101
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:15,083
And how did you learn to weave?

102
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,166
Weaving, like

103
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,083
what weaving has to do with our ancestors,

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,458
you learn from a young age because here, everyone knows how to weave.

105
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:30,041
We are all taught, as we are Wayuu, and it's one of the things

106
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:34,166
one of the most important things in our culture
and that's why, as Wayuu,

107
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,333
we have to know that.

108
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,125
That's why I learned to weave since I was a child.

109
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,375
Watching your mom?

110
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,083
My mom and my grandmother

111
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,208
and all the other relatives

112
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:51,708
and so on.

113
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,166
And what importance does weaving have in the culture?

114
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:01,166
It is very important because

115
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:06,041
there's a narration that my grandmother used to tell,

116
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,625
that in the past, before,

117
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,041
one day,

118
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,166
there was a girl,

119
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,208
about how weaving was born,

120
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,708
that's what I'm going to talk about now, how it was born,

121
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,250
there was a girl,

122
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,083
her name was xxx,

123
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:34,958
And well,

124
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,250
that girl was,

125
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:42,458
she was like she was lost, she had no family,

126
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,791
And one day, a boy

127
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:51,333
came out, he was shepherding

128
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,958
and he found that girl.

129
00:09:56,208 --> 00:10:00,000
And he asked her where she came from,
but the girl didn't speak,

130
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,166
and she was young.

131
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,708
And well, he took her to his house,

132
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,833
he took her there, but they didn't know who her family was,

133
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,666
and then,

134
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:18,625
time passed, and the girl stayed
in the boy's house with his family.

135
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:23,000
She had been there, and at night,

136
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,375
at night, she would make chimchorros, but no one knew about it,

137
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,250
that was a secret,

138
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:34,041
and she would make chimchorros

139
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:35,916
and also

140
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,333
she also made backpacks, but on her own, just by herself

141
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,125
And no one could know about it

142
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,250
And people were surprised

143
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,000
in the morning

144
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,041
They saw that, and where did that come from?

145
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,000
And since she didn't speak, she just kept looking,

146
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,708
and that went on, time passed,

147
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,750
and she made many things,

148
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,041
the hammocks,

149
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,083
and then, until one day,

150
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,750
the boy,

151
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,708
the girl had grown up,

152
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,750
she had become a young lady right there, and they locked her up

153
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,416
And she still did that

154
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,083
And well, until one day, the boy

155
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:28,041
who didn't mean to, entered the house

156
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,708
and found her doing that, and no one could see her,

157
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,500
And well, she disappeared.

158
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,208
Because she's not a normal girl, so to speak,

159
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,791
and that's how it was born,

160
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:45,208
that's how it remained for us,

161
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,083
the Wayuu people,

162
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,125
and it's one of the things, one of the customs,

163
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,000
most important

164
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,041
in our culture.

165
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,083
And does it have something to do with the spiderweb they also weave?

166
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:06,375
Oh yes, the spiderweb

167
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,875
also, because spiderweb

168
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,416
in Spanish is "telaraña," in Wayuu it's "xxx"

169
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,875
It's the same in words, in Wayuu it's "xxx"

170
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,166
and that.

171
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,375
And do you learn from them too?

172
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,708
Yes, of course.

173
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,083
That's why today you can see what weaving is,
thanks to her.

174
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:37,583
to the spiderweb.

175
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,000
How many hours a day to create one?

176
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,416
One backpack,

177
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:57,166
The smallest one,

178
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,291
My grandmother is very fast because I am a bit slow,

179
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:05,041
sometimes it takes me two days for one backpack,

180
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:11,083
My grandmother sometimes makes two backpacks a day.

181
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:16,041
Well,
the big ones like that last a day, the small ones

182
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,416
you make two

183
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:22,166
backpacks a day, as I was saying,

184
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,541
And well, here I also have a little nephew

185
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,875
who also makes the xxx

186
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,625
What is it?

187
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,291
The handle of the backpack

188
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,666
He also knows how to make it, that one.

189
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,666
And does he do it there?

190
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:48,041
Yes, and that's in progress.

191
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:05,208
And the designs, where
do you get inspiration for the designs?

192
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:11,125
Inspiration has to do with nature,

193
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,750
For example,

194
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,166
like the clouds,

195
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,083
like the water, which is blue,

196
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,125
That's why many are inspired by that,

197
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:33,500
and the red color of blood.

198
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,166
Can you tell me the name of,

199
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:42,000
the meaning, the significance
of the name

200
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:46,041
of the store and the project and all that?

201
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,625
Xxx, aha, xxx,

202
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,166
What does it mean?

203
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,000
And what does it have to do with?

204
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,083
Well, xxx

205
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,625
means

206
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:02,208
Well, xxx

207
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,291
What does that word mean?

208
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,041
Well,

209
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,208
that has to do with

210
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,125
with the red color,

211
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:18,208
which is the color of blood, that identifies us

212
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,416
many times, especially in our culture,

213
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,000
that blood is important,

214
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:30,291
and that's why we put it there,
it represents the red color

215
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,375
xxx. Yes.

216
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:58,791
Can you once again
talk a little more about the inspiration

217
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,125
from nature in the textiles,

218
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,083
how does it come out?

219
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,166
How is that?

220
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,958
In the textiles?

221
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,916
Well, when it comes to
nature, as I was saying,

222
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,833
the water,

223
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:23,000
also these,

224
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,041
the cardones, also

225
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:39,416
there are many types of plants
that sometimes one

226
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,791
also

227
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,125
the clouds,

228
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,750
that is also one of the inspirations, and that's why

229
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,083
we also incorporate it into the weaving

230
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
in this,

231
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:57,166
does this backpack
have inspirations from symbols

232
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,166
that have some meaning?

233
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,083
Trash bins.

234
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,750
And the learning of it,

235
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:39,916
at what age do they start weaving

236
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:40,541
in each

237
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,375
community, in each family too?

238
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,666
At what age?

239
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,708
At seven or eight years old,

240
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,083
they

241
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,541
are taught,

242
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,666
but girls also, sometimes,

243
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,833
if they want to learn, they start at five years old.

244
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,166
they start like that, and boys too,

245
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,750
even boys know how to weave.

246
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,916
Not just women? No

247
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:17,875
Yes, even boys and also older people, even men.

248
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:22,750
Most of them, everyone knows how to weave.

249
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,875
And is it something traditional, traditional here? Yes

250
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,083
Yes,

251
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,708
because here the backpacks

252
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,208
here,

253
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:40,208
we have a great need,

254
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,333
craftsmanship related to weaving

255
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,833
is what, as I told you,

256
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,250
it's what

257
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,291
because sometimes we make backpacks, right,

258
00:19:56,333 --> 00:20:00,416
We take around 20, 25 of them to the town

259
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,041
and we sell them

260
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,583
and buy more thread and

261
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,125
We also buy things for consumption.

262
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:14,166
That's why it's very important,
because we depend on that,

263
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,000
since there is no work here.

264
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:24,375
That's why we depend on the trade
of backpacks, hammocks, and all handicrafts.

265
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,250
That's why it's very important,

266
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,250
that's why men also start to

267
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,875
make backpacks.

268
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:39,541
Do you feel connected to your roots

269
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:45,000
when you do this? Do you feel
connected to your roots while weaving?

270
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:49,666
Yes, yes, we are happy,

271
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,125
and beyond, outside of

272
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,083
Colombia, they recognize us more because of this

273
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,041
and that's why we are very proud to be Wayuu

274
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,000
and we will never stop weaving.

275
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:07,041
We will always weave for the new generation.

276
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,375
Always,

277
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,666
our tradition will always continue.

278
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,250
And that's it.

279
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:17,250
Are these backpacks famous throughout Colombia?

280
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:21,875
Yes, outside of Colombia, they are known all over the world.

281
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:26,375
And is this the emblematic one of the Wayuu, this one?

282
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,083
Well, yes, this one represents the Wayuu,

283
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,625
what the weaving is.

284
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,416
Yes, I've seen it all over the world.

285
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:43,083
Also, all over Colombia.

286
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,958
Also, another question. Can you explain to me what "Xxx" is?

287
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,458
Xxx?

288
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,250
Earth,

289
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,666
Sand, "Xxx."

290
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:01,833
It's earth, "Xxx": land.

291
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:06,083
And what does it mean to you?

292
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,166
"Threads for Xxx."

293
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:12,083
It's thread for our land,

294
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,833
and our land is

295
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:15,666
what is here.

296
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:18,583
That's why, because of our land,
we are working.

297
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:21,791
That means for our land.

298
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:25,083
For our land,
this project was born.

299
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:29,541
For how to take better care of it,

300
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:33,500
for the environment,

301
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:36,166
taking care of our surroundings.

302
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,041
And that's it.

303
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,500
Nothing more.

304
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,541
Is it related, like all of this art,

305
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:12,083
and craftsmanship,

306
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,541
and the threads for xxx?

307
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,125
Threads

308
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,625
For xxx,

309
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,958
it's the thread related to craftsmanship.

310
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,666
And that's why

311
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:27,541
the weaving,

312
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:31,125
and that's why, as the thread forms.

313
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:34,833
And it has to do with craftsmanship,

314
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:39,250
and that's why everything is very important.

315
00:25:50,958 --> 00:25:54,083
Can you tell me your name and where you're from?

316
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,583
My name.

317
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:59,083
My name is Ana, they call me Ana,

318
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:03,041
but my full name is Ana Luisa,
my clan is xxx

319
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:06,708
and well, I am from here.

320
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:11,083
Over there where we were just now, that's my home

321
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:15,416
in the community xxx
and well, my family lives here.

322
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:30,041
Well, how do you identify yourself?

323
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:32,500
Or what things do you do?

324
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:36,708
Wayuu Taype, I am Wayuu

325
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:40,875
Xxx xxx

326
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,625
Xxx xxx

327
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:46,791
Xxx xxx

328
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,666
Xxx xxx

329
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:54,000
Well, I am saying that I am Wayuu.

330
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:57,083
and I am here in my land.

331
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:00,750
and I don't let our tradition fade away,

332
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:04,750
just as our ancestors left it for us

333
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:07,375
and also the new generation.

334
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:10,958
And here we are.

335
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:14,750
And what do you do?

336
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:18,000
I do weaving, and we also make hammocks,

337
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:22,916
That's the only thing I do this year, like this year

338
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:27,708
I'm not studying,
but next year, I will go to school.

339
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:31,541
That's why I dedicate myself only to making backpacks

340
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:35,083
and also helping my brother.

341
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:53,000
I also want to ask you, like,

342
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:57,083
what is your connection
with the natural world, with nature,

343
00:27:57,125 --> 00:28:00,041
personally how do you connect with that,

344
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:02,333
how do you relate to the natural world?

345
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,166
The natural world

346
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:08,000
To nature.

347
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:10,250
Well,

348
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,416
I like the sounds of the little birds

349
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:19,500
and listening to them every morning and also in the evening,

350
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:23,375
because they sing twice

351
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,958
in the morning when they wake up

352
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:31,125
and in the night when they go to sleep.

353
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:34,875
And well, I like that

354
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:37,875
and also,

355
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:41,041
how

356
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:46,375
do I connect?

357
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:59,916
And as I tell you, that's it.

358
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,500
Alright, that.

359
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,000
That's what I can say.

360
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:18,166
Well, in everything you do,
I suppose you connect a bit

361
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:22,166
with nature.

362
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:23,041
Yes.

363
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:26,500
In the weaving too, grinding the

364
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:28,916
Corn.

365
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:34,125
Well, yes.

366
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,750
If there's anything else you'd like to share,

367
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:53,333
any message you could bring to the world.

368
00:29:55,916 --> 00:29:59,083
Well, we all here wish that

369
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:03,375
you support us with this project and

370
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,083
I wish that this project

371
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,166
can be more recognized outside Colombia

372
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:16,750
that it grows more,

373
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:20,541
that people from outside can come

374
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:24,916
to see our project and

375
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:28,708
that we don't stay behind so they can know us more.

376
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:32,125
That's the message.

377
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,000
And what would be your

378
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:39,041
ultimate goal, your goal for the entire project?

379
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:43,583
Is that what you just told me, or how?

380
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,125
Our goal is,

381
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,000
as,

382
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,041
to see this grow,

383
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:57,041
and that we can,

384
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,041
grow this and thus we can all work,

385
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:07,250
have resources,

386
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:13,500
because as we are just starting,

387
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,208
as I say,

388
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:22,083
due to lack of resources,
many times it's that, many times

389
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:25,541
we stay like this,

390
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
but here, here we are, here it is, and here we continue.

391
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:41,625
What are the

392
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,250
challenges you face here?

393
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:52,125
The challenges?

394
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:53,791
Issues

395
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:57,750
that arise in our work?

396
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,750
Work, yes,

397
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:02,666
day to day, as part of our routine,

398
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,916
but also in the work, well generally here

399
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:30,125
Well, the need we face
is the lack of water,

400
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,208
Because, I mean,

401
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
where my house is, in the community,

402
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,625
we don't have water nearby

403
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:45,666
to say, only the xxx

404
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:51,291
because the water we drink is from another community that is our family's

405
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:56,208
but it's from another community
and that's what we face daily,

406
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:02,333
lack of water, and

407
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:08,333
what else?

408
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:12,208
As for grazing,

409
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,291
Like what,

410
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:25,125
what things or what things?

411
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:27,666
As I was saying, the water
