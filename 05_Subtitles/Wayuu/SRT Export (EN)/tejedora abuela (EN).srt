1
00:17 --> 00:22
Can you tell us a bit about how

2
00:23 --> 00:27
The plants work when someone is sick. How
do you identify them?

3
00:31 --> 00:34
I have heard, for example, that plants are known
through dreams

4
00:35 --> 00:39
Also because they are in our environment

5
00:40 --> 00:45
Can you talk about that now? Yes of course.

6
00:49 --> 00:55
Our female elders know about plants through sleep

7
00:57 --> 01:00
These are plants that our father Juya gives us (rain)

8
01:01 --> 01:07
They dream of the plant, he meets them and they become their
recommended medicines

9
01:08 --> 01:13
This is how they learned about the plants, our traditional medicines.

10
01:14 --> 01:19
Plants like kinouta, wuinpiraicha, samu'tapaya and malambo.

11
01:21 --> 01:25
We also know those that we find on the banks
of the stream, we know those as well

12
01:27 --> 01:28
That's what the old women told me

13
01:30 --> 01:35
That's what I can tell you for now

14
01:37 --> 01:46
I also want to tell you that I am very happy
for seeing my fabrics, thank you my grandson who records me

15
01:47 --> 01:49
This shows what we are for years

16
01:50 --> 01:59
Do you remember when we met last time, I
I am very glad that Neko is dedicating to this

17
02:00 --> 02:07
I am a Christian and I ask God to allow
everything to go well because I know that later

18
02:08 --> 02:14
You will help me and that if something happens to me, I know that
he will say it to those who see and hear me.

19
02:15 --> 02:21
I was going to be busy today, I was going to a funeral

20
02:22 --> 02:29
But I had this commitment to you and I must fulfill it
because I really appreciate what you do

21
02:31 --> 02:37
I told myself that what you (are doing) is very good and I know
that later you will remember me

22
02:38 --> 02:47
I am very happy and grateful for the threads that
you gave me as a gift because you help me in one way or another

23
02:48 --> 02:56
I just hope you don't give me the threads only now,
but also when you are successful

24
02:57 --> 03:01
Because that's how I can keep knitting too.
I have been knitting for so many years

25
03:02 --> 03:06
Here are some children that I take them to see the yonna

26
03:08 --> 03:10
I always take those children

27
03:11 --> 03:13
They’ve been with me for several years now and it makes me glad

28
03:14 --> 03:22
Here I have a grandson, and I imagine him working like you,
I want him to think of big things

29
03:23 --> 03:29
And well, that's what I wanted to tell you today

30
03:30 --> 03:34
Well I figured you wanted to know too

31
03:36 --> 03:40
That's right, thank God that we're okay

32
03:41 --> 03:45
Well and to continue with the theme of plants

33
03:46 --> 03:51
Could you tell us which plant you have come to know through
any dream you have had?

34
03:52 --> 03:54
A new one you didn't know before

35
03:55 --> 04:03
Do not tell us the ones we already know, but one that only you
you met through your dream

36
04:04 --> 04:13
Or can you tell us a story about someone
that discovered a plant through the dream

37
04:14 --> 04:21
It could be the Yonira who dreamed of a plant that only she knows

38
04:22 --> 04:23
oh sure it could be that

39
04:24 --> 04:30
Once a lady came up to me at the moment
I was knitting

40
04:31 --> 04:34
She told me that she had dreamed of a lady who told her

41
04:35 --> 04:42
that I was the only one who could prepare the plant
for her to heal

42
04:43 --> 04:52
That I should prepare it for her because I had the same
disease than she had

43
04:53 --> 05:00
Since I dreamed of the plant that cured me, I should
prepared it for it to be effective

44
05:01 --> 05:05
So I prepared them for her, I took 10 shots of the same plant

45
05:06 --> 05:13
In the dream they told her that this was what she should
drink and that I should prepare it

46
05:14 --> 05:20
Because I already have the gift of the wisdom of the
healing medicinal plants

47
05:21 --> 05:28
Since that plant had cured me and saved my life now
I have the strength of that plant in my hands

48
05:31 --> 05:38
The plant I dreamed of to later prescribe it is
that one, they showed me that one over there

49
05:41 --> 05:47
The cardon, the yotojoro (heart of the cardon) with the coralline

50
05:49 --> 05:53
And also, apart from the cardón

51
05:57 --> 06:01
They told me something in the dream that prevented my death

52
06:02 --> 06:05
That I take a sira'chon ask what was that?

53
06:06 --> 06:14
He told me it was a pui (branch of a plant) that I have it
in there

54
06:15 --> 06:20
You can see it there. So I did it and I always took it

55
06:21 --> 06:29
They also asked her through a dream
to that person who came to me

56
06:30 --> 06:34
Same thing happened with another person, it’s been two
People who were sent by the dream

57
06:36 --> 06:38
After a dream revealed it to me first

58
06:39 --> 06:46
The others dreamed of the indication that they had to come to me

59
06:47 --> 06:50
This is how sleep is connected with plants

60
08:23 --> 08:25
ok another question

61
08:27 --> 08:34
You know that all plants have a
spiritual connotation right? Yeah.

62
08:36 --> 08:39
There are some plants that have their spirits

63
08:40 --> 08:45
That's why when preparing them, you have to talk to them,
just like with the bath plants

64
08:46 --> 08:54
Some plants, if picked without offering what the spirits ask for, get angry

65
08:55 --> 09:03
If it is a female plant, it tells you "why are you giving me
So, you must give me something for using me."

66
09:06 --> 09:13
Well, you're the one who knows about that.
yes i see it too

67
09:15 --> 09:21
Exactly, plants ask for fabrics, it's like
reward for lending, you can tell them that

68
09:22 --> 09:29
Tell them how it works and what should be done

69
09:30 --> 09:35
Yes, I know plants very well, but one day a person

70
09:36 --> 09:43
asked me for some plants and I went to cut them and a branch

71
09:44 --> 09:47
It hit me in my eye and I had to lay down 3 days for that

72
09:49 --> 09:53
Then I dreamed of a lady who told me “Why did you do that to me"

73
09:54 --> 09:55
that was her spirit

74
09:56 --> 10:03
She told me that this was the first and last time he did that with her,
to offer her just like that

75
10:04 --> 10:06
Ohterwise, she would do the same to me

76
10:07 --> 10:10
The person who asked for it told me that it was my fault if it didn't heal

77
10:12 --> 10:19
I told him no, because he should have given me thread or a red cloth
to offset the spirit

78
10:20 --> 10:27
I speak to him as I give them to him. I tell him help me
with the plant and so nothing happens to me

79
10:28 --> 10:35
If a person tells me it's my fault I tell them
no, in fact it affected me

80
10:36 --> 10:41
So plants do have a spiritual connotation

81
10:42 --> 10:46
Very important and sacred to us

82
10:48 --> 10:51
that's how it works

83
10:54 --> 11:00
There is also the plant that is used for
baby or children's baths

84
11:01 --> 11:08
If I prepare her without giving her anything before, she will
manifest your spirit too

85
11:09 --> 11:12
That is the spirit of the plant wi'toi (peppermint)

86
11:13 --> 11:18
Those who ask me for baths know that they must
bring me thread for the plant

87
11:19 --> 11:22
I have had dreams where they ask me to take the
plant to certain children

88
11:23 --> 11:31
Her spirit commands me and asks me for the threads for her
to make up for it

89
11:31 --> 11:39
But if a person asks me without giving anything in return
I do not accept it because I am already warned by the plant

90
11:40 --> 11:46
Instead, people who know, bring me something
like threads or money

91
11:47 --> 11:54
The plants are satisfied with that, as well as me.
with my fabric, or threads or money

92
11:55 --> 11:57
This is what I can tell you for now about it.

93
12:01 --> 12:06
Well, to continue with the topic there is something

94
12:07 --> 12:13
That I have heard, that the plants are not
available everywhere

95
12:14 --> 12:20
Where do the plants come from to get here?

96
12:21 --> 12:29
for example, I have heard that the plant for babies is
on the top of the mountains

97
12:30 --> 12:37
And only those sent by the dream find them there because

98
12:38 --> 12:40
If someone else goes, they won't find it. Yeah true

99
12:41 --> 12:46
But if that plant is for that person
appears to her

100
12:47 --> 12:53
If that plant wants to fall into the hands of a person
it just appears

101
12:54 --> 12:58
And it connects with that person

102
13:21 --> 12:29
Can you tell us about the other plants?

103
13:30 --> 13:36
Because we know that some come from plants,

104
13:37 --> 13:41
While others do not, such as kasuou (white bun)

105
13:42 --> 13:46
The kasushi? Yes, that same one is not made from a plant, right?

106
13:47 --> 13:49
No, that is not the product of the rain

107
13:50 --> 13:58
That one in the shape of a bun and it comes from a stone that comes out
in the north zone

108
14:02 --> 14:07
Can you talk about it, that some of them come from plants

109
14:08 --> 14:12
And others come from stones or mud such as kasushi

110
14:13 --> 14:15
Yes, it is true, they are not a product of the rain

111
14:16 --> 14:25
There is the red bija, uslisha is also formed in stones

112
14:26 --> 14:32
Yes, can you tell us about those medicines?

113
14:33 --> 14:40
that come from plants and others from mountains

114
14:46 --> 14:53
Well, kasushi doesn't come from a plant as such.
but from a mountain

115
14:54 --> 15:01
They are medicines for the ladies just like the ulisha

116
15:02 --> 15:07
And they are not fruits or leaves of plants

117
15:10 --> 15:16
The ladies drink them and they come out of more mountains
in great masses

118
15:18 --> 15:22
The ulisha and the kasuchi are from the mountains in the north

119
15:30 --> 15:35
And why don't you tell them (about)the plant that is for the
crying children

120
15:36 --> 15:42
Yes, of course, there is a plant that if it doesn't rain, I have to
travel miles to find her

121
15:47 --> 15:54
If nobody grows them, they are hard to find and
many people desperately search for it

122
15:56 --> 16:01
And the plant called jirupu?

123
16:02 --> 16:08
This plant only grows in the Perijá mountain range (between
north of Santander - Colombia and Zulia state-Venezuela)
