1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Can you tell us a bit about how

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The plants work when someone is sick. How
do you identify them?

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I have heard, for example, that plants are known
through dreams

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Also because they are in our environment

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Can you talk about that now? Yes of course.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Our female elders know about plants through sleep

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
These are plants that our father Juya gives us (rain)

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
They dream of the plant, he meets them and they become their
recommended medicines

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is how they learned about the plants, our traditional medicines.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Plants like kinouta, wuinpiraicha, samu'tapaya and malambo.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We also know those that we find on the banks
of the stream, we know those as well

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's what the old women told me

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's what I can tell you for now

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I also want to tell you that I am very happy
for seeing my fabrics, thank you my grandson who records me

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This shows what we are for years

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Do you remember when we met last time, I
I am very glad that Neko is dedicating to this

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I am a Christian and I ask God to allow
everything to go well because I know that later

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You will help me and that if something happens to me, I know that
he will say it to those who see and hear me.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I was going to be busy today, I was going to a funeral

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But I had this commitment to you and I must fulfill it
because I really appreciate what you do

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I told myself that what you (are doing) is very good and I know
that later you will remember me

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I am very happy and grateful for the threads that
you gave me as a gift because you help me in one way or another

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I just hope you don't give me the threads only now,
but also when you are successful

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Because that's how I can keep knitting too.
I have been knitting for so many years

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Here are some children that I take them to see the yonna

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I always take those children

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
They’ve been with me for several years now and it makes me glad

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Here I have a grandson, and I imagine him working like you,
I want him to think of big things

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And well, that's what I wanted to tell you today

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Well I figured you wanted to know too

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's right, thank God that we're okay

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Well and to continue with the theme of plants

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Could you tell us which plant you have come to know through
any dream you have had?

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
A new one you didn't know before

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Do not tell us the ones we already know, but one that only you
you met through your dream

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Or can you tell us a story about someone
that discovered a plant through the dream

37
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It could be the Yonira who dreamed of a plant that only she knows

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
oh sure it could be that

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Once a lady came up to me at the moment
I was knitting

40
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
She told me that she had dreamed of a lady who told her

41
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
that I was the only one who could prepare the plant
for her to heal

42
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That I should prepare it for her because I had the same
disease than she had

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Since I dreamed of the plant that cured me, I should
prepared it for it to be effective

44
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So I prepared them for her, I took 10 shots of the same plant

45
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
In the dream they told her that this was what she should
drink and that I should prepare it

46
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Because I already have the gift of the wisdom of the
healing medicinal plants

47
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Since that plant had cured me and saved my life now
I have the strength of that plant in my hands

48
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The plant I dreamed of to later prescribe it is
that one, they showed me that one over there

49
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The cardon, the yotojoro (heart of the cardon) with the coralline

50
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And also, apart from the cardón

51
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
They told me something in the dream that prevented my death

52
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That I take a sira'chon ask what was that?

53
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He told me it was a pui (branch of a plant) that I have it
in there

54
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You can see it there. So I did it and I always took it

55
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
They also asked her through a dream
to that person who came to me

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Same thing happened with another person, it’s been two
People who were sent by the dream

57
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
After a dream revealed it to me first

58
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The others dreamed of the indication that they had to come to me

59
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This is how sleep is connected with plants

60
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
ok another question

61
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You know that all plants have a
spiritual connotation right? Yeah.

62
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There are some plants that have their spirits

63
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's why when preparing them, you have to talk to them,
just like with the bath plants

64
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Some plants, if picked without offering what the spirits ask for, get angry

65
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
If it is a female plant, it tells you "why are you giving me
So, you must give me something for using me."

66
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Well, you're the one who knows about that.
yes i see it too

67
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Exactly, plants ask for fabrics, it's like
reward for lending, you can tell them that

68
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Tell them how it works and what should be done

69
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yes, I know plants very well, but one day a person

70
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
asked me for some plants and I went to cut them and a branch

71
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It hit me in my eye and I had to lay down 3 days for that

72
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Then I dreamed of a lady who told me “Why did you do that to me"

73
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
that was her spirit

74
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
She told me that this was the first and last time he did that with her,
to offer her just like that

75
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Ohterwise, she would do the same to me

76
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The person who asked for it told me that it was my fault if it didn't heal

77
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I told him no, because he should have given me thread or a red cloth
to offset the spirit

78
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I speak to him as I give them to him. I tell him help me
with the plant and so nothing happens to me

79
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
If a person tells me it's my fault I tell them
no, in fact it affected me

80
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So plants do have a spiritual connotation

81
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Very important and sacred to us

82
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
that's how it works

83
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
There is also the plant that is used for
baby or children's baths

84
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
If I prepare her without giving her anything before, she will
manifest your spirit too

85
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That is the spirit of the plant wi'toi (peppermint)

86
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Those who ask me for baths know that they must
bring me thread for the plant

87
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I have had dreams where they ask me to take the
plant to certain children

88
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Her spirit commands me and asks me for the threads for her
to make up for it

89
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But if a person asks me without giving anything in return
I do not accept it because I am already warned by the plant

90
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Instead, people who know, bring me something
like threads or money

91
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The plants are satisfied with that, as well as me.
with my fabric, or threads or money

92
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
This is what I can tell you for now about it.

93
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Well, to continue with the topic there is something

94
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That I have heard, that the plants are not
available everywhere

95
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Where do the plants come from to get here?

96
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,000
for example, I have heard that the plant for babies is
on the top of the mountains

97
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And only those sent by the dream find them there because

98
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
If someone else goes, they won't find it. Yeah true

99
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But if that plant is for that person
appears to her

100
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If that plant wants to fall into the hands of a person
it just appears

101
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And it connects with that person

102
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Can you tell us about the other plants?

103
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Because we know that some come from plants,

104
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
While others do not, such as kasuou (white bun)

105
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The kasushi? Yes, that same one is not made from a plant, right?

106
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No, that is not the product of the rain

107
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That one in the shape of a bun and it comes from a stone that comes out
in the north zone

108
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Can you talk about it, that some of them come from plants

109
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And others come from stones or mud such as kasushi

110
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yes, it is true, they are not a product of the rain

111
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,000
There is the red bija, uslisha is also formed in stones

112
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yes, can you tell us about those medicines?

113
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
that come from plants and others from mountains

114
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Well, kasushi doesn't come from a plant as such.
but from a mountain

115
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
They are medicines for the ladies just like the ulisha

116
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And they are not fruits or leaves of plants

117
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The ladies drink them and they come out of more mountains
in great masses

118
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The ulisha and the kasuchi are from the mountains in the north

119
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And why don't you tell them (about)the plant that is for the
crying children

120
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes, of course, there is a plant that if it doesn't rain, I have to
travel miles to find her

121
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
If nobody grows them, they are hard to find and
many people desperately search for it

122
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And the plant called jirupu?

123
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
This plant only grows in the Perijá mountain range (between
north of Santander - Colombia and Zulia state-Venezuela)
