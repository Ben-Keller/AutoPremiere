1
00:01:06:08 --> 00:01:08:14
Can you explain what you are doing?

2
00:01:08:14 --> 00:01:11:14
This is a portable lamp.

3
00:01:11:15 --> 00:01:13:15
A Solar LED lamp

4
00:01:16:01 --> 00:01:19:01
Well this is what we did

5
00:01:19:19 --> 00:01:22:14
in India.

6
00:01:22:14 --> 00:01:25:14
I can put together this plate,

7
00:01:26:20 --> 00:01:29:20
but since the batteries are already there.

8
00:01:31:09 --> 00:01:32:14
With this lot,

9
00:01:32:14 --> 00:01:35:14
this lamp charges

10
00:01:37:00 --> 00:01:38:18
From the sunlight,

11
00:01:38:18 --> 00:01:41:17
This one is 10 volts.

12
00:01:41:17 --> 00:01:43:12
Yeah,

13
00:01:43:12 --> 00:01:46:20
10 volts and 7 amperes

14
00:01:53:05 --> 00:01:55:21
I,

15
00:01:55:21 --> 00:01:58:21
From India I learned to assemble.

16
00:01:59:04 --> 00:02:02:04
This is the plate of this lamp

17
00:02:03:17 --> 00:02:06:17
that I can put together myself.

18
00:02:06:18 --> 00:02:08:07
These are the components.

19
00:02:08:07 --> 00:02:11:07
These are the components.

20
00:02:11:12 --> 00:02:14:12
Yes, they are the components.

21
00:02:14:21 --> 00:02:17:10
Here are the resistors.

22
00:02:17:10 --> 00:02:20:00
These are resistors.

23
00:02:20:00 --> 00:02:23:00
These are,

24
00:02:23:03 --> 00:02:25:00
resistors.

25
00:02:25:00 --> 00:02:27:14
These are the

26
00:02:27:14 --> 00:02:29:06
AISI.

27
00:02:29:06 --> 00:02:32:02
The diodes, the

28
00:02:32:02 --> 00:02:35:01
capacitors that are diodes.

29
00:02:35:21 --> 00:02:38:03
This is an offer .

30
00:02:38:03 --> 00:02:41:05
This is a transformer, a capacitor.

31
00:02:42:11 --> 00:02:44:19
This is another capacitor.

32
00:02:44:19 --> 00:02:47:15
This is a

33
00:02:47:15 --> 00:02:49:01
I knew this

34
00:02:49:01 --> 00:02:50:23
and I learned that there.

35
00:02:50:23 --> 00:02:53:23
These are the components of this plate.

36
00:02:54:07 --> 00:02:56:11
I can put this together

37
00:02:56:11 --> 00:02:59:11
and I have my book, through the book it was

38
00:03:00:07 --> 00:03:03:07
that I learned to put together

39
00:03:03:19 --> 00:03:05:18
each component.

40
00:03:05:18 --> 00:03:08:18
If I don't set this up well, it doesn't turn on.

41
00:03:10:08 --> 00:03:11:21
But through this

42
00:03:11:21 --> 00:03:15:10
I repeated it every day, the teacher would tell us

43
00:03:17:23 --> 00:03:20:23
that a resistance of

44
00:03:22:11 --> 00:03:25:11
R22.

45
00:03:25:14 --> 00:03:27:08
Well, they taught us colors

46
00:03:27:08 --> 00:03:30:08
because resistors have colors.

47
00:03:30:21 --> 00:03:33:21
The red, the yellow,

48
00:03:33:21 --> 00:03:37:12
the black, the green because they have a voltage.

49
00:03:38:09 --> 00:03:40:11
We do the math

50
00:03:40:11 --> 00:03:42:17
through colors.

51
00:03:42:17 --> 00:03:44:00
They taught us.

52
00:03:44:00 --> 00:03:47:00
This is a 22k resistor

53
00:03:48:14 --> 00:03:51:02
and I have to search

54
00:03:51:02 --> 00:03:51:20
the little plate

55
00:03:51:20 --> 00:03:54:19
It has its numbering where I have to

56
00:03:55:08 --> 00:03:57:15
put.

57
00:03:57:15 --> 00:03:58:22
Well,

58
00:03:58:22 --> 00:04:02:14
This is a lamp plate.

59
00:04:02:18 --> 00:04:03:15
It's this one here.

60
00:04:05:01 --> 00:04:05:19
I can teach

61
00:04:05:19 --> 00:04:09:03
the boys, just like they taught me and I didn’t know

62
00:04:10:03 --> 00:04:13:15
what voltage, well voltage yes, because I learned

63
00:04:13:15 --> 00:04:16:15
that the numbers, that we have to do the math,

64
00:04:17:13 --> 00:04:18:06
the basics.

65
00:04:18:06 --> 00:04:21:15
I didn't learn that quickly.

66
00:04:22:11 --> 00:04:23:04
Yeah.

67
00:04:23:04 --> 00:04:26:13
So with each one of those you put them together for the other

68
00:04:26:13 --> 00:04:28:00
people from the community?

69
00:04:28:00 --> 00:04:32:11
Yes, of course, because after the course they send us this.

70
00:04:33:03 --> 00:04:36:13
The government has to finance the school

71
00:04:36:13 --> 00:04:38:14
so they can send us the material

72
00:04:38:14 --> 00:04:40:17
and to electrify the community.

73
00:04:40:17 --> 00:04:43:17
“Barefoot school” (Barefoot College) in India,

74
00:04:43:17 --> 00:04:47:18
and this is a PCB plate

75
00:04:48:14 --> 00:04:51:14
of a control that is this one that is here.

76
00:04:52:23 --> 00:04:55:05
This is how they gave it to us like this in India.

77
00:04:55:05 --> 00:04:58:05
“Go set up!”
Do they just send you that?

78
00:04:58:09 --> 00:04:59:22
Yes, they give us this

79
00:04:59:22 --> 00:05:02:02
back in India, that's what I did every day.

80
00:05:03:12 --> 00:05:05:11
To set this up.

81
00:05:05:11 --> 00:05:08:11
The components, they gave us the components, just like this.

82
00:05:09:01 --> 00:05:12:12
So it comes simple like this

83
00:05:12:23 --> 00:05:14:19
and you put everything together?
Yeah.

84
00:05:14:19 --> 00:05:15:23
From the beginning?

85
00:05:15:23 --> 00:05:17:17
From the beginning, from scratch.

86
00:05:17:17 --> 00:05:19:14
Just as it is.

87
00:05:19:14 --> 00:05:22:14
There's the end.

88
00:05:23:03 --> 00:05:26:03
Until it turns on.

89
00:05:26:10 --> 00:05:28:17
This is a control, a loading control

90
00:05:28:17 --> 00:05:32:01
which controls the charge from the solar to the battery so that

91
00:05:33:06 --> 00:05:35:15
it keeps.

92
00:05:35:15 --> 00:05:38:15
Yes, this is a 40 volt charge.

93
00:05:39:17 --> 00:05:41:22
and 10 amperes.

94
00:05:41:22 --> 00:05:43:22
Yeah

95
00:05:43:22 --> 00:05:45:07
This

96
00:05:45:07 --> 00:05:48:07
They asked us. “This name!”,

97
00:05:50:06 --> 00:05:52:11
“This name!” said the teacher

98
00:05:52:11 --> 00:05:54:22
and we repeated what he said first,

99
00:05:54:22 --> 00:05:57:23
“PCB!” first repeated. “PCB!”

100
00:05:59:11 --> 00:06:02:11
And he said “This name?” “PCB!”.

101
00:06:02:22 --> 00:06:07:04
Okay, “Charge Controller!” meaning the control

102
00:06:09:22 --> 00:06:11:04
Do you understand me that English? Or is that English?

103
00:06:12:07 --> 00:06:13:25
Yes, it is! (Laughs)

104
00:06:15:04 --> 00:06:18:02
And that's how we learned it

105
00:06:18:02 --> 00:06:21:02
“Charge Controller!” “This name?”

106
00:06:21:07 --> 00:06:23:20
“PCB!”,

107
00:06:23:20 --> 00:06:26:12
“This name?” “Charge Controller!”

108
00:06:27:11 --> 00:06:30:13
and so then the components

109
00:06:31:14 --> 00:06:34:14
aha, “This name?” in “resistance!”,

110
00:06:34:18 --> 00:06:37:07
Oh, “resistance”

111
00:06:37:07 --> 00:06:39:05
and so on.

112
00:06:39:05 --> 00:06:42:05
We learned each one's name

113
00:06:42:18 --> 00:06:45:13
“This name?” the teacher “This name!”

114
00:06:45:13 --> 00:06:47:08
Yes,

115
00:06:47:08 --> 00:06:49:21
In this organization, what is the importance

116
00:06:49:21 --> 00:06:52:21
that it is women who learn?

117
00:06:52:21 --> 00:06:56:11
Well, it says at school because we are grandmothers,

118
00:06:56:11 --> 00:06:59:11
and we stay in the community

119
00:07:00:06 --> 00:07:03:14
teaching our children or our grandchildren

120
00:07:04:15 --> 00:07:08:00
and that is why the importance of women is

121
00:07:08:16 --> 00:07:11:16
because she is the one who is always in the community

122
00:07:12:17 --> 00:07:15:07
and men don't, they leave,

123
00:07:15:07 --> 00:07:18:05
“Men drink” they said.

124
00:07:18:05 --> 00:07:21:02
That's why it's so important

125
00:07:21:02 --> 00:07:23:08
Elder women,

126
00:07:23:08 --> 00:07:26:07
because if they are young, they also go to the city.

127
00:07:26:15 --> 00:07:30:01
On the other hand, the mothers are grandmothers, and they already stay at home.

128
00:07:30:23 --> 00:07:31:18
That is the importance.

129
00:07:31:18 --> 00:07:33:16
That's what they explained to us in India.

130
00:07:34:22 --> 00:07:36:10
Do you believe in that too?

131
00:07:36:10 --> 00:07:39:02
Yes. Well, that is.

132
00:07:39:02 --> 00:07:40:15
And how does it work?

133
00:07:40:15 --> 00:07:43:15
the solar panel,

134
00:07:43:23 --> 00:07:46:19
goes through what regulator to charge the batteries?

135
00:07:46:19 --> 00:07:48:10
And then when can you use it?

136
00:07:48:10 --> 00:07:51:09
Well, the regulator is this, that is,

137
00:07:52:12 --> 00:07:53:10
is this.

138
00:07:53:10 --> 00:07:58:00
This is the control that regulates the load

139
00:07:59:02 --> 00:08:01:20
from solar to battery.

140
00:08:01:20 --> 00:08:02:17
It keeps it.

141
00:08:02:17 --> 00:08:06:06
It does not burn the battery, but it has already reached its cycle.

142
00:08:06:06 --> 00:08:07:13
Ten years it’s ten years.

143
00:08:07:13 --> 00:08:10:13
There are only five years of lifespan for a battery.

144
00:08:10:18 --> 00:08:13:11
Time has passed,

145
00:08:13:11 --> 00:08:17:02
but when this was given to the community the lights turned on.

146
00:08:17:09 --> 00:08:18:14
Happy, happy.

147
00:08:18:14 --> 00:08:21:14
What happiness!

148
00:08:21:15 --> 00:08:24:07
This is the page

149
00:08:24:07 --> 00:08:26:22
from the school.

150
00:08:26:22 --> 00:08:28:22
You get in there

151
00:08:28:22 --> 00:08:29:09
And that

152
00:08:29:09 --> 00:08:31:12
when the community brought it to me

153
00:08:31:12 --> 00:08:34:12
all this disassembled, burned.

154
00:08:34:15 --> 00:08:34:23
Sure,

155
00:08:34:23 --> 00:08:36:05
I have a spare

156
00:08:36:05 --> 00:08:39:07
because they sent me spare parts from India and I can repair,

157
00:08:41:02 --> 00:08:43:08
give them again.

158
00:08:43:08 --> 00:08:46:14
But if they don't want to make the payment.

159
00:08:47:07 --> 00:08:48:10
Yes. What is the payment?

160
00:08:48:10 --> 00:08:52:21
It's $5,000 pesos a month for maintenance.

161
00:08:53:14 --> 00:08:58:04
If, for example, that battery or this one finished its cycle,

162
00:08:58:16 --> 00:09:01:15
With that cash, with that money,

163
00:09:01:23 --> 00:09:04:09
I can buy the battery,

164
00:09:04:09 --> 00:09:06:23
Go back and turn on the lamp again.

165
00:09:09:10 --> 00:09:12:16
But if the community does not collaborate

166
00:09:13:19 --> 00:09:16:19
with the payment, which is $5,000 pesos per month.

167
00:09:17:12 --> 00:09:20:16
I have told them they can kill a goat and

168
00:09:20:16 --> 00:09:25:02
That goat makes $60,000 a year.

169
00:09:25:21 --> 00:09:28:21
Yes, it's nothing.

170
00:09:31:02 --> 00:09:35:00
But they don't have the money for that, or they don't want to pay?

171
00:09:35:04 --> 00:09:38:18
No, they do have.

172
00:09:40:06 --> 00:09:42:21
But, with just a goat,

173
00:09:42:21 --> 00:09:44:22
one goes and sells that goat,

174
00:09:44:22 --> 00:09:49:00
And it’s 60, annually, it’s 60

175
00:09:51:03 --> 00:09:52:17
is that worth it?

176
00:09:52:17 --> 00:09:54:12
Of course, or even more.

177
00:09:54:12 --> 00:09:57:09
and let's say,

178
00:09:57:09 --> 00:09:59:15
how to give them the importance,

179
00:09:59:15 --> 00:10:01:09
that is, make them realize the importance

180
00:10:01:09 --> 00:10:02:12
of electricity?

181
00:10:02:12 --> 00:10:04:20
Right now they are suffering,
They are?

182
00:10:04:20 --> 00:10:07:17
Yes, they are feeling the suffering

183
00:10:07:17 --> 00:10:10:17
because everyone is off.

184
00:10:11:04 --> 00:10:11:14
Sure thing.

185
00:10:11:14 --> 00:10:14:14
So how to give importance?, come back,

186
00:10:16:04 --> 00:10:17:17
re-electrify.

187
00:10:17:17 --> 00:10:20:23
oh well, fix this again

188
00:10:22:06 --> 00:10:25:10
turn it back on and new batteries.

189
00:10:27:00 --> 00:10:29:05
But here’s a thing,

190
00:10:29:05 --> 00:10:31:08
pay for a year in

191
00:10:31:08 --> 00:10:33:08
advanced, with that money

192
00:10:33:08 --> 00:10:35:05
that which is going to be deposited in a bank.

193
00:10:35:05 --> 00:10:37:13
It's not for me,

194
00:10:37:13 --> 00:10:39:20
It's for the committee, because there is a committee.

195
00:10:39:20 --> 00:10:42:20
I have an association called Azoperro,

196
00:10:45:06 --> 00:10:46:10
I have the association.

197
00:10:46:10 --> 00:10:48:16
And with that association the money is managed?

198
00:10:48:16 --> 00:10:51:16
It is managed, the money is put in

199
00:10:52:12 --> 00:10:55:12
which is maintenance and which is not for me.

200
00:10:56:11 --> 00:10:58:16
And let's say, I see that you have there

201
00:10:59:21 --> 00:11:01:08
television?

202
00:11:01:08 --> 00:11:04:07
Before it turned on.
Did it turn on before?

203
00:11:04:15 --> 00:11:07:20
It had Direct TV, it had wi -fi

204
00:11:09:12 --> 00:11:11:11
Also my battery is already dead,

205
00:11:11:11 --> 00:11:14:11
but I think and think about it a lot,

206
00:11:14:19 --> 00:11:17:19
I have to replace it,

207
00:11:18:07 --> 00:11:19:12
I'm going to replace it.

208
00:11:19:12 --> 00:11:21:04
and where do you get the materials for that?

209
00:11:21:04 --> 00:11:23:02
There, there

210
00:11:23:02 --> 00:11:25:05
It is also sold in Uribia.

211
00:11:25:05 --> 00:11:28:13
That's worth it, it's worth like every battery from that big one

212
00:11:28:13 --> 00:11:31:13
It's costing like a million pesos.

213
00:11:31:19 --> 00:11:34:19
Umm , yes a million pesos.

214
00:11:35:10 --> 00:11:37:18
There are three large batteries

215
00:11:37:18 --> 00:11:41:03
so that I can turn my workshop back on, because sometimes

216
00:11:41:07 --> 00:11:44:07
I start to repair,

217
00:11:44:18 --> 00:11:46:07
I concentrate.

218
00:11:46:07 --> 00:11:51:07
Yes, I have, I don't like knitting, I don't like knitting.

219
00:11:51:07 --> 00:11:53:14
I don't like it, I don't have patience.

220
00:11:53:14 --> 00:11:55:15
Do you love electronics?

221
00:11:55:15 --> 00:11:57:12
It's the one I like the most, it entertains me.

222
00:11:57:12 --> 00:12:00:12
Yes, yes, I like it better.

223
00:12:01:00 --> 00:12:03:20
Let's say, a project, but it's not like

224
00:12:03:20 --> 00:12:04:18
individual, but

225
00:12:06:13 --> 00:12:08:09
solar panels, but much bigger

226
00:12:08:09 --> 00:12:10:09
to electrify

227
00:12:10:09 --> 00:12:14:02
everything, is that something you have thought about, thinking about how to make it bigger?

228
00:12:14:02 --> 00:12:15:16
Not like each house has its own,

229
00:12:15:16 --> 00:12:19:04
but to enlarge the project and make it like one?

230
00:12:19:08 --> 00:12:22:08
They have done census here, they say...

231
00:12:22:17 --> 00:12:25:05
that they are going to electrify

232
00:12:25:05 --> 00:12:28:05
the entire Upper guajira with large solar panels,

233
00:12:29:04 --> 00:12:33:03
to turn on a refrigerator, I don't know, but that takes a while.

234
00:12:33:03 --> 00:12:36:03
That's what I'm waiting for. Hopefully.

235
00:12:36:12 --> 00:12:39:12
You can lead the project.

236
00:12:39:16 --> 00:12:41:11
Yes, that's what they told me,

237
00:12:41:11 --> 00:12:44:11
but I don't know how to wait.

238
00:12:44:14 --> 00:12:47:14
The companies that are here, Helios.

239
00:12:50:09 --> 00:12:51:05
Tell us a little more

240
00:12:51:05 --> 00:12:54:05
from the school they want to open

241
00:12:54:07 --> 00:12:56:17
where they want you to be a teacher.

242
00:12:56:17 --> 00:12:57:19
What is it about?

243
00:12:57:19 --> 00:13:00:19
That's there in Cabo de la Vela.

244
00:13:01:03 --> 00:13:03:05
Well they want to do

245
00:13:03:05 --> 00:13:05:17
that project there like in India,

246
00:13:05:17 --> 00:13:08:13
that women learn to

247
00:13:08:13 --> 00:13:13:12
repair their own equipment for maintenance,

248
00:13:13:12 --> 00:13:16:06
because it is going to be electrified

249
00:13:16:06 --> 00:13:19:06
in that area due to the wind zone.

250
00:13:19:06 --> 00:13:21:12
That's what I understand.

251
00:13:21:12 --> 00:13:23:13
They told me like this.

252
00:13:23:13 --> 00:13:26:22
So they are going to hire me to teach. “This name?”

253
00:13:33:00 --> 00:13:36:11
I don't know if they are going to bring the material from India, I don't know,

254
00:13:36:23 --> 00:13:38:08
Until now, I don’t.

255
00:13:38:08 --> 00:13:42:02
But is it in association with them or do they want to do it separately?

256
00:13:42:13 --> 00:13:45:13
Apart, yes apart.

257
00:13:46:06 --> 00:13:47:10
They are on it,

258
00:13:47:10 --> 00:13:50:10
They are already communicating with the school.

259
00:13:52:10 --> 00:13:55:08
and they are going to bring a teacher from India

260
00:13:55:08 --> 00:13:59:07
In order to reinforce.
Sure to reinforce.

261
00:13:59:09 --> 00:14:00:15
Yeah

262
00:14:00:15 --> 00:14:02:22
and let's say there are no initiatives for that here,

263
00:14:02:22 --> 00:14:05:22
I mean, like he's a teacher from here?

264
00:14:06:09 --> 00:14:09:10
I don't know, I think so, of course, there must be,

265
00:14:10:09 --> 00:14:12:14
but they want to bring it like in India.

266
00:14:12:14 --> 00:14:14:12
Because do they learn like this

267
00:14:14:12 --> 00:14:17:12
illiterate, semi-literate.

268
00:14:17:17 --> 00:14:20:23
It is a strategy that they have to

269
00:14:21:15 --> 00:14:24:15
learn.

270
00:14:27:09 --> 00:14:28:23
Are you

271
00:14:28:23 --> 00:14:32:05
an electrical engineer?

272
00:14:33:01 --> 00:14:34:12
We set this up there.

273
00:14:35:13 --> 00:14:36:13
It's very impressive.

274
00:14:36:13 --> 00:14:39:14
I don't know about that, it seems very complicated.

275
00:14:39:15 --> 00:14:40:12
Me too.

276
00:14:40:12 --> 00:14:43:12
I said on the plane, what am I going to know about mathematics?

277
00:14:43:13 --> 00:14:44:16
I did not know anything.

278
00:14:44:16 --> 00:14:46:07
But you learned to weld and everything.

279
00:14:46:07 --> 00:14:47:13
Yes of course.

280
00:14:47:13 --> 00:14:50:12
Here I do it, easily.

281
00:14:50:12 --> 00:14:51:04
I weld.

282
00:14:51:04 --> 00:14:52:18
I grab here and there.

283
00:14:52:18 --> 00:14:53:00
This

284
00:14:53:00 --> 00:14:56:00
So

285
00:14:56:00 --> 00:14:59:15
I have practiced that already.

286
00:14:59:19 --> 00:15:01:00
and do you have the iron, the solder?

287
00:15:01:00 --> 00:15:03:09
I have everything, everything, everything, everything, everything.

288
00:15:04:10 --> 00:15:07:03
And how could you weld if there is no power?

289
00:15:07:03 --> 00:15:11:16
There isn’t because my batteries have already arrived to their lifespan too.

290
00:15:11:17 --> 00:15:14:17
They no longer heat up during the cycle.

291
00:15:16:01 --> 00:15:16:19
Yeah.

292
00:15:16:19 --> 00:15:21:02
Would receiving more batteries mean receiving that payment from the communities?

293
00:15:21:03 --> 00:15:23:00
Yeah.

294
00:15:23:00 --> 00:15:23:23
Yes of course.

295
00:15:23:23 --> 00:15:26:23
They have to each one.

296
00:15:27:01 --> 00:15:29:20
It costs 1 million pesos every five years,

297
00:15:29:20 --> 00:15:31:08
well, you can surely save a million pesos in five years.

298
00:15:31:08 --> 00:15:32:22
Yes of course.

299
00:15:32:22 --> 00:15:36:00
75 communities, or people?

300
00:15:36:00 --> 00:15:39:10
75 families, in Macuira too.

301
00:15:40:03 --> 00:15:40:15
And here.

302
00:15:42:22 --> 00:15:44:08
Yes, in Macuira.

303
00:15:44:08 --> 00:15:45:00
And can you pass us the book?

304
00:15:45:00 --> 00:15:48:00
The book?

305
00:15:48:01 --> 00:15:49:23
Is the same.

306
00:15:49:23 --> 00:15:51:20
Did you learn

307
00:15:51:20 --> 00:15:53:15
in English then?

308
00:15:53:15 --> 00:15:56:15
No, I wish I learned English.

309
00:15:57:11 --> 00:15:59:18
Here it is

310
00:15:59:18 --> 00:16:02:16
I have all these tools, I have them all.

311
00:16:02:16 --> 00:16:05:07
Yes, but the book is not in Spanish.

312
00:16:05:07 --> 00:16:07:22
No, I have brought translated

313
00:16:07:22 --> 00:16:10:22
some when I had wifi, I started translating.

314
00:16:11:15 --> 00:16:13:17
I translated some of them

315
00:16:13:17 --> 00:16:15:23
because

316
00:16:15:23 --> 00:16:20:00
I want to know what this is called in Spanish and I

317
00:16:20:00 --> 00:16:23:11
I learned it was just (in English). Here are them all, the resistances,

318
00:16:24:15 --> 00:16:26:15
of how many,

319
00:16:26:15 --> 00:16:28:13
all these little things.

320
00:16:28:13 --> 00:16:31:13
[Interviewers,

321
00:16:32:12 --> 00:16:34:08
let's say, since it was like 10 years ago,

322
00:16:34:08 --> 00:16:36:01
with the updates of technology,

323
00:16:36:01 --> 00:16:38:15
do you think there will be new ways to do it?

324
00:16:38:15 --> 00:16:40:20
Ah, I think that already in India, at school,

325
00:16:40:20 --> 00:16:42:02
I saw, I get in

326
00:16:42:02 --> 00:16:45:04
always on the page, I see that they are more different.

327
00:16:45:08 --> 00:16:47:21
Yes, they are back and lamp.

328
00:16:47:21 --> 00:16:50:06
Then you should get technical.

329
00:16:50:06 --> 00:16:51:23
Become even more expert.
Clear

330
00:16:53:00 --> 00:16:56:00
That's what we want

331
00:16:56:04 --> 00:16:57:23
So we send you back to India?

332
00:16:57:23 --> 00:17:00:14
Yeah,

333
00:17:00:14 --> 00:17:02:07
or right here.

334
00:17:02:07 --> 00:17:03:16
There’s no need.

335
00:17:03:16 --> 00:17:08:03
Is it possible right here?
Of course you can.

336
00:17:09:01 --> 00:17:09:08
Look

337
00:17:09:08 --> 00:17:12:00
the colors that I learned every day they taught us.

338
00:17:12:00 --> 00:17:14:12
I said why do we learn that color, I already know black,

339
00:17:14:12 --> 00:17:16:08
I already know the brown, I know the red.

340
00:17:16:08 --> 00:17:19:19
We didn't understand why they taught us colors every day,

341
00:17:20:20 --> 00:17:21:17
the numbers.

342
00:17:21:17 --> 00:17:24:12
Do you know how much a thousand volts is in colors?

343
00:17:24:12 --> 00:17:26:13
thousand volts

344
00:17:26:13 --> 00:17:32:05
It is a black and 000 that is the black, black, black.

345
00:17:33:02 --> 00:17:37:04
I took courses on this, I also know how to put them together,

346
00:17:37:16 --> 00:17:40:20
but then also the same thing.

347
00:17:40:20 --> 00:17:43:09
I knew them.

348
00:17:43:09 --> 00:17:44:19
AHA. I said in India, for what?

349
00:17:44:19 --> 00:17:46:05
If I already know the black,

350
00:17:46:05 --> 00:17:49:05
I already know red and I know, we didn't understand, because

351
00:17:49:16 --> 00:17:54:08
when they taught us resistance, Ah! It’s the resistance,

352
00:17:54:08 --> 00:17:58:00
So this was not for the semi-literate either.

353
00:17:58:02 --> 00:18:01:11
You also have to look at mathematics.

354
00:18:02:13 --> 00:18:04:09
Yes, but then they taught you…

355
00:18:04:09 --> 00:18:07:09
Here and here, for example, one does the math, here it is.

356
00:18:08:05 --> 00:18:10:13
And did they teach you to draw then

357
00:18:10:13 --> 00:18:12:21
how much voltage is there?

358
00:18:12:21 --> 00:18:16:01
If there is that much voltage, how much resistance is there?

359
00:18:17:00 --> 00:18:20:00
like in math and like amperage times voltage.

360
00:18:20:09 --> 00:18:22:12
Yes, but a little.

361
00:18:22:12 --> 00:18:25:12
I learned those amperes.

362
00:18:26:00 --> 00:18:26:23
Sure.

363
00:18:26:23 --> 00:18:28:19
Here it is, go,

364
00:18:28:19 --> 00:18:31:18
the volts, do the math.

365
00:18:31:18 --> 00:18:34:18
I already learned this

366
00:18:35:15 --> 00:18:37:10
and I said oh no,

367
00:18:37:10 --> 00:18:40:10
because they said it was for illiterate people,

368
00:18:40:18 --> 00:18:43:01
which is not so much for the illiterate,

369
00:18:43:01 --> 00:18:46:01
I said when they showed me these numbers.

370
00:18:46:19 --> 00:18:47:23
But did you know how to read?

371
00:18:47:23 --> 00:18:50:23
Of course, I am

372
00:18:51:06 --> 00:18:54:06
high school.

373
00:18:55:21 --> 00:18:58:21
My grandmother has been in second grade.

374
00:18:59:15 --> 00:19:02:15
There were women until they reached second grade.

375
00:19:03:19 --> 00:19:05:02
and they learned.

376
00:19:05:02 --> 00:19:08:02
They learned hard but cool.

377
00:19:08:05 --> 00:19:09:15
Yeah.

378
00:19:09:15 --> 00:19:11:23
These are my teachers.

379
00:19:11:23 --> 00:19:13:10
Look how cute.

380
00:19:14:19 --> 00:19:17:00
I knew all this.

381
00:19:17:00 --> 00:19:20:00
This is Teacher Magan.

382
00:19:20:18 --> 00:19:22:18
They dressed us as Hindu.

383
00:19:22:18 --> 00:19:25:01
Yes, she does, she is very cool,

384
00:19:25:01 --> 00:19:27:02
He lent us his things, he dressed us as Hindu.

385
00:19:27:02 --> 00:19:30:02
I have photos of me dressed as Hindu.

386
00:19:31:14 --> 00:19:34:14
These are the teachers.

387
00:19:35:01 --> 00:19:36:11
This is a man who

388
00:19:36:11 --> 00:19:39:11
uses crutches.

389
00:19:39:14 --> 00:19:41:23
Yes Yes Yes.

390
00:19:41:23 --> 00:19:44:23
Teacher Umán is cooler.

391
00:19:45:01 --> 00:19:47:05
“Teacher, Problem?”

392
00:19:47:05 --> 00:19:49:15
No.

393
00:19:49:15 --> 00:19:50:13
No problem.

394
00:19:50:13 --> 00:19:51:20
No problem , he told me.

395
00:19:51:20 --> 00:19:54:19
With that, with that patience,

396
00:19:55:23 --> 00:19:58:23
It was with him that we learned the most.

397
00:19:59:02 --> 00:20:03:01
We said every day, women, “teacher problem!”.

398
00:20:03:18 --> 00:20:06:07
I mean, as it is, I don't learn, I don't know.

399
00:20:06:07 --> 00:20:09:07
And he said no problem , no problem .

400
00:20:09:23 --> 00:20:10:18
He was so cool.

401
00:20:10:18 --> 00:20:12:21
Him,

402
00:20:12:21 --> 00:20:15:21
But more than all he and this one.

403
00:20:16:00 --> 00:20:17:15
He,

404
00:20:17:15 --> 00:20:19:15
who was my teacher too,

405
00:20:19:15 --> 00:20:21:15
I think he is the one who is going to come.

406
00:20:21:15 --> 00:20:24:21
Um , he was in Guatemala and has formed a school

407
00:20:24:21 --> 00:20:27:02
in Guatemala with Rodrigo Paris.

408
00:20:28:16 --> 00:20:30:19
Do you know when he's coming or when it is?

409
00:20:30:19 --> 00:20:32:13
When school is here, they told me.

410
00:20:32:13 --> 00:20:35:13
And who is organizing the school thing?

411
00:20:37:02 --> 00:20:40:08
The People of Ipse .

412
00:20:42:06 --> 00:20:45:08
That now with Petro and him

413
00:20:46:02 --> 00:20:49:02
They are with Ecopetrol,

414
00:20:49:18 --> 00:20:51:22
they are going to finance

415
00:20:51:22 --> 00:20:54:11
and I think this is the one that's going to come.

416
00:20:54:11 --> 00:20:56:20
I don't know,

417
00:20:56:20 --> 00:20:59:20
He told me like this, all of these are teachers.

418
00:21:00:16 --> 00:21:02:15
This is a little different topic,

419
00:21:02:15 --> 00:21:05:19
but what changes have you seen in the environment?

420
00:21:05:20 --> 00:21:06:20
Here?
here.

421
00:21:06:20 --> 00:21:09:20
Well, at the beginning there was a change, of course,

422
00:21:10:20 --> 00:21:13:12
there was joy because

423
00:21:13:12 --> 00:21:16:07
People could charge their cell phones.

424
00:21:16:07 --> 00:21:19:07
The children studied at night, did homework,

425
00:21:20:12 --> 00:21:21:10
I think they're back

426
00:21:21:10 --> 00:21:24:09
the same as before and it makes me sad

427
00:21:24:09 --> 00:21:25:00
sometimes.

428
00:21:25:00 --> 00:21:27:20
That's when they invite me and say

429
00:21:27:20 --> 00:21:31:04
What is the progress? how it moves forward if that is backwards

430
00:21:33:01 --> 00:21:36:01
and it’s embarrassing for me to say that

431
00:21:36:08 --> 00:21:37:03
let's say

432
00:21:37:03 --> 00:21:40:13
because children study and that is not known

433
00:21:40:13 --> 00:21:42:10
have put in the effort to say well then

434
00:21:42:10 --> 00:21:43:23
is that they are no longer studying,

435
00:21:43:23 --> 00:21:46:07
I can't charge my cell phone anymore, like they haven't said how

436
00:21:46:07 --> 00:21:49:17
please take and buy me a battery, fix it .

437
00:21:51:23 --> 00:21:54:05
No, nobody,

438
00:21:54:05 --> 00:21:55:12
but that is the commitment.

439
00:21:55:12 --> 00:21:58:17
If any organization arrives

440
00:21:59:12 --> 00:22:02:12
to provide us with the battery, that's what I plan to do,

441
00:22:03:02 --> 00:22:05:19
In other words, get the family involved

442
00:22:05:19 --> 00:22:08:19
that has to advance

443
00:22:09:13 --> 00:22:11:03
money

444
00:22:11:03 --> 00:22:14:03
and we electrify them, if they don’t want to,

445
00:22:14:08 --> 00:22:16:19
It is not electrified.

446
00:22:16:19 --> 00:22:18:17
But is that

447
00:22:18:17 --> 00:22:21:17
It is something very small, but it shines.

448
00:22:21:20 --> 00:22:24:19
This little light shines a lot at night,

449
00:22:24:19 --> 00:22:27:09
There are four for each family,

450
00:22:27:09 --> 00:22:30:09
One here in the kitchen, on the bed inside

451
00:22:31:13 --> 00:22:33:21
and lasts all night.

452
00:22:33:21 --> 00:22:35:18
And does it charge every day?

453
00:22:35:18 --> 00:22:36:16
Every day.

454
00:22:40:15 --> 00:22:41:06
This is the,

455
00:22:41:06 --> 00:22:44:06
here it connects,

456
00:22:44:18 --> 00:22:47:1
here we connect the,

457
00:22:48:03 --> 00:22:51:03
we make the connection here,

458
00:22:51:15 --> 00:22:54:07
here we connect,

459
00:22:54:07 --> 00:22:56:13
We connect here.

460
00:22:56:13 --> 00:22:59:13
This is the positive and negative.

461
00:23:25:06 --> 00:23:26:23
Well then

462
00:23:26:23 --> 00:23:29:22
here the panels are connected,

463
00:23:30:06 --> 00:23:33:06
positive-negative solar panels

464
00:23:34:01 --> 00:23:36:00
Battery.

465
00:23:36:00 --> 00:23:36:21
We connect here.

466
00:23:36:21 --> 00:23:39:21
This is for the lamps

467
00:23:40:00 --> 00:23:41:17
in the four lamp.

468
00:23:41:17 --> 00:23:45:01
Have you never shorted by mistake?

469
00:23:45:07 --> 00:23:46:04
Didn't it short out or burn?

470
00:23:46:04 --> 00:23:49:09
No, because you have to be very careful that one

471
00:23:49:09 --> 00:23:52:23
do not connect the positive to the negative

472
00:23:53:01 --> 00:23:57:08
If any of the resistors is shorted or burned

473
00:23:57:14 --> 00:24:00:14
Ever

And how do you know when they are burned?

474
00:24:00:19 --> 00:24:03:03
With the,

475
00:24:03:03 --> 00:24:06:03
with the... what's his name, the tester

476
00:24:06:08 --> 00:24:08:12
Oh, do you have a tester ?
Yes too.

477
00:24:08:12 --> 00:24:09:21
Do you have a multimeter too?

478
00:24:09:21 --> 00:24:12:21
Yeah.
You have everything.

479
00:24:13:07 --> 00:24:15:19
With that I

480
00:24:15:19 --> 00:24:18:15
I realize.
