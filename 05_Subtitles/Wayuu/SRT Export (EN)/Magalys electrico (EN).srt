1
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,625
Can you explain what you are doing?

2
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,625
This is a portable lamp.

3
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,666
A Solar LED lamp

4
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:19,083
Well this is what we did

5
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:22,625
in India.

6
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:25,666
I can put together this plate,

7
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:29,916
but since the batteries are already there.

8
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,666
With this lot,

9
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:35,666
this lamp charges

10
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,833
From the sunlight,

11
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,791
This one is 10 volts.

12
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,583
Yeah,

13
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,916
10 volts and 7 amperes

14
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:55,958
I,

15
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,958
From India I learned to assemble.

16
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,250
This is the plate of this lamp

17
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,833
that I can put together myself.

18
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,416
These are the components.

19
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:11,416
These are the components.

20
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,625
Yes, they are the components.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,541
Here are the resistors.

22
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,125
These are resistors.

23
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:23,125
These are,

24
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,125
resistors.

25
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,708
These are the

26
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,375
AISI.

27
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,208
The diodes, the

28
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:35,166
capacitors that are diodes.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,250
This is an offer .

30
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,333
This is a transformer, a capacitor.

31
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,916
This is another capacitor.

32
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,791
This is a

33
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,208
I knew this

34
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,125
and I learned that there.

35
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:54,125
These are the components of this plate.

36
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,625
I can put this together

37
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:59,625
and I have my book, through the book it was

38
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,458
that I learned to put together

39
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,916
each component.

40
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,916
If I don't set this up well, it doesn't turn on.

41
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,041
But through this

42
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,583
I repeated it every day, the teacher would tell us

43
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,125
that a resistance of

44
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,625
R22.

45
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,500
Well, they taught us colors

46
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,541
because resistors have colors.

47
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:34,083
The red, the yellow,

48
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:37,708
the black, the green because they have a voltage.

49
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,666
We do the math

50
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,916
through colors.

51
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,208
They taught us.

52
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,208
This is a 22k resistor

53
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,291
and I have to search

54
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,041
the little plate

55
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:55,000
It has its numbering where I have to

56
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,833
put.

57
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,125
Well,

58
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,791
This is a lamp plate.

59
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:03,833
It's this one here.

60
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,000
I can teach

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,333
the boys, just like they taught me and I didn’t know

62
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,875
what voltage, well voltage yes, because I learned

63
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,875
that the numbers, that we have to do the math,

64
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,500
the basics.

65
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,875
I didn't learn that quickly.

66
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,416
Yeah.

67
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,791
So with each one of those you put them together for the other

68
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,250
people from the community?

69
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,708
Yes, of course, because after the course they send us this.

70
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,791
The government has to finance the school

71
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,833
so they can send us the material

72
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,958
and to electrify the community.

73
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,958
“Barefoot school” (Barefoot College) in India,

74
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:48,000
and this is a PCB plate

75
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,875
of a control that is this one that is here.

76
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,500
This is how they gave it to us like this in India.

77
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,500
“Go set up!”
Do they just send you that?

78
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,208
Yes, they give us this

79
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,375
back in India, that's what I did every day.

80
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,750
To set this up.

81
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,750
The components, they gave us the components, just like this.

82
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,791
So it comes simple like this

83
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,083
and you put everything together?
Yeah.

84
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,250
From the beginning?

85
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,000
From the beginning, from scratch.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,875
Just as it is.

87
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,875
There's the end.

88
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,416
Until it turns on.

89
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,000
This is a control, a loading control

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,333
which controls the charge from the solar to the battery so that

91
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,958
it keeps.

92
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,958
Yes, this is a 40 volt charge.

93
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,250
and 10 amperes.

94
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,250
Yeah

95
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,625
This

96
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,625
They asked us. “This name!”,

97
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,791
“This name!” said the teacher

98
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,250
and we repeated what he said first,

99
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,291
“PCB!” first repeated. “PCB!”

100
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,791
And he said “This name?” “PCB!”.

101
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,500
Okay, “Charge Controller!” meaning the control

102
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,500
Do you understand me that English? Or is that English?

103
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,375
Yes, it is! (Laughs)

104
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,458
And that's how we learned it

105
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,458
“Charge Controller!” “This name?”

106
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,208
“PCB!”,

107
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,875
“This name?” “Charge Controller!”

108
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,916
and so then the components

109
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,958
aha, “This name?” in “resistance!”,

110
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,666
Oh, “resistance”

111
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,583
and so on.

112
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,583
We learned each one's name

113
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,916
“This name?” the teacher “This name!”

114
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,708
Yes,

115
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,250
In this organization, what is the importance

116
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,250
that it is women who learn?

117
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,875
Well, it says at school because we are grandmothers,

118
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,875
and we stay in the community

119
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:04,000
teaching our children or our grandchildren

120
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:08,416
and that is why the importance of women is

121
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,083
because she is the one who is always in the community

122
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,708
and men don't, they leave,

123
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,625
“Men drink” they said.

124
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,500
That's why it's so important

125
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,750
Elder women,

126
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,708
because if they are young, they also go to the city.

127
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,458
On the other hand, the mothers are grandmothers, and they already stay at home.

128
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,166
That is the importance.

129
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,083
That's what they explained to us in India.

130
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,833
Do you believe in that too?

131
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,541
Yes. Well, that is.

132
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,083
And how does it work?

133
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,083
the solar panel,

134
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:47,250
goes through what regulator to charge the batteries?

135
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,875
And then when can you use it?

136
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,833
Well, the regulator is this, that is,

137
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:53,875
is this.

138
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:58,458
This is the control that regulates the load

139
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,291
from solar to battery.

140
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,166
It keeps it.

141
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,708
It does not burn the battery, but it has already reached its cycle.

142
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,000
Ten years it’s ten years.

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
There are only five years of lifespan for a battery.

144
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,916
Time has passed,

145
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:17,541
but when this was given to the community the lights turned on.

146
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,041
Happy, happy.

147
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,083
What happiness!

148
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,791
This is the page

149
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,416
from the school.

150
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,416
You get in there

151
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:29,875
And that

152
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,000
when the community brought it to me

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
all this disassembled, burned.

154
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:35,458
Sure,

155
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,708
I have a spare

156
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,791
because they sent me spare parts from India and I can repair,

157
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,833
give them again.

158
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:47,083
But if they don't want to make the payment.

159
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:48,916
Yes. What is the payment?

160
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:53,375
It's $5,000 pesos a month for maintenance.

161
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:58,666
If, for example, that battery or this one finished its cycle,

162
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:02,166
With that cash, with that money,

163
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,916
I can buy the battery,

164
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,500
Go back and turn on the lamp again.

165
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:13,208
But if the community does not collaborate

166
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,333
with the payment, which is $5,000 pesos per month.

167
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:21,208
I have told them they can kill a goat and

168
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:25,625
That goat makes $60,000 a year.

169
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,416
Yes, it's nothing.

170
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:35,541
But they don't have the money for that, or they don't want to pay?

171
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,291
No, they do have.

172
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,458
But, with just a goat,

173
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,500
one goes and sells that goat,

174
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,583
And it’s 60, annually, it’s 60

175
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,291
is that worth it?

176
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,083
Of course, or even more.

177
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,958
and let's say,

178
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,208
how to give them the importance,

179
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,958
that is, make them realize the importance

180
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,083
of electricity?

181
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,416
Right now they are suffering,
They are?

182
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,291
Yes, they are feeling the suffering

183
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:11,291
because everyone is off.

184
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,166
Sure thing.

185
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,166
So how to give importance?, come back,

186
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,291
re-electrify.

187
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,541
oh well, fix this again

188
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:26,041
turn it back on and new batteries.

189
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,833
But here’s a thing,

190
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,958
pay for a year in

191
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,958
advanced, with that money

192
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,833
that which is going to be deposited in a bank.

193
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,166
It's not for me,

194
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,458
It's for the committee, because there is a committee.

195
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,458
I have an association called Azoperro,

196
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,041
I have the association.

197
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,291
And with that association the money is managed?

198
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,291
It is managed, the money is put in

199
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,125
which is maintenance and which is not for me.

200
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,291
And let's say, I see that you have there

201
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,958
television?

202
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,916
Before it turned on.
Did it turn on before?

203
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,500
It had Direct TV, it had wi -fi

204
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,125
Also my battery is already dead,

205
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,125
but I think and think about it a lot,

206
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,458
I have to replace it,

207
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,166
I'm going to replace it.

208
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,833
and where do you get the materials for that?

209
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,750
There, there

210
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,875
It is also sold in Uribia.

211
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:29,208
That's worth it, it's worth like every battery from that big one

212
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,208
It's costing like a million pesos.

213
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,458
Umm , yes a million pesos.

214
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,416
There are three large batteries

215
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,791
so that I can turn my workshop back on, because sometimes

216
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,958
I start to repair,

217
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,958
I concentrate.

218
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:52,000
Yes, I have, I don't like knitting, I don't like knitting.

219
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,291
I don't like it, I don't have patience.

220
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,333
Do you love electronics?

221
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,208
It's the one I like the most, it entertains me.

222
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:01,208
Yes, yes, I like it better.

223
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,541
Let's say, a project, but it's not like

224
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,458
individual, but

225
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,083
solar panels, but much bigger

226
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,083
to electrify

227
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:14,791
everything, is that something you have thought about, thinking about how to make it bigger?

228
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,375
Not like each house has its own,

229
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,875
but to enlarge the project and make it like one?

230
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,041
They have done census here, they say...

231
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,916
that they are going to electrify

232
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,916
the entire Upper guajira with large solar panels,

233
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,875
to turn on a refrigerator, I don't know, but that takes a while.

234
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,875
That's what I'm waiting for. Hopefully.

235
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,250
You can lead the project.

236
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,208
Yes, that's what they told me,

237
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:45,208
but I don't know how to wait.

238
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,333
The companies that are here, Helios.

239
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:51,958
Tell us a little more

240
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,958
from the school they want to open

241
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,458
where they want you to be a teacher.

242
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,541
What is it about?

243
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,541
That's there in Cabo de la Vela.

244
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,958
Well they want to do

245
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,458
that project there like in India,

246
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,291
that women learn to

247
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:14,291
repair their own equipment for maintenance,

248
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:17,041
because it is going to be electrified

249
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,041
in that area due to the wind zone.

250
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,291
That's what I understand.

251
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,333
They told me like this.

252
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,708
So they are going to hire me to teach. “This name?”

253
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:37,250
I don't know if they are going to bring the material from India, I don't know,

254
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,125
Until now, I don’t.

255
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:42,875
But is it in association with them or do they want to do it separately?

256
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,333
Apart, yes apart.

257
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,208
They are on it,

258
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,208
They are already communicating with the school.

259
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,166
and they are going to bring a teacher from India

260
00:13:56,166 --> 00:14:00,125
In order to reinforce.
Sure to reinforce.

261
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,458
Yeah

262
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,750
and let's say there are no initiatives for that here,

263
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,750
I mean, like he's a teacher from here?

264
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,250
I don't know, I think so, of course, there must be,

265
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,416
but they want to bring it like in India.

266
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,333
Because do they learn like this

267
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,333
illiterate, semi-literate.

268
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,791
It is a strategy that they have to

269
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,458
learn.

270
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,791
Are you

271
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:33,041
an electrical engineer?

272
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,375
We set this up there.

273
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,416
It's very impressive.

274
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:40,458
I don't know about that, it seems very complicated.

275
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,375
Me too.

276
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,375
I said on the plane, what am I going to know about mathematics?

277
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,541
I did not know anything.

278
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,166
But you learned to weld and everything.

279
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,416
Yes of course.

280
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,375
Here I do it, easily.

281
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,041
I weld.

282
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,625
I grab here and there.

283
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:53,875
This

284
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,875
So

285
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:00,500
I have practiced that already.

286
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,875
and do you have the iron, the solder?

287
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,250
I have everything, everything, everything, everything, everything.

288
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,000
And how could you weld if there is no power?

289
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,541
There isn’t because my batteries have already arrived to their lifespan too.

290
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,583
They no longer heat up during the cycle.

291
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:17,708
Yeah.

292
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:22,000
Would receiving more batteries mean receiving that payment from the communities?

293
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,916
Yeah.

294
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:24,875
Yes of course.

295
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,875
They have to each one.

296
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,750
It costs 1 million pesos every five years,

297
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,250
well, you can surely save a million pesos in five years.

298
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,833
Yes of course.

299
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,916
75 communities, or people?

300
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:40,333
75 families, in Macuira too.

301
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:41,541
And here.

302
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,250
Yes, in Macuira.

303
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:45,916
And can you pass us the book?

304
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,916
The book?

305
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,875
Is the same.

306
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,750
Did you learn

307
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,541
in English then?

308
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,541
No, I wish I learned English.

309
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,708
Here it is

310
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,625
I have all these tools, I have them all.

311
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,250
Yes, but the book is not in Spanish.

312
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,875
No, I have brought translated

313
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,875
some when I had wifi, I started translating.

314
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,666
I translated some of them

315
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,916
because

316
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:20,958
I want to know what this is called in Spanish and I

317
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,416
I learned it was just (in English). Here are them all, the resistances,

318
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,583
of how many,

319
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,500
all these little things.

320
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,500
[Interviewers,

321
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,291
let's say, since it was like 10 years ago,

322
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,000
with the updates of technology,

323
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,583
do you think there will be new ways to do it?

324
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,833
Ah, I think that already in India, at school,

325
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,083
I saw, I get in

326
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:46,166
always on the page, I see that they are more different.

327
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,875
Yes, they are back and lamp.

328
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,250
Then you should get technical.

329
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,958
Become even more expert.
Clear

330
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That's what we want

331
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,958
So we send you back to India?

332
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,583
Yeah,

333
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,291
or right here.

334
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,666
There’s no need.

335
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:09,125
Is it possible right here?
Of course you can.

336
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:10,333
Look

337
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,000
the colors that I learned every day they taught us.

338
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,500
I said why do we learn that color, I already know black,

339
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,333
I already know the brown, I know the red.

340
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,791
We didn't understand why they taught us colors every day,

341
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,750
the numbers.

342
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,541
Do you know how much a thousand volts is in colors?

343
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,583
thousand volts

344
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:33,250
It is a black and 000 that is the black, black, black.

345
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:38,208
I took courses on this, I also know how to put them together,

346
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,875
but then also the same thing.

347
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,416
I knew them.

348
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:45,833
AHA. I said in India, for what?

349
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,250
If I already know the black,

350
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,250
I already know red and I know, we didn't understand, because

351
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:55,375
when they taught us resistance, Ah! It’s the resistance,

352
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:59,041
So this was not for the semi-literate either.

353
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,500
You also have to look at mathematics.

354
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,458
Yes, but then they taught you…

355
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,458
Here and here, for example, one does the math, here it is.

356
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,625
And did they teach you to draw then

357
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,958
how much voltage is there?

358
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:17,125
If there is that much voltage, how much resistance is there?

359
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:21,083
like in math and like amperage times voltage.

360
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,583
Yes, but a little.

361
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,583
I learned those amperes.

362
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,041
Sure.

363
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,875
Here it is, go,

364
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,833
the volts, do the math.

365
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,833
I already learned this

366
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,500
and I said oh no,

367
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,500
because they said it was for illiterate people,

368
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,125
which is not so much for the illiterate,

369
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:47,166
I said when they showed me these numbers.

370
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,083
But did you know how to read?

371
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:52,083
Of course, I am

372
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,375
high school.

373
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
My grandmother has been in second grade.

374
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,750
There were women until they reached second grade.

375
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,208
and they learned.

376
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:09,208
They learned hard but cool.

377
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,750
Yeah.

378
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,083
These are my teachers.

379
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,541
Look how cute.

380
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,125
I knew all this.

381
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,125
This is Teacher Magan.

382
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,875
They dressed us as Hindu.

383
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,166
Yes, she does, she is very cool,

384
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,250
He lent us his things, he dressed us as Hindu.

385
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,250
I have photos of me dressed as Hindu.

386
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,750
These are the teachers.

387
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,625
This is a man who

388
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,625
uses crutches.

389
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,125
Yes Yes Yes.

390
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:46,125
Teacher Umán is cooler.

391
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,375
“Teacher, Problem?”

392
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,791
No.

393
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:51,708
No problem.

394
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,000
No problem , he told me.

395
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,958
With that, with that patience,

396
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,125
It was with him that we learned the most.

397
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,208
We said every day, women, “teacher problem!”.

398
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,458
I mean, as it is, I don't learn, I don't know.

399
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,500
And he said no problem , no problem .

400
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:11,958
He was so cool.

401
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,083
Him,

402
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,083
But more than all he and this one.

403
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,833
He,

404
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,833
who was my teacher too,

405
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,833
I think he is the one who is going to come.

406
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:26,083
Um , he was in Guatemala and has formed a school

407
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,291
in Guatemala with Rodrigo Paris.

408
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,000
Do you know when he's coming or when it is?

409
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,750
When school is here, they told me.

410
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,750
And who is organizing the school thing?

411
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,541
The People of Ipse .

412
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,541
That now with Petro and him

413
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,333
They are with Ecopetrol,

414
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,166
they are going to finance

415
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,708
and I think this is the one that's going to come.

416
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,083
I don't know,

417
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:01,083
He told me like this, all of these are teachers.

418
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,875
This is a little different topic,

419
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:07,041
but what changes have you seen in the environment?

420
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,083
Here?
here.

421
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,083
Well, at the beginning there was a change, of course,

422
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,750
there was joy because

423
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,541
People could charge their cell phones.

424
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,541
The children studied at night, did homework,

425
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,666
I think they're back

426
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,625
the same as before and it makes me sad

427
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,250
sometimes.

428
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,083
That's when they invite me and say

429
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,458
What is the progress? how it moves forward if that is backwards

430
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,333
and it’s embarrassing for me to say that

431
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,416
let's say

432
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:41,833
because children study and that is not known

433
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,708
have put in the effort to say well then

434
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,250
is that they are no longer studying,

435
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,583
I can't charge my cell phone anymore, like they haven't said how

436
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:51,000
please take and buy me a battery, fix it .

437
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,500
No, nobody,

438
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,791
but that is the commitment.

439
00:21:56,791 --> 00:22:00,000
If any organization arrives

440
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,791
to provide us with the battery, that's what I plan to do,

441
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:07,083
In other words, get the family involved

442
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:10,083
that has to advance

443
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,416
money

444
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,458
and we electrify them, if they don’t want to,

445
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,125
It is not electrified.

446
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,041
But is that

447
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:23,041
It is something very small, but it shines.

448
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:26,125
This little light shines a lot at night,

449
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,708
There are four for each family,

450
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:31,708
One here in the kitchen, on the bed inside

451
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,208
and lasts all night.

452
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,083
And does it charge every day?

453
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,000
Every day.

454
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:42,583
This is the,

455
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:45,583
here it connects,

456
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,375
here we connect the,

457
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,458
we make the connection here,

458
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:55,666
here we connect,

459
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,916
We connect here.

460
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:00,916
This is the positive and negative.

461
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,333
Well then

462
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,291
here the panels are connected,

463
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,625
positive-negative solar panels

464
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,416
Battery.

465
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,291
We connect here.

466
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,291
This is for the lamps

467
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,125
in the four lamp.

468
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:46,458
Have you never shorted by mistake?

469
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:47,583
Didn't it short out or burn?

470
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:50,791
No, because you have to be very careful that one

471
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:54,375
do not connect the positive to the negative

472
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:58,750
If any of the resistors is shorted or burned

473
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Ever

And how do you know when they are burned?

474
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,541
With the,

475
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:07,541
with the... what's his name, the tester

476
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,916
Oh, do you have a tester ?
Yes too.

477
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,291
Do you have a multimeter too?

478
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:14,291
Yeah.
You have everything.

479
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:17,208
With that I

480
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:20,083
I realize.

481
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:20,875
already.

482
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,583
Well.

483
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,125
Yeah.

484
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:27,125
That

485
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:31,875
I mean.

486
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:34,500
How is this connected here?

487
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,041
Oh, okay.

488
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,083
And how much do you know how to say it?

489
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,375
How he has control of it.

490
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:43,333
But do you know how charged they are or not?

491
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:47,291
Because here he has the little light when he shines.

492
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,250
AHA.

493
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,208
When it is green he is charging.

494
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:51,250
Good.

495
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,708
When it is red it means it is not charging.

496
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:55,333
to that.

497
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:59,625
You don't know if they are 100% at 50?

498
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:00,583
No.

499
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,625
It is not measured with the tester.

500
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:04,416
Oh okay, and he tells you how much?

501
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,208
Yes of course.

502
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:07,833
How much voltage does the battery have?

503
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:08,750
How much is the voltage?

504
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,750
Maximum 12. 12 and.

505
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:14,250
12.5?

506
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,583
No, ten is not carrying our load.

507
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:19,083
It has to be 12.5.

508
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,500
13 is fine.

509
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,416
Charge to be in English.

510
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:25,041
We have access. Very good.

511
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:26,750
Okay, yes.

512
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,250
Well

513
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,041
well, it is very lamp.

514
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:33,875
I hope they turn on again.

515
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:35,333
Before they did.

516
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,666
It's not very modern,

517
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:41,583
but it is something very, very necessary for the community.

518
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:47,958
It is very necessary because one can go to the neighbor at night

519
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:51,583
and he carries this in his hand, shining.

520
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:54,000
Look how we get to night.

521
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
All dark.

522
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:57,958
Total,

523
00:25:57,958 --> 00:26:01,541
Yes, the light bulb is going to go out now.

524
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:04,208
Mmmmmmmmm well, it's working. Yeah,

525
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:08,958
It's like that, she already knows.

526
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,958
But you know, you learned it from my mom?

527
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:16,000
That is, I had six months in a school in the summer.

528
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:19,666
Yes, she, you know, she's a helper.

529
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:21,375
There you go.

530
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:24,416
There. Wait please.

531
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,291
Oh.

532
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:28,291
What if you already

533
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:32,250
You know, all the components of putting it together and so on.

534
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:35,375
Ahhhh

535
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:38,375
and

536
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,375
that we must move forward

537
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:42,375
but don't do it because it's not easy, quite

538
00:26:42,416 --> 00:26:45,333
easy, though.

539
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:45,916
That's how it is.

540
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:49,166
There is also a lot about passing on knowledge.

541
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,791
The generation.

542
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:55,791
Yes to the one I'm missing in the living room.

543
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,625
No

544
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:00,333
here is the free room.

545
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:01,291
But you know.

546
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:04,291
concentration is needed

547
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,125
because it also comes

548
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,125
many people here visiting and

549
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,708
It's already driving me out of control.

550
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:12,875
Clear.

551
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:15,958
Because that is a concentration, it is closed in 1/4,

552
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:18,833
No

553
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:19,916
change the row.

554
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:22,083
The women are concentrated from there because they don't

555
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,708
They don't know how to cook or anything.

556
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:27,208
Oh, sure, yes.

557
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:30,166
Pure class, pure class

558
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:33,166
from 8 to 12 and from 2 to 5.

559
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:36,625
Every day in the afternoon.

560
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:40,041
So we got up at eight.

561
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,875
Yes Yes.

562
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:45,625
And concentrated there because

563
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:48,666
We no longer thought about children, nor about

564
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,875
not even in the goats,

565
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:54,708
like it says in the book.

566
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:57,708
We had to forget about the goats of the

567
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:57,916
I.

568
00:27:57,916 --> 00:28:00,916
Did you ask

569
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,250
Was Oscar O Car left here alone?

570
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:06,916
Yes how are you.

571
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:07,458
Excellent.

572
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:09,208
You know everything is fine, he said.

573
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:11,416
He never said it was wrong.

574
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:14,416
Oh, of course, and everything is fine, he said.

575
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:17,166
He sits.

576
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:19,875
And there I was, that from and Venezuela

577
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:22,833
and he didn't want to leave them alone here.

578
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:26,416
With the other family.

579
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:28,541
There, yes, with my sister.

580
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:31,541
Sure, but very bi

581
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:34,708
AND

582
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:44,416
Well.

583
00:32:57,416 --> 00:32:59,875
Wow, complicated.

584
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:01,666
But you know. It. What is

585
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:13,583
in sight,

586
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:41,583
No?

587
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:43,250
Well, barely.

588
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,875
If I ask him outside.

589
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:47,875
Yeah.

590
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:51,583
And he learned that whole book.

591
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:54,583
Of course, I

592
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,708
I say of course, it is.
