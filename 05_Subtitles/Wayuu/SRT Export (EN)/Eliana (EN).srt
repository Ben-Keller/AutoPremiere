1
00:00:01:12 --> 00:00:02:14
praying.

2
00:00:03:08 --> 00:00:05:04
Still.

3
00:00:05:15 --> 00:00:06:18
Why would that be?

4
00:00:09:04 --> 00:00:10:11
ok from here

5
00:00:10:11 --> 00:00:13:23
from my point of view,

6
00:00:13:23 --> 00:00:19:06
You know, the quartzes. The rocks? of course, the salt too,

7
00:00:19:06 --> 00:00:21:15
it is also part of the quartz.

8
00:00:22:18 --> 00:00:24:12
So

9
00:00:25:16 --> 00:00:27:02
what's in the salt

10
00:00:27:02 --> 00:00:29:05
is that union of the four elements

11
00:00:31:02 --> 00:00:33:09
water, earth, air

12
00:00:34:01 --> 00:00:36:18
and the fire, which is through the sun,

13
00:00:36:18 --> 00:00:40:09
So it is the union of those four elements where the energy

14
00:00:41:17 --> 00:00:44:14
is in a positive way, that is, the four elements

15
00:00:44:14 --> 00:00:46:22
in one, in a single mineral.

16
00:00:48:00 --> 00:00:51:00
So,

17
00:00:51:00 --> 00:00:54:21
I think that also enhances

18
00:00:56:05 --> 00:00:59:16
what one trusts or believes, right?

19
00:01:00:03 --> 00:01:03:06
It's essentially about having faith.

20
00:01:03:06 --> 00:01:05:24
and as I told you, the energies

21
00:01:08:21 --> 00:01:10:00
like

22
00:01:10:00 --> 00:01:13:06
Any, that is,
because sometimes we buy a normal little quartz

23
00:01:13:14 --> 00:01:17:01
and we have so much faith
that it will cleanse our energies, it will

24
00:01:18:15 --> 00:01:21:02
push away everything negative

25
00:01:21:02 --> 00:01:23:09
look at this mineral that we have here

26
00:01:24:12 --> 00:01:26:24
and have it in quantity

27
00:01:27:07 --> 00:01:29:04
I think it works too.

28
00:01:30:00 --> 00:01:32:04
Well, that depends on each person.

29
00:01:32:04 --> 00:01:35:08
From each person's perspective.

30
00:01:35:17 --> 00:01:37:20
Well, it's a bit of a blessing, isn't it?

31
00:01:37:20 --> 00:01:43:14
Each place has this amount of this mineral
so useful and important

32
00:01:43:15 --> 00:01:44:12
For humans.

33
00:01:47:20 --> 00:01:53:05
Well, I mean for people who believe mainly in the energies,

34
00:01:54:10 --> 00:02:00:18
yes it is very important

35
00:02:00:18 --> 00:02:03:05
I mean, is life.

36
00:02:04:15 --> 00:02:08:11
Salt is life because they are the four elements
that enhance our life

37
00:02:09:14 --> 00:02:14:22
and salt is life, it is energy, it is cleanliness, it is purity.

38
00:02:16:16 --> 00:02:18:07
Sometimes they say that if something bad has happened to you

39
00:02:18:07 --> 00:02:20:14
You should go and throw yourself and throw yourself,

40
00:02:21:19 --> 00:02:24:05
go and throw yourself back into the sea,

41
00:02:25:01 --> 00:02:27:11
because according (to them), the sea, the sea is going to take away

42
00:02:27:11 --> 00:02:30:06
all the negativity, right?

43
00:02:30:22 --> 00:02:35:04
all the negativity you are going through.
take a dip in the sea, and ready,

44
00:02:36:23 --> 00:02:38:07
according to beliefs.

45
00:02:38:07 --> 00:02:41:06
Each person has their different beliefs.

46
00:02:41:06 --> 00:02:43:16
What do you think?

47
00:02:43:22 --> 00:02:47:20
Well... it's complex.

48
00:02:48:01 --> 00:02:50:02
I believe in everything

49
00:02:50:23 --> 00:02:55:19
because you have to respect, but I do believe that,

50
00:02:56:02 --> 00:02:59:20
which is a fundamental part

51
00:03:00:19 --> 00:03:05:16
of cleaning and purifying our energy.

52
00:03:06:03 --> 00:03:10:14
I have my salt jars there
and anytime I feel bad or

53
00:03:11:15 --> 00:03:13:20
I put it on my feet,

54
00:03:15:00 --> 00:03:19:16
In a bucket with water I put a little salt
or leave it in one part

55
00:03:20:03 --> 00:03:23:11
just for, for…

56
00:03:23:13 --> 00:03:26:16
I leave it in a part as for,

57
00:03:26:16 --> 00:03:29:19
as amulet.

58
00:03:29:19 --> 00:03:32:09
And where does that salt you have come from?

59
00:03:33:14 --> 00:03:36:01
From here, from right here.

60
00:03:36:01 --> 00:03:37:07
they are from that

61
00:03:37:18 --> 00:03:40:12
Salt.

62
00:03:41:10 --> 00:03:44:24
in the grains, because after here it happens,

63
00:03:44:24 --> 00:03:46:13
You saw

64
00:03:47:10 --> 00:03:51:05
the trucks that carried the salt
And the part where we met before the museum?

65
00:03:51:18 --> 00:03:54:18
That is where they refine the salt. where they wash it,

66
00:03:55:23 --> 00:03:56:18
that salt

67
00:03:56:18 --> 00:04:01:16
how do you see it here, well, they wash it there and then
moves to Uribia,

68
00:04:01:16 --> 00:04:05:02
where the mills are and there, um, they refine it

69
00:04:06:02 --> 00:04:10:08
and the salt remains fit for consumption.

70
00:04:10:08 --> 00:04:12:10
And you think that well, you're from here

71
00:04:12:10 --> 00:04:16:09
Also this salt is from here, do you think there is a connection?

72
00:04:16:09 --> 00:04:19:24
Here too?

73
00:04:19:24 --> 00:04:24:20
Possibly, yes, yes
because it is important for all Manaureros (the people of her town),

74
00:04:24:20 --> 00:04:28:01
but salt is important to us.

75
00:04:28:01 --> 00:04:31:09
I think more than anything, like,

76
00:04:31:09 --> 00:04:35:04
Like that

77
00:04:36:06 --> 00:04:41:18
means or sustenance that was for our grandparents,

78
00:04:41:18 --> 00:04:46:09
It was an important stage in the growth
and in the development of our municipality.

79
00:04:47:05 --> 00:04:50:13
So,
if salt is always going to be important to us

80
00:04:51:00 --> 00:04:55:08
and that is as I said before,
what we always try to rescue,

81
00:04:56:10 --> 00:04:58:15
don't keep it forgotten

82
00:04:58:15 --> 00:05:02:07
and rescue the values of our cultures
and our salt town. Well,

83
00:05:03:21 --> 00:05:05:10
Manaure is called as

84
00:05:05:10 --> 00:05:07:20
the white bride of Colombia.

85
00:05:09:07 --> 00:05:12:00
That you are right because it is very white.

86
00:05:12:13 --> 00:05:15:22
well it's alright

87
00:05:18:08 --> 00:05:21:16
if we have already been recording,
that's ok. Okay.

88
00:05:22:08 --> 00:05:24:20
But if you don't want us to use any of it, we cut it out.

89
00:05:27:07 --> 00:05:29:10
Well I don't know, I don't know how to get out

90
00:05:29:10 --> 00:05:33:22
No, I think it's very good, very cool,

91
00:05:33:22 --> 00:05:38:16
goes with the whole theme, so

92
00:05:39:24 --> 00:05:43:04
let's go on and

93
00:05:43:04 --> 00:05:47:04
Well, tell me first of all, what is your name?

94
00:05:47:13 --> 00:05:48:09
Who are you?

95
00:05:48:09 --> 00:05:51:14
Ok, nice to meet you, I'm Eliana

96
00:05:51:14 --> 00:05:55:10
Porras, native of here,

97
00:05:55:10 --> 00:05:58:10
from the municipality of Manaure, I belong to the and E´iruku,

98
00:05:59:17 --> 00:06:00:21
Urariyuu

99
00:06:01:14 --> 00:06:03:09
Which is is

100
00:06:03:12 --> 00:06:07:09
part of my maternal family, my grandmother,
my great grandmother,

101
00:06:08:02 --> 00:06:10:04
we are part of that clan

102
00:06:11:10 --> 00:06:13:18
and it is how we characterize ourselves.

103
00:06:13:18 --> 00:06:14:07
Is what ?

104
00:06:15:03 --> 00:06:18:21
E´iruku is our clan, how we identify ourselves,

105
00:06:19:21 --> 00:06:23:10
Well, this comes from the maternal line,

106
00:06:23:10 --> 00:06:28:05
so that's the one that represents me
and the one I represent as well.

107
00:06:28:05 --> 00:06:28:19
Yes of course,

108
00:06:30:03 --> 00:06:31:11
excellent,

109
00:06:32:06 --> 00:06:35:01
Where are we right now?

110
00:06:36:15 --> 00:06:38:19
Well right now we are

111
00:06:38:19 --> 00:06:42:14
in a part of the ponds

112
00:06:42:14 --> 00:06:46:03
largest in Colombia, in Manaure, La Guajira,

113
00:06:47:07 --> 00:06:50:13
And puddles of what? Salt ponds, huge pools

114
00:06:50:20 --> 00:06:57:10
of sea salt.

115
00:06:57:10 --> 00:06:59:11
I mean, we were at the Ichi museum.

116
00:07:00:03 --> 00:07:03:03
you can tell me,

117
00:07:03:03 --> 00:07:07:23
Well, what connection does that have?

118
00:07:07:23 --> 00:07:11:20
The Ichi Salt Museum,
it is a family business

119
00:07:13:23 --> 00:07:16:14
where to rescue

120
00:07:16:14 --> 00:07:19:19
all that salt culture of this municipality.

121
00:07:21:02 --> 00:07:24:15
We seek to show how

122
00:07:25:23 --> 00:07:28:17
was the process, how were the beginnings

123
00:07:28:23 --> 00:07:33:09
From this process of collecting salt here
in the municipality of Manaure.

124
00:07:33:09 --> 00:07:37:04
Previously,

125
00:07:39:18 --> 00:07:41:21
the waters brought from the Arroyo Limón

126
00:07:42:03 --> 00:07:45:18
and the Caribbean Sea came together in this space
where we meet

127
00:07:46:10 --> 00:07:49:23
And, over time,these were returned.

128
00:07:50:10 --> 00:07:52:11
The sea returned to its place.

129
00:07:52:12 --> 00:07:55:14
The stream over there
also returned to its place

130
00:07:56:22 --> 00:07:59:04
and there were huge lagoons.

131
00:07:59:19 --> 00:08:04:18
These lagoons with the passing of the days
took the form of a sheet or crystalline film,

132
00:08:04:18 --> 00:08:09:16
because with the environmental conditions
with which we count

133
00:08:09:24 --> 00:08:13:02
what is the franciscan artemia , artemia

134
00:08:13:03 --> 00:08:15:08
Salina, who told her that it is a crustacean

135
00:08:17:08 --> 00:08:19:09
gives that characteristic reddish color

136
00:08:19:09 --> 00:08:21:24
to waters and

137
00:08:23:01 --> 00:08:26:22
to shrimp, flamingos and herons.

138
00:08:26:22 --> 00:08:31:16
So it's like counting and making known that

139
00:08:31:17 --> 00:08:36:14
that story we have,
because Manaure is a place full of a lot of history,

140
00:08:37:19 --> 00:08:42:11
full of a lot of culture and a lot of love.

141
00:08:42:11 --> 00:08:45:18
Cool. And… can you tell me about

142
00:08:45:18 --> 00:08:50:02
salt from the perspective of mythology

143
00:08:50:02 --> 00:08:52:22
And that love of the four elements?

144
00:08:53:19 --> 00:08:57:00
Well, the legend tells that

145
00:08:58:01 --> 00:09:00:03
Mma, mother earth

146
00:09:00:03 --> 00:09:03:03
She was walking through these beautiful lands

147
00:09:03:06 --> 00:09:06:08
and enjoying the cosmos,

148
00:09:06:21 --> 00:09:12:00
He enjoyed nature and she on her way,

149
00:09:12:00 --> 00:09:15:00
And then, She meets Wüin , which is water.

150
00:09:15:16 --> 00:09:18:18
He was a brave warrior, he went with his bow,

151
00:09:18:18 --> 00:09:22:19
his arrows and then they meet and fall in love.

152
00:09:24:11 --> 00:09:25:20
they fell in love and

153
00:09:25:20 --> 00:09:30:18
they lived an intense love that was embraced by Joutai
what is the wind

154
00:09:31:09 --> 00:09:34:05
and powered by caí, which is the sun.

155
00:09:35:07 --> 00:09:39:09
From this intense love is born

156
00:09:39:10 --> 00:09:42:00
the sea salt crystals

157
00:09:42:24 --> 00:09:46:13
So it's like the explanation

158
00:09:46:20 --> 00:09:51:08
that our ancestors gave to this beautiful

159
00:09:51:19 --> 00:09:54:18
or to these beautiful minerals that we possess

160
00:09:55:05 --> 00:09:57:24
here in our territory,

161
00:09:58:05 --> 00:10:02:10
that they are enhancers of life and that,

162
00:10:03:05 --> 00:10:05:19
It is a space or a place where

163
00:10:05:19 --> 00:10:09:24
the four elements are managed that are the earth,

164
00:10:10:11 --> 00:10:13:14
water, air and fire,

165
00:10:13:14 --> 00:10:16:12
and in this case the sun.

166
00:10:17:14 --> 00:10:21:00
So it's like that enhancement of life

167
00:10:21:00 --> 00:10:25:06
through these four elements
and that we have the pleasure

168
00:10:26:01 --> 00:10:28:15
and the honor of having in our territory.

169
00:10:29:22 --> 00:10:31:02
Yes, yes and what

170
00:10:31:02 --> 00:10:33:20
Can you tell the importance of salt?

171
00:10:35:01 --> 00:10:38:10
Well, salt is for life.

172
00:10:39:19 --> 00:10:43:02
I feel like with food,

173
00:10:44:10 --> 00:10:47:13
when there’s no

174
00:10:48:20 --> 00:10:53:14
salt lacks seasoning, but not excessively.

175
00:10:53:18 --> 00:10:54:20
Because,

176
00:10:55:13 --> 00:11:00:12
But here in Manaure salt is important

177
00:11:00:12 --> 00:11:05:18
because apart from that it was an important factor

178
00:11:05:18 --> 00:11:10:21
in the economic growth of the municipality, was the,

179
00:11:11:22 --> 00:11:14:20
well it was like,

180
00:11:15:24 --> 00:11:18:12
that, that, I mean,

181
00:11:18:15 --> 00:11:19:24
It is important because,

182
00:11:19:24 --> 00:11:22:13
because of how our parents came out

183
00:11:24:21 --> 00:11:26:04
forward because of

184
00:11:26:04 --> 00:11:28:16
of the effort, of the exploitation of salt

185
00:11:29:10 --> 00:11:32:10
of this mineral, which

186
00:11:32:10 --> 00:11:34:23
it's a craft,

187
00:11:34:23 --> 00:11:38:01
Well,
its collection was produced before in an artisanal way

188
00:11:38:10 --> 00:11:40:12
and our grandparents were dedicated to this

189
00:11:41:13 --> 00:11:44:00
also,

190
00:11:44:00 --> 00:11:46:20
thanks to this
they had their livelihood, their education

191
00:11:47:01 --> 00:11:49:20
And thanks to that, we are also here.

192
00:11:50:13 --> 00:11:55:22
Yes, can you tell me the artisan way
to collect the salt

193
00:11:55:22 --> 00:11:59:22
and in history
Well, how do women play their role? Okay,

194
00:12:01:06 --> 00:12:03:16
well the artisan way

195
00:12:03:16 --> 00:12:06:12
to collect the salt is with

196
00:12:07:21 --> 00:12:10:12
shovels and picks, then,

197
00:12:11:18 --> 00:12:15:02
what we see, the whole lagoon that I was commenting on

198
00:12:15:03 --> 00:12:18:21
that were formed, with the passing of time
they became solid

199
00:12:20:19 --> 00:12:23:13
They, well, with the shovel and pick

200
00:12:23:13 --> 00:12:27:18
They are cut and collected in those little ones,

201
00:12:27:22 --> 00:12:31:03
In these small pyramids are collected

202
00:12:31:24 --> 00:12:34:15
and this is a process very,

203
00:12:35:19 --> 00:12:38:11
It's a bit demanding.

204
00:12:38:11 --> 00:12:44:05
but it is not,

205
00:12:44:05 --> 00:12:47:16
Rocket science either.

206
00:12:47:16 --> 00:12:50:03
And well, as you see,

207
00:12:50:03 --> 00:12:53:11
The salt pans are huge

208
00:12:54:06 --> 00:12:59:09
and the work was previously divided in a family way.

209
00:12:59:13 --> 00:13:01:15
It was in a family way

210
00:13:01:20 --> 00:13:04:00
the parents came

211
00:13:04:00 --> 00:13:08:20
children, nephews,
They all came, around four in the morning

212
00:13:08:20 --> 00:13:12:09
until ten at night, ten in the morning,

213
00:13:12:24 --> 00:13:17:07
and then again at four in the afternoon
and until nightfall.

214
00:13:17:07 --> 00:13:19:07
As I mentioned earlier, how

215
00:13:21:00 --> 00:13:24:07
This led to what became bartering,

216
00:13:24:24 --> 00:13:29:01
because there were people who stayed
the entire day and

217
00:13:30:11 --> 00:13:33:21
there were entrepreneurs
who set up their little shops and sold

218
00:13:33:21 --> 00:13:37:17
what was the chicha, the water,

219
00:13:37:17 --> 00:13:42:16
the lunches made for these people
and they were exchanged for only a lump of salt,

220
00:13:43:00 --> 00:13:45:18
a little lump of salt for the food, for la chicha,

221
00:13:45:18 --> 00:13:49:07
what they want to consume.

222
00:13:49:07 --> 00:13:52:08
Also
there were women who were in charge of the distribution

223
00:13:52:08 --> 00:13:57:08
of the salt, which were collected,

224
00:13:57:09 --> 00:14:01:22
were largely collected
and when distributing and selling came,

225
00:14:02:08 --> 00:14:07:05
owners were already notified that they could
Go claim their money.

226
00:14:08:01 --> 00:14:10:11
And it was also a way of,

227
00:14:11:19 --> 00:14:14:13
distribution, distribution of the salt

228
00:14:14:13 --> 00:14:16:24
and higher growth, economic growth.

229
00:14:18:16 --> 00:14:20:22
And the women were the bosses?

230
00:14:20:22 --> 00:14:23:10
The women were the bosses.

231
00:14:23:10 --> 00:14:25:02
Some women were the bosses

232
00:14:27:20 --> 00:14:31:15
and are recognized for being matronas (female leaders).

233
00:14:32:12 --> 00:14:36:06
Here in this space that was given here

234
00:14:36:06 --> 00:14:41:10
in the 1960's

235
00:14:41:10 --> 00:14:44:17
1970, which was like that golden age

236
00:14:44:23 --> 00:14:47:21
where was the exploitation seen
of salt to a great extent.

237
00:14:49:02 --> 00:14:50:22
And now, well, we've talked

238
00:14:50:22 --> 00:14:55:07
and we have seen that there is a lot of industrialization
of the salt, which

239
00:14:55:07 --> 00:14:57:23
effects has that had?

240
00:14:57:24 --> 00:15:00:15
What changes have happened here in so long?

241
00:15:01:14 --> 00:15:03:15
So, how

242
00:15:05:02 --> 00:15:07:20
Well

243
00:15:09:01 --> 00:15:14:04
salt, industrialization of salt

244
00:15:14:12 --> 00:15:18:01
13 years ago is no longer the same

245
00:15:19:14 --> 00:15:22:07
right now here in the municipality well they are,

246
00:15:23:03 --> 00:15:26:13
They are mobilizing the companies

247
00:15:27:15 --> 00:15:29:19
That are private, but the company

248
00:15:30:15 --> 00:15:32:22
Sama or Big Group that

249
00:15:32:22 --> 00:15:36:14
It's what they were called before, well no,

250
00:15:37:17 --> 00:15:40:03
it has not been, well,

251
00:15:40:03 --> 00:15:46:02
There's been trouble, I couldn't tell you
good because I don't know the subject very well, but

252
00:15:48:06 --> 00:15:51:06
Business was no longer the same as it used to,

253
00:15:53:05 --> 00:15:58:18
there was like a break from that so beautiful that we had

254
00:15:59:07 --> 00:16:02:16
and something that was left to lose,

255
00:16:03:03 --> 00:16:04:02
I don't know,

256
00:16:04:02 --> 00:16:06:18
well, i don't have the reasons
don't have the main reasons,

257
00:16:07:08 --> 00:16:11:00
But, the Manaure that we have now is not the same

258
00:16:11:01 --> 00:16:14:01
that we had 30 years ago,

259
00:16:15:09 --> 00:16:19:04
where you could see the beautiful white mountains.

260
00:16:19:04 --> 00:16:22:19
But hey, trusting that,

261
00:16:22:19 --> 00:16:27:03
In which soon, soon

262
00:16:27:04 --> 00:16:29:04
We will go back to that golden age.

263
00:16:32:13 --> 00:16:34:07
You can tell me,

264
00:16:34:07 --> 00:16:36:04
well, wait

265
00:16:37:17 --> 00:16:40:01
a time that I wrote a lot.

266
00:16:41:10 --> 00:16:43:10
oh well, and

267
00:16:43:18 --> 00:16:46:09
here we are next to the sea, right?

268
00:16:46:10 --> 00:16:46:23
and can you

269
00:16:46:23 --> 00:16:51:02
Tell me something about that kind of people,

270
00:16:52:14 --> 00:16:54:14
Well, the fishermen and

271
00:16:54:21 --> 00:17:01:20
I don't know if they have a relationship between those of the salt?

272
00:17:01:20 --> 00:17:06:06
Well, the fishermen are in the Wayuú culture

273
00:17:06:15 --> 00:17:10:07
They are the Apalaanchi, they are the people of the sea, they,

274
00:17:10:21 --> 00:17:15:20
They are the people who were dedicated to fishing ,

275
00:17:16:11 --> 00:17:20:13
to the distribution of these fish
and all that, they were like people,

276
00:17:21:15 --> 00:17:22:07
the people of the

277
00:17:22:07 --> 00:17:26:06
sea, as they say,

278
00:17:26:06 --> 00:17:30:20
were two great economies
that moved the municipality in its beginnings,

279
00:17:32:01 --> 00:17:35:10
but

280
00:17:36:15 --> 00:17:38:16
with the exploitation of salt,

281
00:17:38:16 --> 00:17:41:18
there were people
who were engaged in both jobs,

282
00:17:42:12 --> 00:17:44:22
But... it's not something that,

283
00:17:47:02 --> 00:17:49:09
that had

284
00:17:49:09 --> 00:17:52:19
some meaning, no.

285
00:17:54:06 --> 00:17:59:02
So well, like the new generation here of salt and stuff,

286
00:18:01:12 --> 00:18:03:14
I don't know, what connection do you have with the

287
00:18:03:15 --> 00:18:07:17
Salt, what relationship do you have with salt? How is your way of life?

288
00:18:11:06 --> 00:18:14:19
I believe a lot in energies,

289
00:18:16:07 --> 00:18:19:19
I believe in energy
positive energies, negative energies

290
00:18:20:07 --> 00:18:23:16
and I think that for me the salt is,

291
00:18:25:14 --> 00:18:29:05
the one that keeps me from all the negativity,

292
00:18:29:19 --> 00:18:32:05
of all negative energies
that can come into my life,

293
00:18:33:18 --> 00:18:38:13
or some, but I do think that for me

294
00:18:40:10 --> 00:18:42:10
has a,

295
00:18:42:22 --> 00:18:46:16
has some relevance because I do trust

296
00:18:46:16 --> 00:18:51:20
that can ward off bad energy
and I trust that I can do well, that salt

297
00:18:52:19 --> 00:18:55:10
can absorb all that negativity.

298
00:18:56:22 --> 00:18:58:20
What I can attract

299
00:18:58:20 --> 00:19:01:23
The negativity,
she can absorb it if I have her close.

300
00:19:02:20 --> 00:19:03:11
In which way

301
00:19:03:11 --> 00:19:06:17
so? in the form of quartz,

302
00:19:07:16 --> 00:19:09:21
in the way of quartz, way

303
00:19:10:12 --> 00:19:15:12
that if I can bathe with this mineral

304
00:19:16:15 --> 00:19:20:17
I can also feel more relieved

305
00:19:21:18 --> 00:19:23:22
and all that.

306
00:19:23:22 --> 00:19:27:13
And is that also something that the family does as well? Yes of course.

307
00:19:27:13 --> 00:19:29:10
Well, not all families.

308
00:19:29:10 --> 00:19:31:18
I think that in my family it is something that,

309
00:19:33:05 --> 00:19:36:06
it is something that can be done.

310
00:19:36:06 --> 00:19:39:00
Well, things are passed from generation to generation,

311
00:19:39:08 --> 00:19:41:12
It's something I've learned from her.

312
00:19:43:03 --> 00:19:48:12
I come from a family of salt harvesters.

313
00:19:48:21 --> 00:19:50:01
Like

314
00:19:50:01 --> 00:19:53:13
my grandfather was also a fisherman.

315
00:19:54:18 --> 00:19:56:04
So

316
00:19:56:04 --> 00:19:59:21
I think that connection with salt

317
00:19:59:22 --> 00:20:01:13
through my family

318
00:20:01:13 --> 00:20:05:20
who has dedicated to this,
dedicated to the harvest of salt

319
00:20:07:05 --> 00:20:09:17
and later

320
00:20:09:17 --> 00:20:12:20
that we wanted like that

321
00:20:13:06 --> 00:20:15:15
relive these stories,

322
00:20:15:17 --> 00:20:20:04
dust off these memories we have

323
00:20:20:20 --> 00:20:24:12
or that many do not know
and let us know, show them.

324
00:20:26:13 --> 00:20:28:13
Is there anything else you want to tell us about all this?

325
00:20:28:13 --> 00:20:32:01
That what was i asking you ?

326
00:20:34:02 --> 00:20:38:22
Anything else?

327
00:20:38:22 --> 00:20:40:12
I could not tell.

328
00:20:40:12 --> 00:20:41:23
Right now I'm blank

329
00:20:41:23 --> 00:20:47:22
No! you have talked a lot about many things

330
00:20:47:22 --> 00:20:48:24
No, I don’t think so

331
00:20:48:24 --> 00:20:51:03
Believe. Believe.

332
00:20:51:24 --> 00:20:56:16
Well, if you would have a message
that could take the whole world,

333
00:20:57:04 --> 00:20:59:01
What would it be?

334
00:20:59:17 --> 00:21:00:07
My message

335
00:21:00:07 --> 00:21:03:11
It would be… to love our roots.

336
00:21:04:19 --> 00:21:06:03
To love our roots.

337
00:21:06:03 --> 00:21:08:07
And let's not be ashamed of our origins.

338
00:21:11:22 --> 00:21:13:08
let's learn,

339
00:21:13:08 --> 00:21:16:09
As its said, those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it.

340
00:21:16:09 --> 00:21:17:08
right?

341
00:21:17:10 --> 00:21:21:16
Let's learn from that,

342
00:21:21:17 --> 00:21:25:02
of those processes that our

343
00:21:25:02 --> 00:21:27:13
grandparents, our parents, to get where they are

344
00:21:28:09 --> 00:21:31:20
and always keeping our roots in mind,

345
00:21:33:05 --> 00:21:36:17
loving, valuing and respecting our culture.

346
00:21:37:22 --> 00:21:42:23
And well, like that
What does it mean to be Wayuu to you?

347
00:21:44:19 --> 00:21:48:06
For me, to be Wayuu,

348
00:21:48:06 --> 00:21:51:12
It's wonderful, to be Wayuu

349
00:21:54:00 --> 00:21:57:03
Well, I characterize myself as a strong woman,

350
00:21:58:16 --> 00:22:01:23
regardless of stereotypes

351
00:22:01:23 --> 00:22:07:05
that they form, I think that women,

352
00:22:07:09 --> 00:22:11:04
Wayuu women are strong women

353
00:22:11:06 --> 00:22:13:22
and strong householders

354
00:22:14:23 --> 00:22:16:24
and for something,

355
00:22:18:01 --> 00:22:20:19
I consider myself

356
00:22:20:19 --> 00:22:22:22
that for me to be wayuu

357
00:22:25:07 --> 00:22:28:01
it is like,

358
00:22:28:14 --> 00:22:30:15
It's just that I remembered something else.

359
00:22:30:15 --> 00:22:35:16
Well, there was something they were talking about
the historians here,

360
00:22:36:06 --> 00:22:40:05
the knowledgeable people here of our municipality,
and it was that,

361
00:22:42:03 --> 00:22:44:23
in Spanish writings,

362
00:22:44:23 --> 00:22:48:22
the wayuu, the wayuu indigenous people were called as

363
00:22:50:13 --> 00:22:52:07
indomitable,

364
00:22:52:11 --> 00:22:53:17
Were,

365
00:22:53:17 --> 00:22:57:24
it was a culture
that did not allow itself to be dominated by the Spanish,

366
00:22:58:18 --> 00:23:02:24
who handled the horses very well,

367
00:23:03:08 --> 00:23:06:16
the weapons they had

368
00:23:06:16 --> 00:23:09:12
in those moments and that they didn’t let them.

369
00:23:10:02 --> 00:23:12:12
So for me

370
00:23:14:01 --> 00:23:15:09
To be wayuu,

371
00:23:15:09 --> 00:23:18:15
means temper, character

372
00:23:19:21 --> 00:23:21:17
and a lot of strength.

373
00:23:21:17 --> 00:23:24:18
Resilience too.

374
00:23:25:11 --> 00:23:28:11
Thank you thank you very much. You are welcome.

375
00:23:28:11 --> 00:23:29:10
Anything else?

376
00:23:29:10 --> 00:23:32:02
I don't know, it's just that I'm blank.

377
00:23:32:02 --> 00:23:34:17
Not well. Do they have a question for you?

378
00:23:34:17 --> 00:23:35:18
What question?

379
00:23:37:20 --> 00:23:42:09
What is the first thing they see, what do they do
to make the salt?

380
00:23:42:16 --> 00:23:47:07
What is the first thing they do?

381
00:23:47:07 --> 00:23:49:17
Well, the water, right?

382
00:23:49:17 --> 00:23:51:06
The sea water.

383
00:23:51:21 --> 00:23:55:15
the first thing to do
is to supply these spaces with water,

384
00:23:56:18 --> 00:23:58:16
No? What is done?

385
00:23:58:16 --> 00:24:00:18
What is made is the water,

386
00:24:01:17 --> 00:24:04:01
grab the water, pass it through the pipe

387
00:24:05:04 --> 00:24:09:01
and spend it there
where the white house is, there to settle.

388
00:24:09:07 --> 00:24:11:17
Aha!, wait for it to evaporate and in one

389
00:24:12:04 --> 00:24:16:09
AHA!

390
00:24:16:09 --> 00:24:18:17
Well, the water, it's the water.

391
00:24:18:23 --> 00:24:21:15
That's interesting, isn't it? That connection between the sea and

392
00:24:22:21 --> 00:24:25:02
the earth. and what happens when it rains?

393
00:24:25:19 --> 00:24:27:24
Work is damaged. work is damaged,

394
00:24:29:03 --> 00:24:30:03
Water? so

395
00:24:30:03 --> 00:24:31:13
There is a lack of rain.

396
00:24:31:13 --> 00:24:34:14
It's not much water here sometimes,
but it helps a lot in this job.

397
00:24:35:01 --> 00:24:38:24
Yes, this lake is very important,

398
00:24:38:24 --> 00:24:42:15
but in the rainy season, previously

399
00:24:42:15 --> 00:24:44:20
when everyone had their huge piles of salt

400
00:24:47:01 --> 00:24:49:17
and well the droplets and the drizzle came,

401
00:24:49:17 --> 00:24:55:05
then they commented that they were all running
to cover the salt

402
00:24:55:05 --> 00:24:57:10
or sometimes they even cried for their losses.

403
00:24:59:07 --> 00:25:02:22
The highest setting is when it rains?

404
00:25:03:23 --> 00:25:06:24
But you hardly see it anymore

405
00:25:07:08 --> 00:25:10:07
production in this way by hand.

406
00:25:10:24 --> 00:25:13:09
Nene, are the gentlemen here? Who works here? The Wayuu

407
00:25:15:15 --> 00:25:17:07
and they come every day?

408
00:25:17:07 --> 00:25:20:13
or sometimes. Every day, in the morning. In the morning, nothing else?

409
00:25:20:24 --> 00:25:23:19
Until two

410
00:25:23:22 --> 00:25:25:02
With this sun

411
00:25:25:22 --> 00:25:27:11
It has to be late

412
00:25:27:17 --> 00:25:30:09
And come back again in the morning.

413
00:25:30:09 --> 00:25:34:05
Yes, possibly if you come in the morning
you can meet them and they can

414
00:25:35:04 --> 00:25:37:11
Tell a bit deeper

415
00:25:37:11 --> 00:25:40:08
about the process they have.

416
00:25:40:08 --> 00:25:43:12
It's a very good job.

417
00:25:44:09 --> 00:25:46:05
And well, nervous, but good.

418
00:25:46:05 --> 00:25:50:15
No, no, you didn't seem nervous, did you?

419
00:25:50:15 --> 00:25:55:24
they wonder.

420
00:25:55:24 --> 00:26:01:01
Well, another thing is, maybe it's not related,
maybe it doesn't work,

421
00:26:01:01 --> 00:26:04:14
but here Colombia is a country of magical realism.

422
00:26:04:21 --> 00:26:08:18
Yeah well, I've seen magic in a lot of things

423
00:26:08:18 --> 00:26:10:13
Here,

424
00:26:10:13 --> 00:26:14:04
in the Guajira
What is magic for you or where is it?

425
00:26:14:04 --> 00:26:18:05
see that?

426
00:26:18:05 --> 00:26:23:16
More than all magic, it is spirituality,

427
00:26:23:16 --> 00:26:25:23
Here we represent it with red.

428
00:26:26:13 --> 00:26:32:03
Red is spirituality because it is blood.

429
00:26:32:03 --> 00:26:35:13
Dreams

430
00:26:35:13 --> 00:26:38:13
They are, well, they manifest in many ways.

431
00:26:39:19 --> 00:26:42:09
In culture you have a

432
00:26:42:09 --> 00:26:45:16
Piache what is it

433
00:26:45:16 --> 00:26:49:11
the woman who is appointed,

434
00:26:49:14 --> 00:26:53:24
she does not choose, she is chosen
and is the one in charge

435
00:26:53:24 --> 00:26:58:17
of all processes
to interpret dreams, to carry out

436
00:26:58:18 --> 00:27:01:20
Bathings in the event of a threat

437
00:27:01:20 --> 00:27:07:05
or before a premonition,

438
00:27:07:05 --> 00:27:11:16
like she is in charge of
to carry out all those rituals,

439
00:27:13:10 --> 00:27:17:02
the rituals
of dreams with the dance of la yonna

440
00:27:19:04 --> 00:27:21:12
and all that encompasses spirituality,

441
00:27:22:09 --> 00:27:25:21
which here focuses more on the color red

442
00:27:27:14 --> 00:27:32:08
and it is a very complex issue, very complex, but,

443
00:27:33:13 --> 00:27:38:23
but if more than magic it would be spirituality.

444
00:27:38:23 --> 00:27:40:02
and the red,

445
00:27:40:02 --> 00:27:42:11
blood . Of the blood,

446
00:27:43:17 --> 00:27:46:02
of force, of fire

447
00:27:47:21 --> 00:27:48:07
… the Red.

448
00:27:49:05 --> 00:27:55:13
When you have dreams, you have dreams

449
00:27:57:03 --> 00:28:01:05
with certain characteristics

450
00:28:01:05 --> 00:28:04:05
we are asked to bathe

451
00:28:05:09 --> 00:28:07:21
and we put something red,

452
00:28:07:21 --> 00:28:10:14
a red blanket or something red

453
00:28:11:06 --> 00:28:14:07
and we lock ourselves up to scare away.

454
00:28:15:00 --> 00:28:16:11
Would be like,

455
00:28:16:22 --> 00:28:19:04
Like, there are dreams,

456
00:28:19:17 --> 00:28:23:02
Well I've heard there are interpretations

457
00:28:23:17 --> 00:28:27:15
like when they are bees

458
00:28:27:20 --> 00:28:30:24
they refer to bullets

459
00:28:30:24 --> 00:28:33:10
and then

460
00:28:33:14 --> 00:28:37:03
interpreting it
it may be that this person is in danger

461
00:28:38:11 --> 00:28:40:05
from some shot

462
00:28:40:05 --> 00:28:44:19
or something, then like to scare away
that, that negative energy,

463
00:28:44:19 --> 00:28:49:08
as well as to scare her away
they can perform some baths,

464
00:28:50:12 --> 00:28:54:12
there are bathings that are simply water and lock yourself in

465
00:28:55:22 --> 00:28:58:05
or others that are

466
00:28:58:05 --> 00:29:00:11
with some medicinal plants,

467
00:29:01:12 --> 00:29:04:01
with ice, cold water and all that.

468
00:29:05:16 --> 00:29:08:23
Well

469
00:29:10:05 --> 00:29:12:24
Can you explain me

470
00:29:12:24 --> 00:29:15:18
Also, is the handle related?

471
00:29:16:02 --> 00:29:17:23
Ah, the handle.

472
00:29:17:23 --> 00:29:22:15
This handle is made with bija.

473
00:29:23:13 --> 00:29:26:16
The bija is like a style of wood,

474
00:29:28:11 --> 00:29:29:22
this

475
00:29:29:22 --> 00:29:33:03
It is said that it is to ward off diseases

476
00:29:33:19 --> 00:29:38:22
and to keep us healthy,
so it's like she absorbs it and also

477
00:29:39:15 --> 00:29:43:05
this is a little piece
babies are placed when they are

478
00:29:43:11 --> 00:29:46:09
when they are months old

479
00:29:46:09 --> 00:29:49:23
It was also well known and longed for

480
00:29:49:23 --> 00:29:52:20
at the time, in the time of pandemic,

481
00:29:53:09 --> 00:29:56:14
It was longed for here, by us,

482
00:29:57:18 --> 00:30:00:21
The, well, those of us who know the properties

483
00:30:00:21 --> 00:30:05:03
or what is done with this bija, then

484
00:30:06:08 --> 00:30:07:24
there it was like

485
00:30:07:24 --> 00:30:11:14
incense style and as well as to move away,

486
00:30:12:14 --> 00:30:15:19
remove or purify the environment to

487
00:30:15:23 --> 00:30:21:09
so that there would be no disease,
so that COVID did not reach our homes.

488
00:30:21:09 --> 00:30:24:01
And I think it worked.

489
00:30:24:01 --> 00:30:25:20
Here we are, healthy.

490
00:30:25:20 --> 00:30:29:21
And yes, this is a style

491
00:30:30:21 --> 00:30:32:21
of wood

492
00:30:32:21 --> 00:30:35:04
that comes from a plant, from a medicinal plant,

493
00:30:36:20 --> 00:30:42:09
So yes, and they burn it and it smells good, it smells good.

494
00:30:42:15 --> 00:30:44:06
It has a good smell

495
00:30:44:06 --> 00:30:46:19
So that wood specifically?

496
00:30:47:10 --> 00:30:50:04
Yeah. Is.
Not just any wood.

497
00:30:50:04 --> 00:30:53:06
No, no, no, this one comes from a tree.

498
00:30:53:06 --> 00:30:55:14
I don't know the name of the tree, but,

499
00:30:55:14 --> 00:30:58:15
But it is a type of wood that smells rich.
