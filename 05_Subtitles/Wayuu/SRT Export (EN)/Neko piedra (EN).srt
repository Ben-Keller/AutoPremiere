1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We meet at the alatsu stone

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
with an ancient stone that dates back many years,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that from our own worldview we can look from what,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
from the mythological.

00:17: - 00:21
They say that once Maleiwa, the god of the Wayúu,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
came down in this place

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
because he was worried about the situation in what
the Wayúu were found

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
because they had no way to identify themselves within Wayuu society.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So he decided to organize a contest with the birds.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That was where the curlew was, that was where the Zamuro was, there was the
bird they call Pico Gordo, the Utta (dotted bobito)

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So he decided to organize that contest

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
to choose

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
something that would identify the Wayúu people.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Then Cataneja began to sing and began to sing.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Toulijana, toulijana, toulijana (anklet)

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Maleiwa did not like the Cataneja song

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Toulijana means that which hangs on the ankles.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And then they called Walusechi

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and began to sing son'tusu to'i, son'tusu toi, son'tusu

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
my feet are cramping, is the translation

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and Maleiwa did not like the song of the two birds.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And then Utta, who is the bird, entered
fat beak and began to sing

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Pushaina with Arpushana, Ipuana with Epieyu.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Sapuana with Ipuana, he began to sing mentioning
those striking words.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Then Maleiwa (God) said, I do like that, I do like this.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Let's choose

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
that phrase, those words that

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
that you sang in the song, Pushaina with Arpushana

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Ipuana with Epieyu, Sapuana with Ulewana. He highlighted all of those

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So from there

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Maleiwa began to distribute to each Wayúu family,

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
which are the respective clans, with their respective brand

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and in what is now embodied in stone,

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
that from the mythological part.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Now, if we go back in history

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
we can realize that the word Jeerü

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
In wayunaiki (wayuu language) it comes from herraje

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Jeerü comes from horseshoe.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We know very well that livestock farming is not typical of the Wayúu,

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
but they were brought by the colony.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So what is the cow, what is the goat

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
They are not our own, but we as a Wayuu people

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We adopt it and give it a name,

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
we use the label

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
like Jeerü , which is horseshoe

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
also the words, if we can analyze ourselves
the ear cutting of animals.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It comes from asu'araluja which is the word in wayunaiki
or point in Spanish

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There is no original word of its own that comes from
Wayúu people, but it was a product

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
of Spanish domination when they brought us livestock

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and we realize.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But the Wayúu, since he is so creative,

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It is a town that adapts, that adjusts

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
to all the circumstances,

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He captured it in his myth and we adopted it as our origin,

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
about the symbology of the Wayuu people,

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's what the oral tradition tells,

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes, of course, that is the rock that tells the origins
of the Wayuu people.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, this is the stone of Alatsu,

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
which tells about the origins of the clans,

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What clans are, it's like a

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
classification within Wayuu society

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
There are around 22 clans currently, but
Previously there were other clans.

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We can give an approximate of 32 clans that existed
previously,

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
but that, due to various circumstances, due to problems
of inter claníles

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:03,000
many of those clans disappeared and became extinct
for some, some war

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and due to various circumstances
Those clans disappeared.

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But currently there are 22 clans in force.

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
which are what is currently and are present
throughout the department of La Guajira.

68
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Well teacher, I come from Alkualü, Manaure

69
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
To learn more about the culture, and where

70
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It comes from the story that our
ancestors about our symbols

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So, for you to tell me again, but in wayunaiki

72
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
About God, yes, that started from
maleiwa concern

73
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He felt sad, because people were
disorganized, they looked like animals

74
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
There was no organization or structure that
classify families

75
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So that's where the birds called,
like the buzzard, like utta

76
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and others, like them or the birds, were before people, yes, true.

77
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So he decided to have a singing contest.
to choose the best

78
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Since the names they choose will remain as a legacy
to future generations

79
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
They will be your family lineages

80
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Then the other sang and he didn't like it,
the other one too and he didn't like it either

81
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The only song he liked was Utta's

82
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He liked the words Pushaina, Ipuana, Epieyu
God liked all the ones he mentioned

83
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
for the song

84
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Its reward was a necklace, which is why the bird has
a line down his neck, yes.

85
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes, that was his reward, it was like his payment

86
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
How interesting to know that the bloodlines came out
of a bird's song

87
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If it was Utta, and how did he sing?

88
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That same one, wayuu said Epieyu, Pushaina, Epinayu Ipuana Uriana

89
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So from there the eirüku (family lineage) arose.

90
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I am Epieyu. What is your professional lineage? Uriana, wayuu
Uriana, from the cat or tiger

91
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If each one was given an animal to represent them
as the stone shows

92
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,000
If each group was told, this is going to be your lineage,
you will be Pushaina, you will be Ipuana, Sapuana

93
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And which is the Uriana here? It's over here, where?

94
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Uriana, Uriana

95
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Here is the Epieyu, Pushaina, Epieyu

96
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Is this Epieyu? Yes, well this is my lineage, yes.
My mother is Epieyu

97
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Because, ah look this is my eirüku (lineage) Urina,
yes , the one with a head

98
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Where I come from, in Akualü, Manaure the Uriana
They are my grandfathers and grandmothers so you are my grandfather

99
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And look here they are together

100
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It is one of the oldest lineages in the
which ones come off others

101
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
There are many, there is the Jusayu, there is the Sapuana

102
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The Pausayu that is from Magalys

103
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
How interesting

104
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So it was formed then, I saw it only in leaves

105
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
In pictures

106
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's how I saw it, but I'm here to know

107
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
because there are many people who brag about
being Wayuu and they don't know anything about the culture

108
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Instead

109
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I can say from now on that I know the origin of
our ancestors and this stone

110
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Now I know that it was Utta who stipulated this, who created it

111
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Because I only knew that he was a talker but not wise
that I name the lineages

112
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Well teacher, thanks for continuing

113
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
preserving our legacy as Wayuu through
of your teachings

114
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
We of the new generation

115
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The children who are in the town

116
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It is difficult for them

117
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Know about this

118
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That is why there are few people who have the knowledge

119
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And with this what was said is recorded

120
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Because if they forget their origin,

121
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
they would be on earth without any direction

122
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
They wouldn't know where they come from, it's what they call loss of origin

123
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
On the other hand, with this and the Wolunka stone, it is something that
gives them identity as they say

124
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It is what identifies them and what authenticates the culture

125
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Thank you very much teacher.

126
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That's all

127
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
not what he told us is the mythological origin

128
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and a reflection about how this gives us identity

129
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
even though it has

130
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Its origin also has a non-Wayuu antecedent.

131
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Why not wayuu?

132
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Because the origin of the clans was given to animals,

133
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's a practice of, oh well, I get it.

134
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
From there one got the idea, or we adopted it because
Those symbols are Wayuu

135
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Hey, can you give me a photo session? Because

136
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I feel like I'm not going to be late again,
because here they do allow us to record

137
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Even with the drone, you can because this is not in the park.

138
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Do you want me to tell you the explanation?

139
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Well, your symbol is there, my symbol is here

140
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
this

141
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Wait I just lost it

142
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's here, here

143
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Where is my symbol.

144
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Epiayu

145
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Uriana
You can do that with the other hand please.

146
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Aapushana

147
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Pushaina

148
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And Magalys

149
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Pausayu, Magalys's is over here.

150
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Girnu

151
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Jusayu

152
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And what is that of your ancestors?

153
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I have two ancestors

154
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Which is it? wait, I think it's this

155
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And this, these two

156
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yes this one and this one, Epieyu

157
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
AND

158
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This.
Uriana

159
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Well, they have mythological origins, part of orality

160
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What makes

161
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Measuring time is difficult.

162
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But this rock.

163
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
My grandfather told me about

164
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
if my grandfather counted

165
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
that he listened

166
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
that Wuimpumiun, the upper Guajira

167
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
he never saw him,

168
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
but his grandfather told him

169
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So for me to get here, it's practically too,
touches on many topics

170
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
of life, of my personal life,

171
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
because many of my family, the Wayuu there are

172
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
that have been or have been going down, have been displacing

173
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
They talk about this rock,

174
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
They talk about this rock as that place

175
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
where some moment from which this culture starts.

176
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Remember that I told you that in our culture

177
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
We came down from the mountains of the serranía
that crosses Colombia

178
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Starting from the peninsula we settle

179
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and from there we went down to La Guajira Baja now

180
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
During hours

181
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But those from there are still in the collective memory of these places

182
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Now there is the Aalatsü stone that I have seen
hundreds of times in books

183
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I had longed to arrive, I had longed

184
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
touch that energy that exists, if one touches it
There is tremendous energy.

185
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What do you suppose that day or that time was like to mark this here?
everyone gathered here deciding the clans

186
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
how do you imagine it?

187
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Well, the teacher said that Maleiwa
the supreme being of the Wayuu.

188
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
He needed his children to divide into groups

189
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
because we were like this

190
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So it was very difficult, in the organization, to have
a standard at least

191
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and that is why it was necessary for them to become clans

192
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
so that the Wayuu group has
small groups, that is, of the large group there are subgroups

193
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It is a fabric, the social fabric of culture.

194
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Our culture is in a group, but within the
group there are micro groups

18:34 18:36
and for the election

195
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Maleiwa listened because at that

196
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
in that mythological time of our creation

197
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The animals were people,

198
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
the bird was a person and they heard the different birds and it was

199
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
There was a bird that said wuinpumiu, wuinpumui, what the teacher said

200
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
North, north

201
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Maleiwa heard that, but it didn't catch his attention.

202
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Then there was another one that said ojutusu, ojutusu, fall, falling

203
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
When the birds sing, each one emits a message, no,

204
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But among those birds is the wise bird, which is the utta which is
Let's say the bird that represents the palabrero.

205
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,000
This bird in its song said Epieyu, said Pushaina, Uriana,
Jusayu, Pausayu

206
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Maleiwa heard that, he repeated that.

207
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And Maleiwa said, he is saying some words that could well
Be what each divided group represents.

208
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And from Utta's song, the
the names of the different clans.

209
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Thus we have Uriana, which is a clan that has a totem and has

210
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
an animal that represents it and in this case
It also has a symbol that must be on this rock

211
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
How good it is on this rock, we find it here in that little part.

212
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
but also the Epieyu which is my clan that is right here

213
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Here

214
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And then seeing that we realize that here
impregnated the oral ideas

215
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
to materialize the idea in a way.
You know that all ideas are first a thought,

216
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
but then they materialize

217
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And maybe, like here where possibly

218
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
time has already taken several from us because in itself,
It is said that there are 32 clans,

219
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
but currently only about 22 are recorded

220
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And then what happened to other clans? Maybe

221
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
communities or those clan groups have been

222
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
involved in other clans.

223
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
This happens for different reasons, there are many reasons,
are in conflicts between the same communities

224
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
When one family is in conflict with another,
always seeks to completely disappear the lineage

225
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And how do they disappear? Cutting the matrilineal line

226
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Other.

227
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Another reason you could also make a clan disappear

228
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It could be the need to migrate to the cities.

229
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Many communities migrated to the cities and being in
the cities, lost part of that knowledge of knowledge

230
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
and maybe they also lost their clan there

231
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
because they didn't talk about it anymore, so if they didn't
They talk about their clan, the other clans are not going to do it.

232
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and that is why it is said that many clans
Many clans have been lost, yes.
