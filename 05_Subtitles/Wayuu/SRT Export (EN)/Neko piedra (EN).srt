1
00:03 --> 00:06
We meet at the alatsu stone

2
00:07 --> 00:10
with an ancient stone that dates back many years,

3
00:11 --> 00:14
that from our own worldview we can look from what,

4
00:15 --> 00:16
from the mythological.

00:17: - 00:21
They say that once Maleiwa, the god of the Wayúu,

5
00:22 --> 00:23
came down in this place

6
00:24 --> 00:29
because he was worried about the situation in what
the Wayúu were found

7
00:30 --> 00:34
because they had no way to identify themselves within Wayuu society.

8
00:35 --> 00:39
So he decided to organize a contest with the birds.

9
00:40 --> 00:49
That was where the curlew was, that was where the Zamuro was, there was the
bird they call Pico Gordo, the Utta (dotted bobito)

10
00:50 --> 00:53
So he decided to organize that contest

11
00:54 --> 00:56
to choose

12
00:58 --> 01:01
something that would identify the Wayúu people.

13
01:02 --> 01:05
Then Cataneja began to sing and began to sing.

14
01:06 --> 01:08
Toulijana, toulijana, toulijana (anklet)

15
01:09 --> 01:11
Maleiwa did not like the Cataneja song

16
01:12 --> 01:15
Toulijana means that which hangs on the ankles.

17
01:16 --> 01:18
And then they called Walusechi

18
01:19 --> 01:22
and began to sing son'tusu to'i, son'tusu toi, son'tusu

19
01:23 --> 01:25
my feet are cramping, is the translation

20
01:26 --> 01:30
and Maleiwa did not like the song of the two birds.

21
01:31 --> 01:37
And then Utta, who is the bird, entered
fat beak and began to sing

22
01:38 --> 01:40
Pushaina with Arpushana, Ipuana with Epieyu.

23
01:41 --> 01:49
Sapuana with Ipuana, he began to sing mentioning
those striking words.

24
01:50 --> 01:53
Then Maleiwa (God) said, I do like that, I do like this.

25
01:54 --> 01:55
Let's choose

26
01:56 --> 01:57
that phrase, those words that

27
01:58 --> 02:01
that you sang in the song, Pushaina with Arpushana

28
02:02 --> 02:08
Ipuana with Epieyu, Sapuana with Ulewana. He highlighted all of those

29
02:09 --> 02:10
So from there

30
02:11 --> 02:13
Maleiwa began to distribute to each Wayúu family,

31
02:14 --> 02:17
which are the respective clans, with their respective brand

32
02:18 --> 02:22
and in what is now embodied in stone,

33
02:23 --> 02:26
that from the mythological part.

34
02:26 --> 02:31
Now, if we go back in history

35
02:32 --> 02:36
we can realize that the word Jeerü

36
02:37 --> 02:40
In wayunaiki (wayuu language) it comes from herraje

37
02:41 --> 02:43
Jeerü comes from horseshoe.

38
02:44 --> 02:48
We know very well that livestock farming is not typical of the Wayúu,

39
02:49 --> 02:51
but they were brought by the colony.

40
02:52 --> 02:56
So what is the cow, what is the goat

41
02:57 --> 03:00
They are not our own, but we as a Wayuu people

42
03:01 --> 03:04
We adopt it and give it a name,

43
03:05 --> 03:07
we use the label

44
03:08 --> 03:11
like Jeerü , which is horseshoe

45
03:12 --> 03:17
also the words, if we can analyze ourselves
the ear cutting of animals.

46
03:18 --> 03:23
It comes from asu'araluja which is the word in wayunaiki
or point in Spanish

47
03:24 --> 03:30
There is no original word of its own that comes from
Wayúu people, but it was a product

48
03:31 --> 03:34
of Spanish domination when they brought us livestock

49
03:35 --> 03:36
and we realize.

50
03:37 --> 03:39
But the Wayúu, since he is so creative,

51
03:40 --> 03:43
It is a town that adapts, that adjusts

52
03:44 --> 03:46
to all the circumstances,

53
03:47 --> 03:53
He captured it in his myth and we adopted it as our origin,

54
03:53 --> 03:56
about the symbology of the Wayuu people,

55
03:57 --> 03:59
That's what the oral tradition tells,

56
04:13 --> 04:19
Yes, of course, that is the rock that tells the origins
of the Wayuu people.

57
04:21 --> 04:23
Well, this is the stone of Alatsu,

58
04:24 --> 04:27
which tells about the origins of the clans,

59
04:28 --> 04:30
What clans are, it's like a

60
04:31 --> 04:34
classification within Wayuu society

61
04:35 --> 04:41
There are around 22 clans currently, but
Previously there were other clans.

62
04:42 --> 04:48
We can give an approximate of 32 clans that existed
previously,

63
04:49 --> 04:53
but that, due to various circumstances, due to problems
of inter claníles

64
04:54 --> 05:03
many of those clans disappeared and became extinct
for some, some war

65
05:04 --> 05:06
and due to various circumstances
Those clans disappeared.

66
05:07 --> 05:10
But currently there are 22 clans in force.

67
05:11 --> 05:17
which are what is currently and are present
throughout the department of La Guajira.

68
06:12 --> 06:17
Well teacher, I come from Alkualü, Manaure

69
06:21 --> 06:23
To learn more about the culture, and where

70
06:25 --> 06:30
It comes from the story that our
ancestors about our symbols

71
06:38 --> 06:42
So, for you to tell me again, but in wayunaiki

72
06:44 --> 06:48
About God, yes, that started from
maleiwa concern

73
06:49 --> 06:55
He felt sad, because people were
disorganized, they looked like animals

74
06:56 --> 07:02
There was no organization or structure that
classify families

75
07:03 --> 07:07
So that's where the birds called,
like the buzzard, like utta

76
07:11 --> 07:16
and others, like them or the birds, were before people, yes, true.

77
07:17 --> 07:22
So he decided to have a singing contest.
to choose the best

78
07:25 --> 07:29
Since the names they choose will remain as a legacy
to future generations

79
07:30 --> 07:32
They will be your family lineages

80
07:33 --> 07:36
Then the other sang and he didn't like it,
the other one too and he didn't like it either

81
07:37 --> 07:40
The only song he liked was Utta's

82
07:41 --> 07:48
He liked the words Pushaina, Ipuana, Epieyu
God liked all the ones he mentioned

83
07:49 --> 07:50
for the song

84
07:51 --> 07:57
Its reward was a necklace, which is why the bird has
a line down his neck, yes.

85
07:58 --> 08:02
Yes, that was his reward, it was like his payment

86
08:04 --> 08:10
How interesting to know that the bloodlines came out
of a bird's song

87
08:11 --> 08:13
If it was Utta, and how did he sing?

88
08:14 --> 08:21
That same one, wayuu said Epieyu, Pushaina, Epinayu Ipuana Uriana

89
08:23 --> 08:25
So from there the eirüku (family lineage) arose.

90
08:26 --> 08:33
I am Epieyu. What is your professional lineage? Uriana, wayuu
Uriana, from the cat or tiger

91
08:34 --> 08:39
If each one was given an animal to represent them
as the stone shows

92
08:40 --> 08:48
If each group was told, this is going to be your lineage,
you will be Pushaina, you will be Ipuana, Sapuana

93
08:49 --> 08:53
And which is the Uriana here? It's over here, where?

94
08:57 --> 08:58
Uriana, Uriana

95
09:01 --> 09:04
Here is the Epieyu, Pushaina, Epieyu

96
09:05 --> 09:09
Is this Epieyu? Yes, well this is my lineage, yes.
My mother is Epieyu

97
09:10 --> 09:16
Because, ah look this is my eirüku (lineage) Urina,
yes , the one with a head

98
09:17 --> 09:26
Where I come from, in Akualü, Manaure the Uriana
They are my grandfathers and grandmothers so you are my grandfather

99
09:27 --> 09:29
And look here they are together

100
09:30 --> 09:36
It is one of the oldest lineages in the
which ones come off others

101
09:38 --> 09:43
There are many, there is the Jusayu, there is the Sapuana

102
09:44 --> 09:46
The Pausayu that is from Magalys

103
09:49 --> 09:50
How interesting

104
09:53 --> 09:57
So it was formed then, I saw it only in leaves

105
09:58 --> 09:59
In pictures

106
10:01 --> 10:04
That's how I saw it, but I'm here to know

107
10:05 --> 10:10
because there are many people who brag about
being Wayuu and they don't know anything about the culture

108
10:11 --> 10:12
Instead

109
10:13 --> 10:21
I can say from now on that I know the origin of
our ancestors and this stone

110
10:22 --> 10:26
Now I know that it was Utta who stipulated this, who created it

111
10:27 --> 10:34
Because I only knew that he was a talker but not wise
that I name the lineages

112
10:35 --> 10:37
Well teacher, thanks for continuing

113
10:39 --> 10:43
preserving our legacy as Wayuu through
of your teachings

114
10:44 --> 10:46
We of the new generation

115
10:48 --> 10:51
The children who are in the town

116
10:52 --> 10:54
It is difficult for them

117
10:55 --> 10:56
Know about this

118
10:57 --> 11:03
That is why there are few people who have the knowledge

119
11:04 --> 11:07
And with this what was said is recorded

120
11:08 --> 11:11
Because if they forget their origin,

121
11:12 --> 11:14
they would be on earth without any direction

122
11:15 --> 11:20
They wouldn't know where they come from, it's what they call loss of origin

123
11:21 --> 11:28
On the other hand, with this and the Wolunka stone, it is something that
gives them identity as they say

124
11:29 --> 11:34
It is what identifies them and what authenticates the culture

125
11:35 --> 11:36
Thank you very much teacher.

126
11:38 --> 11:39
That's all

127
11:42 --> 11:46
not what he told us is the mythological origin

128
11:47 --> 11:52
and a reflection about how this gives us identity

129
11:53 --> 11:55
even though it has

130
11:56 --> 12:01
Its origin also has a non-Wayuu antecedent.

131
12:02 --> 12:03
Why not wayuu?

132
12:04 --> 12:07
Because the origin of the clans was given to animals,

133
12:08 --> 12:11
That's a practice of, oh well, I get it.

134
12:11 --> 12:16
From there one got the idea, or we adopted it because
Those symbols are Wayuu

135
12:20 --> 12:23
Hey, can you give me a photo session? Because

136
12:25 --> 12:29
I feel like I'm not going to be late again,
because here they do allow us to record

137
12:30 --> 12:33
Even with the drone, you can because this is not in the park.

138
12:44 --> 12:46
Do you want me to tell you the explanation?

139
12:44 --> 12:50
Well, your symbol is there, my symbol is here

140
12:52 --> 12:53
this

141
12:54 --> 12:56
Wait I just lost it

142
13:07 --> 13:10
It's here, here

143
13:17 --> 13:19
Where is my symbol.

144
14:12 --> 14:13
Epiayu

145
14:17 --> 14:20
Uriana
You can do that with the other hand please.

146
14:26 --> 14:27
Aapushana

147
14:31 --> 14:32
Pushaina

148
14:34 --> 14:35
And Magalys

149
14:36 --> 14:39
Pausayu, Magalys's is over here.

150
14:50 --> 14:51
Girnu

151
14:56 --> 14:57
Jusayu

152
15:07 --> 15:09
And what is that of your ancestors?

153
15:11 --> 15:13
I have two ancestors

154
15:18 --> 15:20
Which is it? wait, I think it's this

155
15:23 --> 15:24
And this, these two

156
15:27 --> 15:29
Yes this one and this one, Epieyu

157
15:32 --> 15:33
AND

158
15:34 --> 15:36
This.
Uriana

159
16:00 --> 16:06
Well, they have mythological origins, part of orality

160
16:07 --> 16:08
What makes

161
16:09 --> 16:12
Measuring time is difficult.

162
16:13 --> 16:14
But this rock.

163
16:17 --> 16:18
My grandfather told me about

164
16:20 --> 16:21
if my grandfather counted

165
16:22 --> 16:23
that he listened

166
16:24 --> 16:26
that Wuimpumiun, the upper Guajira

167
16:27 --> 16:28
he never saw him,

168
16:30 --> 16:32
but his grandfather told him

169
16:33 --> 16:37
So for me to get here, it's practically too,
touches on many topics

170
16:38 --> 16:41
of life, of my personal life,

171
16:42 --> 16:45
because many of my family, the Wayuu there are

172
16:47 --> 16:51
that have been or have been going down, have been displacing

173
16:53 --> 16:54
They talk about this rock,

174
16:55 --> 16:58
They talk about this rock as that place

175
16:59 --> 17:02
where some moment from which this culture starts.

176
17:03 --> 17:05
Remember that I told you that in our culture

177
17:06 --> 17:10
We came down from the mountains of the serranía
that crosses Colombia

178
17:11 --> 17:13
Starting from the peninsula we settle

179
17:14 --> 17:17
and from there we went down to La Guajira Baja now

180
17:18 --> 17:19
During hours

181
17:20 --> 17:25
But those from there are still in the collective memory of these places

182
17:26 --> 17:30
Now there is the Aalatsü stone that I have seen
hundreds of times in books

183
17:31 --> 17:34
I had longed to arrive, I had longed

184
17:35 --> 17:39
touch that energy that exists, if one touches it
There is tremendous energy.

185
17:42 --> 17:49
What do you suppose that day or that time was like to mark this here?
everyone gathered here deciding the clans

186
17:50 --> 17:52
how do you imagine it?

187
17:53 --> 17:58
Well, the teacher said that Maleiwa
the supreme being of the Wayuu.

188
18:00 --> 18:04
He needed his children to divide into groups

189
18:05 --> 18:06
because we were like this

190
18:08 --> 18:13
So it was very difficult, in the organization, to have
a standard at least

191
18:14 --> 18:16
and that is why it was necessary for them to become clans

192
18:17 --> 18:24
so that the Wayuu group has
small groups, that is, of the large group there are subgroups

193
18:25 --> 18:28
It is a fabric, the social fabric of culture.

194
18:29 --> 18:32
Our culture is in a group, but within the
group there are micro groups

18:34 18:36
and for the election

195
18:37 --> 18:41
Maleiwa listened because at that

196
18:43 --> 18:45
in that mythological time of our creation

197
18:47 --> 18:48
The animals were people,

198
18:49 --> 18:55
the bird was a person and they heard the different birds and it was

199
18:56 --> 19:01
There was a bird that said wuinpumiu, wuinpumui, what the teacher said

200
19:02 --> 19:03
North, north

201
19:04 --> 19:07
Maleiwa heard that, but it didn't catch his attention.

202
19:08 --> 19:12
Then there was another one that said ojutusu, ojutusu, fall, falling

203
19:13 --> 19:18
When the birds sing, each one emits a message, no,

204
19:19 --> 19:26
But among those birds is the wise bird, which is the utta which is
Let's say the bird that represents the palabrero.

205
19:27 --> 19:35
This bird in its song said Epieyu, said Pushaina, Uriana,
Jusayu, Pausayu

206
19:37 --> 19:40
Maleiwa heard that, he repeated that.

207
19:41 --> 19:50
And Maleiwa said, he is saying some words that could well
Be what each divided group represents.

208
19:51 --> 19:58
And from Utta's song, the
the names of the different clans.

209
19:59 --> 20:03
Thus we have Uriana, which is a clan that has a totem and has

210
20:04 --> 20:10
an animal that represents it and in this case
It also has a symbol that must be on this rock

211
20:11 --> 20:15
How good it is on this rock, we find it here in that little part.

212
20:16 --> 20:20
but also the Epieyu which is my clan that is right here

213
20:21 --> 20:22
Here

214
20:23 --> 20:28
And then seeing that we realize that here
impregnated the oral ideas

215
20:30 --> 20:35
to materialize the idea in a way.
You know that all ideas are first a thought,

216
20:37 --> 20:38
but then they materialize

217
20:39 --> 20:43
And maybe, like here where possibly

218
20:45 --> 20:51
time has already taken several from us because in itself,
It is said that there are 32 clans,

219
20:52 --> 20:55
but currently only about 22 are recorded

220
20:56 --> 20:59
And then what happened to other clans? Maybe

221
21:00 --> 21:03
communities or those clan groups have been

222
21:05 --> 21:07
involved in other clans.

223
21:08 --> 21:13
This happens for different reasons, there are many reasons,
are in conflicts between the same communities

224
21:14 --> 21:20
When one family is in conflict with another,
always seeks to completely disappear the lineage

225
21:21 --> 21:23
And how do they disappear? Cutting the matrilineal line

226
21:24 --> 21:05
Other.

227
21:26 --> 21:29
Another reason you could also make a clan disappear

228
21:30 --> 21:33
It could be the need to migrate to the cities.

229
21:34 --> 21:40
Many communities migrated to the cities and being in
the cities, lost part of that knowledge of knowledge

230
21:41 --> 21:45
and maybe they also lost their clan there

231
21:46 --> 21:50
because they didn't talk about it anymore, so if they didn't
They talk about their clan, the other clans are not going to do it.

232
21:51 --> 21:58
and that is why it is said that many clans
Many clans have been lost, yes.
