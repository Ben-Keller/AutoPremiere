1
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:24,125
Well, I have been asking you a lot about the Wayúu people,

2
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:27,458
but you personally

3
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:30,750
in what ways do you interact

4
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,875
with nature, that is, with humans

5
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:40,416
or is there a river or a tree down there that you connect with?

6
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:45,000
Well this city is called “Río de la Hacha” (Ax River)

7
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:49,166
and this is the river, in wayuunaiki it is said suchi'i,

8
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,833
It is the most important river in La Guajira,

9
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,583
perhaps the only one in the Wayúu territory,

10
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:00,666
which has many streams that dry up in summer,

11
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:04,083
but this is the most important river of the Wayuú.

12
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,333
and Ríohacha for the Wayúu is called Suchima,

13
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,500
This is a serpent river, a path river.

14
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,708
It is linked to the stories of the Wayuú

15
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:16,708
and on the way to the interior of the continent.

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,666
It has the story of a snake

17
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:23,458
that marks its course in each rainy season.

18
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,500
That snake is called jerakanauwa

19
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:31,250
and many Wayúu settlements are along this river.

20
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:36,791
From the middle course of Distracción in the south of La Güajira

21
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,625
to the mouth here in Riohacha, where it forms

22
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:44,291
a Delta with the sea and where there is a lot of bird life

23
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:49,333
pelicans, cormorants and formerly alligators.

24
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:53,375
And it is a river of many tales for the Wayuú.

25
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,916
Also, a kind of living being

26
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:01,250
that generates a way of life, the way of life of the river

27
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,250
and that has a forest that gives fruits

28
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,750
and that also gives food,

29
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,500
fish and other types of food.

30
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:09,916
Therefore,

31
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,916
this river is key in giving its name to this city

32
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,291
which is Riohacha.

33
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,041
It has been its story

34
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:19,791
over time and this river originates in the Sierra Nevada,

35
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:20,333
where there are

36
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,125
the Kogis indigenous people and the Wiwas other indigenous peoples,

37
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,541
who also have many stories about the river.

38
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,875
So, in some way these rivers are a path and are memory,

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
memory of all the people who live along it.

40
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,708
Shocking and the river too

41
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,708
is used as a mode of transportation, I guess.

42
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,958
Well, he is navigable only in the lower part,

43
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:48,083
only in this lower area, but

44
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,583
Only canoes were used to get from one shore to the other.

45
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,750
In Wayúu Riohacha is called suchimalü, suchima

46
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,666
which was like a river that goes into the earth.

47
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:02,375
That's good.

48
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,125
And then, talking about this river

49
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:32,625
and the stories he has as a being

50
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,875
Living , can you tell me a little more about that?

51
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,958
What is the river like?

52
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,041
in relation to the people there,

53
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,416
of the Wayuú?

54
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,833
The river generates games, games for children,

55
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,416
the Alligator game.

56
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,083
There is a game called Trapiche, which

57
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,291
It's like spinning around a river tree,

58
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,750
water games in which they

59
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,750
they raise the water with their foot, among the children

60
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,791
They have a game called sombreros (hats),

61
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,416
which is like touching and hiding in the water.

62
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,083
They have many games

63
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,541
and they are spaces where shaman women

64
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,666
collect plants for healing,

65
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,166
where women go to wash clothes from the river,

66
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,166
where young Wayuú couples fall in love,

67
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,333
also on the river bank.

68
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,333
Generates a catch at certain times of the year

69
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:29,833
and generates a great relationship with the river's own forest.

70
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,458
He changes,

71
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,500
from stones and almost transparent up there,

72
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:39,375
until it gradually descends to the Caribbean.

73
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,958
It is about 250 kilometers long,

74
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,666
but it is a river that gives meaning

75
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:49,291
to the territory in La Guajira, orders the territory.

76
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,875
That is why it is so important.

77
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,291
And when it reaches Riohacha it forms a delta,

78
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,416
This is one of the arms, but there are three more

79
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,833
in that direction, where there is a lot of life.

80
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,125
crabs, oysters,

81
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:05,125
there were alligators before and anyway,

82
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,333
structures the territory.

83
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,125
Very important

84
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:12,375
then for entertainment, for experience.

85
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,791
for humans and…
Of course

86
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:19,833
And the road, he was called a river road because following

87
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,833
the course of it, you reach the throat

88
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,000
between the Sierra Nevada

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,500
and the Serranía del Perijá,

90
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,833
as inside what is now Colombia.

91
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,916
This is the way, follow the river.

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,166
Union.

93
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,166
And you as a child,

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,375
did you grow up here in Riohacha?

95
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,791
Yes, between Riohacha and Carrizal is my original land,

96
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:44,750
but I studied here

97
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,875
and therefore the river was very important.

98
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:50,166
I saw the last alligator in the river killed when I

99
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,708
I was like, seven years old, everyone ran away.

100
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:57,166
And here, in this place, here where we are, 20 meters away,

101
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,750
They hung that alligator.

They hung it?

102
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:04,541
Yes, that's how they showed it, it had a salmon-colored stomach.

103
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,250
and it was big, perhaps it was the last alligator that was in the river.

104
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,541
Why did they kill him?

105
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,541
We don't know, because it's full of alligators.

106
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,375
And do you remember the last alligator?

107
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,625
The very last.

108
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,625
Wow, that’s a story!

109
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,083
Yeah

110
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,875
and the river

111
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:46,250
as a living being, how does he express himself?

112
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,375
On the riverbed,

113
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,666
in every rainy season

114
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,166
he can change his path,

115
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,750
but at the same time he has a hierarchy.

116
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,625
There are the small streams that feed it,

117
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,375
the streams are

118
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:06,166
They are like other arms of the river and the river has a bottom

119
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,666
and the Wayúu know and organize it by bottoms,

120
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,000
where the bottom is sand,

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,750
where the bottom is stone,

122
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,458
where the bottom is tree roots, where

123
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,458
The bottom is ravines and where the bottom is mud.

124
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,791
This is how the Wayúu categorize the course of the river,

125
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,791
because of the type of bottom it has below,

126
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,666
if it is sand, mud, stone, root.

127
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,416
And does it have different characteristics?

128
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,041
Different in each place.

129
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,791
And does it also have any kind of souls, like you’re saying,

130
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:35,833
at different times?

131
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:41,375
Yes, many myths talk about him, they talk about snakes

132
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,208
that follow him, of a bull that lives within him.

133
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:49,125
They call that snake doroy in some places, in others

134
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,583
they call him jerakanawa,

135
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:55,291
and the songs and stories are given across the river.

136
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:56,583
many songs,

137
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,208
many stories that have to do

138
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,708
with the river as a space.

139
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,291
And that tells me a little about

140
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:08,000
What is the significance of music and dance among the Wayuú?

141
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,916
Music is something that was given to us.

142
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,666
Music is something that more than a human invention,

143
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,666
It is a legacy of non-humans.

144
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:23,125
From the turtle, then the drum, the curlew played it.

145
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:27,875
The trees that were musicians give us flutes,

146
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,083
the wood from which they are built

147
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,166
the musical instruments.

148
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,333
Music

149
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,333
occurs in sociability,

150
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:40,583
When dancing, dances, but it can also be given for grazing.

151
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,166
The drum speaks to the Wayúu, it lifts their spirits

152
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,625
and they listen to it for a horse race,

153
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,625
mark the cattle, for a party,

154
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,625
for a dance for a girl's release from confinement.

155
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:56,333
There are many forms of the drum, but the drum speaks

156
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,500
and every drum performer

157
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,875
has a characteristic sound that makes it identifiable

158
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,875
differently from others.

159
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,625
It serves to make a woman fall in love,

160
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,500
the drum, which was previously the turtle

161
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,500
terrestrial, was the first executor of that.

162
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,958
The birds left us rhetoric

163
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,500
and harmony in speech,

164
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,708
that sounds like music too,

165
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,416
That is the legacy of birds.

166
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:27,083
The palabreros are descendants of birds, the good ones

167
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,166
palavers because persuasive speech

168
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,958
It must be a seductive song to change behavior

169
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,458
of human beings,

170
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,750
that's the role.

171
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,750
So, music and words are very linked,

172
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,250
but there is also harvest festival music,

173
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,416
games,

174
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,041
like the kaulayawa,

175
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:48,041
which are dances and harvest games,

176
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:53,833
so the Sawawa, the Maashi, the Uotoroyoi.

177
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,833
the Taliraai which is a vocal bow,

178
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:02,541
the Kasha or drum, the maraca that the Wayúu woman plays,

179
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,541
the shaman, allows her to ascend

180
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,583
towards the spirits

181
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,333
where they are located and find the assistance.

182
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,333
Then the music helps the shaman to heal and raise

183
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,333
to seek auxiliary spirits for connection.

184
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:18,666
That's it

185
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,750
a very important role.
Definitely.

186
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:25,958
And something we haven't talked about yet is dance.

187
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,041
and dancing, what does it have to do with it?

188
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,916
dancing with the Wayúu people?

189
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,250
The Wayúu have

190
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,333
at least two dances that are very important.

191
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,375
The Kaa'ulayawaa that is on the verge of extinction,

192
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:44,083
that lasted days and days during the youth’s harvests,

193
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,375
which is more numerous and has games.

194
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,500
And the Yonna, is a ritual dance that is played

195
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,500
with the drum when a dream occurs,

196
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,791
Or to celebrate the end of confinement for a girl

197
00:11:56,791 --> 00:12:00,333
who is already a woman, with a prescription from a female shaman or

198
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:05,166
a shaman man. It is a ritual dance that mimes

199
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,166
of insects,

200
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:11,166
a mimesis of birds, for example,

201
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,541
and that the Wayúu man and women

202
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,375
perform during festive times.

203
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,291
Her name is Yonna.

204
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,750
Is that what we saw on Friday?

205
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,458
On Friday they saw more of a Kaa'ulayawaa.

206
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,041
I like how you started talking about the river.

207
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:41,041
But I had also asked you about how

208
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,625
maybe it's the river.

209
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:46,625
Is there a non-human person that you have

210
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:50,541
a strong connection with, or a place?

211
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,958
A place, yes.

212
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,250
There is a place called Pajara Turtles

213
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,375
in Carrizal,

214
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,791
where in the desert there are some rocks.

215
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,375
Those rocks were the cattle,

216
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,125
They are turtles that came out of the sea

217
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,500
and they became cattle.

218
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,916
The Wayuú took cattle from the sea.

219
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,666
They were turtles that transformed into cows,

220
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,250
certain fish in goats and sheep,

221
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,875
and that is why the Wayúu have cattle.

222
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,500
The origin of cattle for the Wayúu is there.

223
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,666
One day

224
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,666
that the Wayúu took over the cattle,

225
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,708
some turtles did not make it to the Sea

226
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,833
and the sun rose and turned them into rocks.

227
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,041
and in the distance

228
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,041
It looks like cattle trying to return to the sea,

229
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,000
it's a mirage

230
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,291
In the desert, it looks like water and the rocks look like cattle.

231
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,458
That place is called the Pajara turtles,

232
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,250
but there are many other places, the Aalasü stone,

233
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,291
where are the emblems

234
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:52,833
of all the members of each clan in La Guajira,

235
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,500
It is a key place in Wayúu mythology.

236
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,125
This wososopu, there is Wolunka

237
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:04,291
the chair where she sang, the woman with the vagina dentata.

238
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,166
The Wayúu world is full of mythological places,

239
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,250
all with a very strong and imposing presence that

240
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,250
When you arrive you feel in a solemn place,

241
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,583
in a place that condenses time and memory.

242
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,625
Those are places

243
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,166
who have a

244
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,166
narrative structure and that tell us about the

245
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,666
history.

246
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:28,416
It always feels calm, this is so nice

247
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,625
here

248
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:30,833
the river.

249
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,750
Sadly it’s a bit dirty

250
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,500
it could be cleaner.

251
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Yes, to respect the river more,

252
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,833
but the city is like that.

253
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,416
How do you see that?

254
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,958
That clash between modernity

255
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,333
and the Wayúu people,

256
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,916
That betrayal, how do you see it

257
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,000
Interviewer] in the future? How are we doing?

258
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,791
I think that the Wayúu have known

259
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:03,208
respond to many changes since the 15th century,

260
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,666
when they encountered Europeans.

261
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,458
In the XVI, XVII,

262
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,125
They acquired the cattle, the firearms,

263
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,166
The horse,

264
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,875
came into conflictive or harmonious contact,

265
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,833
sometimes with Europeans, with Africans,

266
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,458
and they have given an answer over time

267
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,166
to survive.

268
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,916
Every era,

269
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,916
Every century, every decade, brings challenges to the Wayuú.

270
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,458
Now they have others that are typical of this era.

271
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,000
So far they have been able to respond to that,

272
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,958
sometimes paying a very high cost in human lives,

273
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,000
in poverty, in loss of autonomy.

274
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,375
I trust that the Wayúu will remain over time.

275
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,375
There is a more complex universe

276
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,333
than that of their elders.

277
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:13,041
Yes, well,

278
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,458
tell me again.

279
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,458
What river is this?

280
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,333
Ranchería River.This river is called Ranchería River,

281
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,333
It is the most important river in La Güajira.

282
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,166
and that's why

283
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,041
is it called Riohacha?

284
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:33,416
Yes, Riohacha is due to this river.

285
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:34,375
Ok.

286
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:36,375
Well,

287
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,375
Can you tell me a little about,

288
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:44,166
an intimate relationship of

289
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:50,000
yours with that place or with that river or the sea or the wind

290
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,291
here?
Yeah.

291
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,208
Well, our childhood passed here.

292
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,541
There in

293
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,541
That’s the school and the river and the sea,

294
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,958
that at that time when I was a child,

295
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,500
There only was had indigenous canoes.

296
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,916
It's what you saw from the windows

297
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,666
wayúu fishermen crossing the sea

298
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,250
with small engines, engines

299
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,250
very simple, very simple or sailing.

300
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:16,208
And well,

301
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:16,708
this river

302
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,708
marks the life of the city just like the Caribbean.

303
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,500
The sea is very important

304
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,500
in the Wayúu world.

305
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,958
Apalanchi means one who lives by the sea.

306
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,791
But Apalaanchi that is also used,

307
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:37,375
It means the one who has his heart turned towards the sea,

308
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,916
like the Wayúu fishermen, whose world

309
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,875
is the sea and whose territory is the sea

310
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,916
and its relationship is with marine beings, turtles, groupers,

311
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,791
sharks, barracudas,

312
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,750
clams, oysters, shrimp.

313
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,458
All that series of beings,

314
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:02,166
each of whom have a different personality.

315
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,208
When the Wayuú

316
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,333
Find fish cardumen that are marching,

317
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,041
The Wayuú call it veloriantes (mourners),

318
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:15,041
because they march together,

319
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:18,041
Just as the human wayúu go to funerals

320
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:21,250
In multitude, they too march across the sea,

321
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,125
in that multitude as well.

322
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:26,125
And there are fixed fish that have houses,

323
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,541
Fish such as the

324
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,958
grouper who live in

325
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,958
reefs, near corals, in stony areas

326
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:37,333
and there are other fish that are walkers that do not have houses,

327
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,916
They are wanderers of the sea. One of those fish is the shark

328
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,083
that wanders through the sea.

329
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:46,875
But others, like horse mackerel, also roam the sea.

330
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,916
There are others like locusts, like certain

331
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:54,250
scorpion fish that live in areas

332
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,708
fixed, which are called beings with a house in the sea,

333
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,708
that they have a place to live.

334
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,500
That is.

335
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,208
Everything has a similar name.

336
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,583
They are metaphors, a social metaphor.

337
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,500
That's right, that's right. And

338
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,958
is there something between the water

339
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:16,458
fresh and salt water?
The estuary.

340
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,333
The estuary that takes place

341
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:22,083
in a river mouth, in the estuary, in the Ranchería delta,

342
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,625
where there’s fresh water and salty water,

343
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:28,291
there are coastal lagoons and there are a series of beings.

344
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,250
They find shrimp in those lagoons,

345
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,083
certain fish like the lebranche,

346
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,708
The Liza, which are costume fish and the Wayúu know it

347
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,708
and they collect it and have lived for centuries

348
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,125
Out of those resources, of their knowledge of the periods

349
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,583
in which they arise, in which they are abundant and so

350
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,000
They’re part of

351
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
their economic calendar, of their social life.

352
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,208
And this wind is so strong, right?

353
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:59,166
This wind is northeast.

354
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,875
this wind

355
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:05,166
He is a loving father who softens the temperature of the water.

356
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,208
It's called Jepírachi,

357
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:07,916
It's a wind

358
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,375
northeast trade and always comes in that direction.

359
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,375
It is the predominant wind of the Wayuú

360
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,250
and it is a wind

361
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,208
which has a different character from other winds.

362
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,333
The Wayuú distinguish the wind from the north,

363
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,250
to this northeast wind,

364
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,708
to a false wind

365
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,333
what passes for this wind

366
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,291
to deceive the fishermen.

367
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:32,625
Jo'utai a wind that comes from the east and brings hunger,

368
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:36,416
Drought, is an evil wind. Aruleeshi is another wind,

369
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,291
There is the road’s wind from and there are other winds.

370
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,833
Every wind has a character,

371
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:45,166
a temperament and a relationship with the Wayuú, and the winds

372
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:48,250
They have antagonisms between them, they can fight,

373
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,041
They can have friendly relations,

374
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,500
They are people who have paths

375
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,041
and that's what companies don't understand.

376
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:59,041
Like, what is the path of the winds

377
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,666
and what is the character of the winds.

378
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,666
And here you can see the wind, the character,

379
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:08,125
you can see how he is talking.

380
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,458
Yes, Yes. Well,

381
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:14,166
Father of the Wayúu fishermen, the father is this wind.

382
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,458
Jepirachi, the father.

383
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,666
And is there anything else you would like to share?

384
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,666
Well, no. It was that.

385
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,166
I think that

386
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,166
what we have talked about about the sea, the wind, the river.

387
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,666
Great.

388
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,916
Well.

389
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,458
One more thing.

390
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,125
Of all those relationships,

391
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,125
Is there some spirituality too, with

392
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,750
or is it like involved in everything?

393
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,291
Is involved

394
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:44,291
in each thing, in an ontological relationship with each thing,

395
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,833
wayúu rituals

396
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,958
many of them have to do

397
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,958
with rituals of passage, of girls, from girls to women.

398
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,625
Others are rituals of sprinkling, impregnation

399
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,250
of fishing nets.

400
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,291
Others have to do with human contamination.

401
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,833
that must be decontaminated,

402
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,583
like a murderer, for example, or who has touched

403
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:09,125
the bones of humans in a burial,

404
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,416
then you can't eat with your hands for a few hours,

405
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,666
can not sleep,

406
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,666
He cannot do jobs that require effort.

407
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,333
There are many Wayúu protection rituals

408
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:22,708
that have to do with danger, warning signs,

409
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:26,000
signs of risk or that there may be a war

410
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
or simply the warning of a dream.

411
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,125
These rituals are very familiar among the Wayuú

412
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:35,208
and they have relative discretion.

413
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:38,416
Great, great.

414
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,041
One more question

415
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:54,083
If you had a message for everyone, what would it be?

416
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:58,541
Wow, I think that

417
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,458
There has to be a very big dialogue

418
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:04,458
in humanity between peoples and

419
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:06,916
human societies.

420
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:10,791
I believe that far from seeing many indigenous peoples

421
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:14,333
as societies

422
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:17,583
that are behind,

423
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,625
you must think about how sophisticated and

424
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,625
complex thinking of ontology,

425
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:25,500
from their way of understanding the person,

426
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,500
the notion of person and the relationship with time as well.

427
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:32,125
I believe that there is always a dialogue between ontologies

428
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,875
It will be very beneficial for this country.
