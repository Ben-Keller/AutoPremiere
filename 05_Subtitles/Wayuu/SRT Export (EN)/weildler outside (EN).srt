1
00:01:20:08 --> 00:01:24:01
Well, I have been asking you a lot about the Wayúu people,

2
00:01:24:01 --> 00:01:27:09
but you personally

3
00:01:28:03 --> 00:01:30:16
in what ways do you interact

4
00:01:30:16 --> 00:01:35:19
with nature, that is, with humans

5
00:01:35:19 --> 00:01:40:08
or is there a river or a tree down there that you connect with?

6
00:01:41:17 --> 00:01:44:22
Well this city is called “Río de la Hacha” (Ax River)

7
00:01:45:14 --> 00:01:49:02
and this is the river, in wayuunaiki it is said suchi'i,

8
00:01:49:18 --> 00:01:52:18
It is the most important river in La Guajira,

9
00:01:53:12 --> 00:01:56:12
perhaps the only one in the Wayúu territory,

10
00:01:57:01 --> 00:02:00:14
which has many streams that dry up in summer,

11
00:02:01:00 --> 00:02:04:00
but this is the most important river of the Wayuú.

12
00:02:04:10 --> 00:02:07:05
and Ríohacha for the Wayúu is called Suchima,

13
00:02:07:05 --> 00:02:10:09
This is a serpent river, a path river.

14
00:02:10:22 --> 00:02:13:14
It is linked to the stories of the Wayuú

15
00:02:13:14 --> 00:02:16:14
and on the way to the interior of the continent.

16
00:02:16:21 --> 00:02:19:13
It has the story of a snake

17
00:02:19:13 --> 00:02:23:08
that marks its course in each rainy season.

18
00:02:23:09 --> 00:02:26:09
That snake is called jerakanauwa

19
00:02:26:12 --> 00:02:31:03
and many Wayúu settlements are along this river.

20
00:02:31:13 --> 00:02:36:16
From the middle course of Distracción in the south of La Güajira

21
00:02:37:05 --> 00:02:40:12
to the mouth here in Riohacha, where it forms

22
00:02:40:12 --> 00:02:44:04
a Delta with the sea and where there is a lot of bird life

23
00:02:44:18 --> 00:02:49:04
pelicans, cormorants and formerly alligators.

24
00:02:49:12 --> 00:02:53:05
And it is a river of many tales for the Wayuú.

25
00:02:53:18 --> 00:02:56:18
Also, a kind of living being

26
00:02:56:22 --> 00:03:01:02
that generates a way of life, the way of life of the river

27
00:03:01:17 --> 00:03:04:02
and that has a forest that gives fruits

28
00:03:04:02 --> 00:03:05:14
and that also gives food,

29
00:03:06:16 --> 00:03:09:08
fish and other types of food.

30
00:03:09:08 --> 00:03:09:18
Therefore,

31
00:03:09:18 --> 00:03:12:18
this river is key in giving its name to this city

32
00:03:12:22 --> 00:03:14:03
which is Riohacha.

33
00:03:14:03 --> 00:03:15:21
It has been its story

34
00:03:15:21 --> 00:03:19:15
over time and this river originates in the Sierra Nevada,

35
00:03:19:15 --> 00:03:20:04
where there are

36
00:03:20:04 --> 00:03:23:23
the Kogis indigenous people and the Wiwas other indigenous peoples,

37
00:03:24:09 --> 00:03:27:09
who also have many stories about the river.

38
00:03:27:17 --> 00:03:30:16
So, in some way these rivers are a path and are memory,

39
00:03:30:19 --> 00:03:33:19
memory of all the people who live along it.

40
00:03:35:22 --> 00:03:38:12
Shocking and the river too

41
00:03:38:12 --> 00:03:41:12
is used as a mode of transportation, I guess.

42
00:03:41:18 --> 00:03:44:18
Well, he is navigable only in the lower part,

43
00:03:44:21 --> 00:03:47:21
only in this lower area, but

44
00:03:48:05 --> 00:03:51:09
Only canoes were used to get from one shore to the other.

45
00:03:51:21 --> 00:03:55:13
In Wayúu Riohacha is called suchimalü, suchima

46
00:03:56:08 --> 00:03:59:11
which was like a river that goes into the earth.

47
00:04:01:15 --> 00:04:02:04
That's good.

48
00:04:25:21 --> 00:04:28:21
And then, talking about this river

49
00:04:28:23 --> 00:04:32:09
and the stories he has as a being

50
00:04:32:11 --> 00:04:35:15
Living , can you tell me a little more about that?

51
00:04:36:02 --> 00:04:38:17
What is the river like?

52
00:04:38:17 --> 00:04:40:19
in relation to the people there,

53
00:04:40:19 --> 00:04:42:04
of the Wayuú?

54
00:04:42:04 --> 00:04:45:14
The river generates games, games for children,

55
00:04:46:06 --> 00:04:49:04
the Alligator game.

56
00:04:49:04 --> 00:04:50:20
There is a game called Trapiche, which

57
00:04:50:20 --> 00:04:54:00
It's like spinning around a river tree,

58
00:04:54:12 --> 00:04:57:11
water games in which they

59
00:04:58:11 --> 00:05:01:11
they raise the water with their foot, among the children

60
00:05:01:13 --> 00:05:03:12
They have a game called sombreros (hats),

61
00:05:03:12 --> 00:05:06:03
which is like touching and hiding in the water.

62
00:05:06:03 --> 00:05:07:19
They have many games

63
00:05:07:19 --> 00:05:10:06
and they are spaces where shaman women

64
00:05:10:06 --> 00:05:13:09
collect plants for healing,

65
00:05:14:03 --> 00:05:16:21
where women go to wash clothes from the river,

66
00:05:16:21 --> 00:05:19:21
where young Wayuú couples fall in love,

67
00:05:19:23 --> 00:05:22:01
also on the river bank.

68
00:05:22:01 --> 00:05:25:01
Generates a catch at certain times of the year

69
00:05:25:07 --> 00:05:29:13
and generates a great relationship with the river's own forest.

70
00:05:30:19 --> 00:05:32:04
He changes,

71
00:05:32:04 --> 00:05:35:04
from stones and almost transparent up there,

72
00:05:35:12 --> 00:05:39:01
until it gradually descends to the Caribbean.

73
00:05:39:15 --> 00:05:42:15
It is about 250 kilometers long,

74
00:05:43:12 --> 00:05:45:08
but it is a river that gives meaning

75
00:05:45:08 --> 00:05:48:23
to the territory in La Guajira, orders the territory.

76
00:05:48:23 --> 00:05:50:13
That is why it is so important.

77
00:05:50:13 --> 00:05:52:23
And when it reaches Riohacha it forms a delta,

78
00:05:52:23 --> 00:05:56:02
This is one of the arms, but there are three more

79
00:05:56:07 --> 00:05:59:12
in that direction, where there is a lot of life.

80
00:05:59:12 --> 00:06:01:19
crabs, oysters,

81
00:06:01:19 --> 00:06:04:19
there were alligators before and anyway,

82
00:06:05:07 --> 00:06:08:00
structures the territory.

83
00:06:08:00 --> 00:06:08:19
Very important

84
00:06:08:19 --> 00:06:12:01
then for entertainment, for experience.

85
00:06:12:13 --> 00:06:15:10
for humans and…
Of course

86
00:06:15:10 --> 00:06:19:11
And the road, he was called a river road because following

87
00:06:19:11 --> 00:06:22:11
the course of it, you reach the throat

88
00:06:22:11 --> 00:06:23:15
between the Sierra Nevada

89
00:06:23:15 --> 00:06:25:03
and the Serranía del Perijá,

90
00:06:25:03 --> 00:06:27:11
as inside what is now Colombia.

91
00:06:27:11 --> 00:06:30:13
This is the way, follow the river.

92
00:06:31:15 --> 00:06:32:19
Union.

93
00:06:32:19 --> 00:06:35:19
And you as a child,

94
00:06:37:15 --> 00:06:39:00
did you grow up here in Riohacha?

95
00:06:39:00 --> 00:06:42:10
Yes, between Riohacha and Carrizal is my original land,

96
00:06:43:07 --> 00:06:44:09
but I studied here

97
00:06:44:09 --> 00:06:46:12
and therefore the river was very important.

98
00:06:46:12 --> 00:06:49:19
I saw the last alligator in the river killed when I

99
00:06:49:19 --> 00:06:53:08
I was like, seven years old, everyone ran away.

100
00:06:53:08 --> 00:06:56:18
And here, in this place, here where we are, 20 meters away,

101
00:06:57:04 --> 00:06:59:08
They hung that alligator.

They hung it?

102
00:06:59:08 --> 00:07:04:03
Yes, that's how they showed it, it had a salmon-colored stomach.

103
00:07:04:13 --> 00:07:07:20
and it was big, perhaps it was the last alligator that was in the river.

104
00:07:08:06 --> 00:07:10:03
Why did they kill him?

105
00:07:10:03 --> 00:07:13:03
We don't know, because it's full of alligators.

106
00:07:14:01 --> 00:07:15:23
And do you remember the last alligator?

107
00:07:15:23 --> 00:07:17:05
The very last.

108
00:07:17:05 --> 00:07:19:05
Wow, that’s a story!

109
00:07:19:05 --> 00:07:21:16
Yeah

110
00:07:41:00 --> 00:07:42:10
and the river

111
00:07:42:10 --> 00:07:45:19
as a living being, how does he express himself?

112
00:07:46:03 --> 00:07:47:22
On the riverbed,

113
00:07:49:04 --> 00:07:51:05
in every rainy season

114
00:07:51:05 --> 00:07:53:17
he can change his path,

115
00:07:53:17 --> 00:07:56:07
but at the same time he has a hierarchy.

116
00:07:56:07 --> 00:07:59:04
There are the small streams that feed it,

117
00:07:59:04 --> 00:08:01:22
the streams are

118
00:08:01:22 --> 00:08:05:17
They are like other arms of the river and the river has a bottom

119
00:08:06:08 --> 00:08:09:05
and the Wayúu know and organize it by bottoms,

120
00:08:09:05 --> 00:08:10:13
where the bottom is sand,

121
00:08:10:13 --> 00:08:12:07
where the bottom is stone,

122
00:08:12:07 --> 00:08:15:00
where the bottom is tree roots, where

123
00:08:15:00 --> 00:08:18:00
The bottom is ravines and where the bottom is mud.

124
00:08:18:07 --> 00:08:21:07
This is how the Wayúu categorize the course of the river,

125
00:08:21:07 --> 00:08:24:07
because of the type of bottom it has below,

126
00:08:24:14 --> 00:08:27:04
if it is sand, mud, stone, root.

127
00:08:27:04 --> 00:08:28:22
And does it have different characteristics?

128
00:08:28:22 --> 00:08:31:13
Different in each place.

129
00:08:31:13 --> 00:08:34:07
And does it also have any kind of souls, like you’re saying,

130
00:08:34:07 --> 00:08:35:08
at different times?

131
00:08:35:08 --> 00:08:40:21
Yes, many myths talk about him, they talk about snakes

132
00:08:41:16 --> 00:08:44:17
that follow him, of a bull that lives within him.

133
00:08:45:08 --> 00:08:48:15
They call that snake doroy in some places, in others

134
00:08:48:15 --> 00:08:51:02
they call him jerakanawa,

135
00:08:51:02 --> 00:08:54:19
and the songs and stories are given across the river.

136
00:08:55:07 --> 00:08:56:02
many songs,

137
00:08:56:02 --> 00:08:57:17
many stories that have to do

138
00:08:57:17 --> 00:08:59:05
with the river as a space.

139
00:09:00:19 --> 00:09:02:18
And that tells me a little about

140
00:09:02:18 --> 00:09:07:11
What is the significance of music and dance among the Wayuú?

141
00:09:08:07 --> 00:09:11:09
Music is something that was given to us.

142
00:09:11:19 --> 00:09:15:03
Music is something that more than a human invention,

143
00:09:15:03 --> 00:09:18:03
It is a legacy of non-humans.

144
00:09:18:12 --> 00:09:22:14
From the turtle, then the drum, the curlew played it.

145
00:09:23:02 --> 00:09:27:08
The trees that were musicians give us flutes,

146
00:09:27:17 --> 00:09:29:13
the wood from which they are built

147
00:09:29:13 --> 00:09:31:15
the musical instruments.

148
00:09:31:15 --> 00:09:33:19
Music

149
00:09:33:19 --> 00:09:35:19
occurs in sociability,

150
00:09:35:19 --> 00:09:40:01
When dancing, dances, but it can also be given for grazing.

151
00:09:40:15 --> 00:09:43:14
The drum speaks to the Wayúu, it lifts their spirits

152
00:09:43:14 --> 00:09:46:01
and they listen to it for a horse race,

153
00:09:46:01 --> 00:09:49:01
mark the cattle, for a party,

154
00:09:49:01 --> 00:09:52:01
for a dance for a girl's release from confinement.

155
00:09:52:14 --> 00:09:55:18
There are many forms of the drum, but the drum speaks

156
00:09:56:10 --> 00:09:58:22
and every drum performer

157
00:09:58:22 --> 00:10:02:07
has a characteristic sound that makes it identifiable

158
00:10:02:07 --> 00:10:04:07
differently from others.

159
00:10:04:07 --> 00:10:07:01
It serves to make a woman fall in love,

160
00:10:07:01 --> 00:10:09:22
the drum, which was previously the turtle

161
00:10:09:22 --> 00:10:12:22
terrestrial, was the first executor of that.

162
00:10:13:09 --> 00:10:16:09
The birds left us rhetoric

163
00:10:16:12 --> 00:10:18:22
and harmony in speech,

164
00:10:18:22 --> 00:10:21:03
that sounds like music too,

165
00:10:21:03 --> 00:10:22:20
That is the legacy of birds.

166
00:10:22:20 --> 00:10:26:11
The palabreros are descendants of birds, the good ones

167
00:10:26:11 --> 00:10:29:13
palavers because persuasive speech

168
00:10:29:23 --> 00:10:33:08
It must be a seductive song to change behavior

169
00:10:33:08 --> 00:10:34:20
of human beings,

170
00:10:34:20 --> 00:10:36:03
that's the role.

171
00:10:36:03 --> 00:10:39:03
So, music and words are very linked,

172
00:10:39:05 --> 00:10:41:15
but there is also harvest festival music,

173
00:10:41:15 --> 00:10:42:19
games,

174
00:10:42:19 --> 00:10:44:10
like the kaulayawa,

175
00:10:44:10 --> 00:10:47:10
which are dances and harvest games,

176
00:10:48:06 --> 00:10:53:05
so the Sawawa, the Maashi, the Uotoroyoi.

177
00:10:53:05 --> 00:10:56:05
the Taliraai which is a vocal bow,

178
00:10:56:18 --> 00:11:01:22
the Kasha or drum, the maraca that the Wayúu woman plays,

179
00:11:01:22 --> 00:11:04:22
the shaman, allows her to ascend

180
00:11:05:04 --> 00:11:06:22
towards the spirits

181
00:11:06:22 --> 00:11:09:16
where they are located and find the assistance.

182
00:11:09:16 --> 00:11:12:16
Then the music helps the shaman to heal and raise

183
00:11:12:23 --> 00:11:15:16
to seek auxiliary spirits for connection.

184
00:11:17:16 --> 00:11:18:00
That's it

185
00:11:18:00 --> 00:11:21:02
a very important role.
Definitely.

186
00:11:21:07 --> 00:11:25:07
And something we haven't talked about yet is dance.

187
00:11:25:20 --> 00:11:28:09
and dancing, what does it have to do with it?

188
00:11:28:09 --> 00:11:31:06
dancing with the Wayúu people?

189
00:11:31:06 --> 00:11:33:14
The Wayúu have

190
00:11:33:14 --> 00:11:36:16
at least two dances that are very important.

191
00:11:36:23 --> 00:11:39:17
The Kaa'ulayawaa that is on the verge of extinction,

192
00:11:39:17 --> 00:11:43:10
that lasted days and days during the youth’s harvests,

193
00:11:43:19 --> 00:11:46:17
which is more numerous and has games.

194
00:11:46:17 --> 00:11:49:19
And the Yonna, is a ritual dance that is played

195
00:11:49:19 --> 00:11:52:19
with the drum when a dream occurs,

196
00:11:52:22 --> 00:11:56:02
Or to celebrate the end of confinement for a girl

197
00:11:56:02 --> 00:11:59:15
who is already a woman, with a prescription from a female shaman or

198
00:11:59:15 --> 00:12:04:11
a shaman man. It is a ritual dance that mimes

199
00:12:05:01 --> 00:12:07:11
of insects,

200
00:12:07:11 --> 00:12:10:11
a mimesis of birds, for example,

201
00:12:10:20 --> 00:12:13:20
and that the Wayúu man and women

202
00:12:13:21 --> 00:12:15:16
perform during festive times.

203
00:12:16:21 --> 00:12:19:14
Her name is Yonna.

204
00:12:19:14 --> 00:12:22:01
Is that what we saw on Friday?

205
00:12:22:01 --> 00:12:24:18
On Friday they saw more of a Kaa'ulayawaa.

206
00:12:32:12 --> 00:12:37:07
I like how you started talking about the river.

207
00:12:37:07 --> 00:12:40:07
But I had also asked you about how

208
00:12:40:17 --> 00:12:41:21
maybe it's the river.

209
00:12:41:21 --> 00:12:45:21
Is there a non-human person that you have

210
00:12:45:21 --> 00:12:49:19
a strong connection with, or a place?

211
00:12:50:05 --> 00:12:53:05
A place, yes.

212
00:12:53:12 --> 00:12:56:12
There is a place called Pajara Turtles

213
00:12:57:04 --> 00:12:59:15
in Carrizal,

214
00:12:59:15 --> 00:13:03:01
where in the desert there are some rocks.

215
00:13:03:13 --> 00:13:05:15
Those rocks were the cattle,

216
00:13:05:15 --> 00:13:07:09
They are turtles that came out of the sea

217
00:13:07:09 --> 00:13:09:18
and they became cattle.

218
00:13:09:18 --> 00:13:12:03
The Wayuú took cattle from the sea.

219
00:13:12:03 --> 00:13:14:21
They were turtles that transformed into cows,

220
00:13:14:21 --> 00:13:17:11
certain fish in goats and sheep,

221
00:13:17:11 --> 00:13:19:02
and that is why the Wayúu have cattle.

222
00:13:19:02 --> 00:13:21:17
The origin of cattle for the Wayúu is there.

223
00:13:22:18 --> 00:13:23:21
One day

224
00:13:23:21 --> 00:13:26:21
that the Wayúu took over the cattle,

225
00:13:26:22 --> 00:13:29:22
some turtles did not make it to the Sea

226
00:13:30:09 --> 00:13:33:01
and the sun rose and turned them into rocks.

227
00:13:33:01 --> 00:13:34:06
and in the distance

228
00:13:34:06 --> 00:13:37:06
It looks like cattle trying to return to the sea,

229
00:13:37:07 --> 00:13:38:05
it's a mirage

230
00:13:38:05 --> 00:13:41:12
In the desert, it looks like water and the rocks look like cattle.

231
00:13:41:23 --> 00:13:44:16
That place is called the Pajara turtles,

232
00:13:44:16 --> 00:13:47:11
but there are many other places, the Aalasü stone,

233
00:13:47:11 --> 00:13:48:12
where are the emblems

234
00:13:48:12 --> 00:13:52:01
of all the members of each clan in La Guajira,

235
00:13:52:16 --> 00:13:55:16
It is a key place in Wayúu mythology.

236
00:13:56:13 --> 00:13:59:07
This wososopu, there is Wolunka

237
00:13:59:07 --> 00:14:03:11
the chair where she sang, the woman with the vagina dentata.

238
00:14:04:00 --> 00:14:06:08
The Wayúu world is full of mythological places,

239
00:14:06:08 --> 00:14:09:10
all with a very strong and imposing presence that

240
00:14:09:10 --> 00:14:12:10
When you arrive you feel in a solemn place,

241
00:14:12:18 --> 00:14:15:18
in a place that condenses time and memory.

242
00:14:16:09 --> 00:14:17:19
Those are places

243
00:14:18:18 --> 00:14:19:08
who have a

244
00:14:19:08 --> 00:14:22:08
narrative structure and that tell us about the

245
00:14:22:10 --> 00:14:23:20
history.

246
00:14:23:20 --> 00:14:27:14
It always feels calm, this is so nice

247
00:14:27:14 --> 00:14:28:19
here

248
00:14:28:19 --> 00:14:30:00
the river.

249
00:14:31:00 --> 00:14:32:22
Sadly it’s a bit dirty

250
00:14:32:22 --> 00:14:35:15
it could be cleaner.

251
00:14:35:15 --> 00:14:38:15
Yes, to respect the river more,

252
00:14:39:03 --> 00:14:41:23
but the city is like that.

253
00:14:41:23 --> 00:14:44:13
How do you see that?

254
00:14:44:13 --> 00:14:48:02
That clash between modernity

255
00:14:48:07 --> 00:14:51:11
and the Wayúu people,

256
00:14:52:19 --> 00:14:55:01
That betrayal, how do you see it

257
00:14:55:01 --> 00:14:57:03
Interviewer] in the future? How are we doing?

258
00:14:57:03 --> 00:14:58:22
I think that the Wayúu have known

259
00:14:58:22 --> 00:15:02:08
respond to many changes since the 15th century,

260
00:15:02:20 --> 00:15:05:19
when they encountered Europeans.

261
00:15:05:23 --> 00:15:08:14
In the XVI, XVII,

262
00:15:08:14 --> 00:15:11:06
They acquired the cattle, the firearms,

263
00:15:11:06 --> 00:15:13:07
The horse,

264
00:15:13:07 --> 00:15:15:23
came into conflictive or harmonious contact,

265
00:15:15:23 --> 00:15:18:22
sometimes with Europeans, with Africans,

266
00:15:18:23 --> 00:15:21:13
and they have given an answer over time

267
00:15:21:13 --> 00:15:22:06
to survive.

268
00:15:23:08 --> 00:15:25:00
Every era,

269
00:15:25:00 --> 00:15:28:00
Every century, every decade, brings challenges to the Wayuú.

270
00:15:28:16 --> 00:15:31:13
Now they have others that are typical of this era.

271
00:15:31:13 --> 00:15:34:02
So far they have been able to respond to that,

272
00:15:34:02 --> 00:15:38:01
sometimes paying a very high cost in human lives,

273
00:15:38:11 --> 00:15:41:02
in poverty, in loss of autonomy.

274
00:15:41:02 --> 00:15:44:11
I trust that the Wayúu will remain over time.

275
00:15:45:02 --> 00:15:47:11
There is a more complex universe

276
00:15:47:11 --> 00:15:50:10
than that of their elders.

277
00:16:09:03 --> 00:16:12:02
Yes, well,

278
00:16:14:05 --> 00:16:15:12
tell me again.

279
00:16:15:12 --> 00:16:18:12
What river is this?

280
00:16:18:12 --> 00:16:21:09
Ranchería River.This river is called Ranchería River,

281
00:16:21:09 --> 00:16:24:09
It is the most important river in La Güajira.

282
00:16:25:13 --> 00:16:26:05
and that's why

283
00:16:26:05 --> 00:16:29:02
is it called Riohacha?

284
00:16:29:02 --> 00:16:32:11
Yes, Riohacha is due to this river.

285
00:16:33:02 --> 00:16:33:10
Ok.

286
00:16:35:04 --> 00:16:35:10
Well,

287
00:16:35:10 --> 00:16:38:10
Can you tell me a little about,

288
00:16:39:01 --> 00:16:43:04
an intimate relationship of

289
00:16:43:16 --> 00:16:49:00
yours with that place or with that river or the sea or the wind

290
00:16:49:00 --> 00:16:51:07
here?
Yeah.

291
00:16:51:07 --> 00:16:53:05
Well, our childhood passed here.

292
00:16:53:05 --> 00:16:54:13
There in

293
00:16:54:13 --> 00:16:57:13
That’s the school and the river and the sea,

294
00:16:58:18 --> 00:17:00:23
that at that time when I was a child,

295
00:17:00:23 --> 00:17:03:12
There only was had indigenous canoes.

296
00:17:03:12 --> 00:17:05:22
It's what you saw from the windows

297
00:17:05:22 --> 00:17:08:16
wayúu fishermen crossing the sea

298
00:17:08:16 --> 00:17:11:06
with small engines, engines

299
00:17:11:06 --> 00:17:14:06
very simple, very simple or sailing.

300
00:17:14:19 --> 00:17:15:05
And well,

301
00:17:15:05 --> 00:17:15:17
this river

302
00:17:15:17 --> 00:17:18:17
marks the life of the city just like the Caribbean.

303
00:17:20:03 --> 00:17:21:11
The sea is very important

304
00:17:21:11 --> 00:17:24:11
in the Wayúu world.

305
00:17:24:22 --> 00:17:27:22
Apalanchi means one who lives by the sea.

306
00:17:28:13 --> 00:17:32:18
But Apalaanchi that is also used,

307
00:17:32:18 --> 00:17:36:08
It means the one who has his heart turned towards the sea,

308
00:17:36:21 --> 00:17:39:21
like the Wayúu fishermen, whose world

309
00:17:39:21 --> 00:17:42:20
is the sea and whose territory is the sea

310
00:17:43:02 --> 00:17:46:21
and its relationship is with marine beings, turtles, groupers,

311
00:17:47:18 --> 00:17:50:18
sharks, barracudas,

312
00:17:51:08 --> 00:17:54:17
clams, oysters, shrimp.

313
00:17:55:08 --> 00:17:57:10
All that series of beings,

314
00:17:57:10 --> 00:18:01:03
each of whom have a different personality.

315
00:18:02:08 --> 00:18:03:03
When the Wayuú

316
00:18:03:03 --> 00:18:07:06
Find fish cardumen that are marching,

317
00:18:08:04 --> 00:18:10:23
The Wayuú call it veloriantes (mourners),

318
00:18:10:23 --> 00:18:13:23
because they march together,

319
00:18:13:23 --> 00:18:16:23
Just as the human wayúu go to funerals

320
00:18:17:00 --> 00:18:20:04
In multitude, they too march across the sea,

321
00:18:20:04 --> 00:18:22:01
in that multitude as well.

322
00:18:22:01 --> 00:18:25:01
And there are fixed fish that have houses,

323
00:18:25:16 --> 00:18:26:11
Fish such as the

324
00:18:26:11 --> 00:18:27:21
grouper who live in

325
00:18:27:21 --> 00:18:30:21
reefs, near corals, in stony areas

326
00:18:31:13 --> 00:18:36:06
and there are other fish that are walkers that do not have houses,

327
00:18:36:06 --> 00:18:39:20
They are wanderers of the sea. One of those fish is the shark

328
00:18:40:11 --> 00:18:42:00
that wanders through the sea.

329
00:18:42:00 --> 00:18:45:18
But others, like horse mackerel, also roam the sea.

330
00:18:46:09 --> 00:18:49:19
There are others like locusts, like certain

331
00:18:49:19 --> 00:18:53:03
scorpion fish that live in areas

332
00:18:53:14 --> 00:18:56:14
fixed, which are called beings with a house in the sea,

333
00:18:56:20 --> 00:18:58:14
that they have a place to live.

334
00:18:58:14 --> 00:19:00:09
That is.

335
00:19:00:09 --> 00:19:03:02
Everything has a similar name.

336
00:19:03:02 --> 00:19:06:11
They are metaphors, a social metaphor.

337
00:19:06:22 --> 00:19:09:09
That's right, that's right. And

338
00:19:10:12 --> 00:19:11:20
is there something between the water

339
00:19:11:20 --> 00:19:15:08
fresh and salt water?
The estuary.

340
00:19:15:15 --> 00:19:17:05
The estuary that takes place

341
00:19:17:05 --> 00:19:20:23
in a river mouth, in the estuary, in the Ranchería delta,

342
00:19:21:11 --> 00:19:23:12
where there’s fresh water and salty water,

343
00:19:23:12 --> 00:19:27:03
there are coastal lagoons and there are a series of beings.

344
00:19:28:08 --> 00:19:31:02
They find shrimp in those lagoons,

345
00:19:31:02 --> 00:19:32:22
certain fish like the lebranche,

346
00:19:32:22 --> 00:19:36:13
The Liza, which are costume fish and the Wayúu know it

347
00:19:36:13 --> 00:19:39:13
and they collect it and have lived for centuries

348
00:19:40:02 --> 00:19:42:23
Out of those resources, of their knowledge of the periods

349
00:19:42:23 --> 00:19:46:10
in which they arise, in which they are abundant and so

350
00:19:47:05 --> 00:19:47:20
They’re part of

351
00:19:47:20 --> 00:19:50:20
their economic calendar, of their social life.

352
00:19:51:15 --> 00:19:55:01
And this wind is so strong, right?

353
00:19:55:01 --> 00:19:58:00
This wind is northeast.

354
00:19:58:07 --> 00:19:59:17
this wind

355
00:19:59:17 --> 00:20:04:00
He is a loving father who softens the temperature of the water.

356
00:20:04:00 --> 00:20:06:01
It's called Jepírachi,

357
00:20:06:01 --> 00:20:06:18
It's a wind

358
00:20:06:18 --> 00:20:10:04
northeast trade and always comes in that direction.

359
00:20:10:04 --> 00:20:13:04
It is the predominant wind of the Wayuú

360
00:20:13:09 --> 00:20:14:01
and it is a wind

361
00:20:14:01 --> 00:20:17:00
which has a different character from other winds.

362
00:20:17:03 --> 00:20:19:03
The Wayuú distinguish the wind from the north,

363
00:20:20:03 --> 00:20:22:01
to this northeast wind,

364
00:20:22:01 --> 00:20:23:12
to a false wind

365
00:20:23:12 --> 00:20:25:03
what passes for this wind

366
00:20:25:03 --> 00:20:27:02
to deceive the fishermen.

367
00:20:27:02 --> 00:20:31:10
Jo'utai a wind that comes from the east and brings hunger,

368
00:20:31:10 --> 00:20:35:05
Drought, is an evil wind. Aruleeshi is another wind,

369
00:20:35:19 --> 00:20:39:02
There is the road’s wind from and there are other winds.

370
00:20:39:02 --> 00:20:40:15
Every wind has a character,

371
00:20:40:15 --> 00:20:43:23
a temperament and a relationship with the Wayuú, and the winds

372
00:20:43:23 --> 00:20:47:01
They have antagonisms between them, they can fight,

373
00:20:47:14 --> 00:20:49:19
They can have friendly relations,

374
00:20:49:19 --> 00:20:52:06
They are people who have paths

375
00:20:52:06 --> 00:20:54:19
and that's what companies don't understand.

376
00:20:54:19 --> 00:20:57:19
Like, what is the path of the winds

377
00:20:57:20 --> 00:21:00:10
and what is the character of the winds.

378
00:21:00:10 --> 00:21:03:10
And here you can see the wind, the character,

379
00:21:03:21 --> 00:21:06:21
you can see how he is talking.

380
00:21:07:12 --> 00:21:09:05
Yes, Yes. Well,

381
00:21:09:05 --> 00:21:12:22
Father of the Wayúu fishermen, the father is this wind.

382
00:21:13:02 --> 00:21:14:05
Jepirachi, the father.

383
00:21:15:15 --> 00:21:18:10
And is there anything else you would like to share?

384
00:21:18:10 --> 00:21:20:10
Well, no. It was that.

385
00:21:20:10 --> 00:21:20:22
I think that

386
00:21:20:22 --> 00:21:23:22
what we have talked about about the sea, the wind, the river.

387
00:21:24:11 --> 00:21:26:10
Great.

388
00:21:26:10 --> 00:21:28:16
Well.

389
00:21:28:16 --> 00:21:30:05
One more thing.

390
00:21:30:05 --> 00:21:31:20
Of all those relationships,

391
00:21:31:20 --> 00:21:34:20
Is there some spirituality too, with

392
00:21:35:05 --> 00:21:38:11
or is it like involved in everything?

393
00:21:39:04 --> 00:21:40:00
Is involved

394
00:21:40:00 --> 00:21:43:00
in each thing, in an ontological relationship with each thing,

395
00:21:44:00 --> 00:21:46:13
wayúu rituals

396
00:21:46:13 --> 00:21:48:16
many of them have to do

397
00:21:48:16 --> 00:21:51:16
with rituals of passage, of girls, from girls to women.

398
00:21:52:02 --> 00:21:55:08
Others are rituals of sprinkling, impregnation

399
00:21:55:15 --> 00:21:56:23
of fishing nets.

400
00:21:56:23 --> 00:22:00:00
Others have to do with human contamination.

401
00:22:00:00 --> 00:22:01:13
that must be decontaminated,

402
00:22:01:13 --> 00:22:04:07
like a murderer, for example, or who has touched

403
00:22:04:07 --> 00:22:07:20
the bones of humans in a burial,

404
00:22:08:10 --> 00:22:11:03
then you can't eat with your hands for a few hours,

405
00:22:11:03 --> 00:22:12:08
can not sleep,

406
00:22:12:08 --> 00:22:15:08
He cannot do jobs that require effort.

407
00:22:15:23 --> 00:22:18:00
There are many Wayúu protection rituals

408
00:22:18:00 --> 00:22:21:09
that have to do with danger, warning signs,

409
00:22:21:20 --> 00:22:24:16
signs of risk or that there may be a war

410
00:22:24:16 --> 00:22:27:16
or simply the warning of a dream.

411
00:22:28:00 --> 00:22:29:19
These rituals are very familiar among the Wayuú

412
00:22:30:21 --> 00:22:33:21
and they have relative discretion.

413
00:22:34:02 --> 00:22:37:02
Great, great.

414
00:23:46:16 --> 00:23:48:15
One more question

415
00:23:48:15 --> 00:23:52:16
If you had a message for everyone, what would it be?

416
00:23:54:03 --> 00:23:57:03
Wow, I think that

417
00:23:58:05 --> 00:24:00:01
There has to be a very big dialogue

418
00:24:00:01 --> 00:24:03:01
in humanity between peoples and

419
00:24:03:12 --> 00:24:05:12
human societies.

420
00:24:05:12 --> 00:24:09:09
I believe that far from seeing many indigenous peoples

421
00:24:09:22 --> 00:24:12:22
as societies

422
00:24:13:04 --> 00:24:16:04
that are behind,

423
00:24:16:15 --> 00:24:18:04
you must think about how sophisticated and

424
00:24:18:04 --> 00:24:21:04
complex thinking of ontology,

425
00:24:21:12 --> 00:24:24:01
from their way of understanding the person,

426
00:24:24:01 --> 00:24:27:01
the notion of person and the relationship with time as well.

427
00:24:27:17 --> 00:24:30:16
I believe that there is always a dialogue between ontologies

428
00:24:30:20 --> 00:24:33:10
It will be very beneficial for this country.
