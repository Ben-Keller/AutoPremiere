1
00:01 --> 00:08
Well Neko, you are entering the Macuira mountain range.
These are land of the Arpushana (family lineage)

2
00:10 --> 00:14
The story of Wolunka, happened in the land of the Arpushana.

3
00:16 --> 00:20
Here is the stone where Wolunka was that
Day, as I told you.

4
00:24 --> 00:30
TRUE. In fact, in our culture it is necessary
let us know these stories

5
00:31 --> 00:36
So that we continue to value these wonders that we have now

6
00:37 --> 00:43
Since this is what our ancestors have left
and our grandparents

7
00:44 --> 00:48
That's why I'm here in your territory Magalys.

8
00:49 --> 00:55
See I come from the west and now I'm here
in the north. Yeah.

9
00:56 --> 00:58
Where the Wayuu people originated.

10
01:00 --> 01:08
I am glad to know the place where Wolunka was.
We can talk a little more about that.

11
01:09 --> 01:11
I am going to tell you then the story of Wolunka.

12
01:14 --> 01:15
This here

13
01:16 --> 01:21
It is the stone of Wolunka, where he used to sit

14
01:22 --> 01:25
Wolunka was a very beautiful woman

15
01:26 --> 01:29
Who used to sit there while taking a bath in the afternoons

16
01:31 --> 01:35
And back then there were also two brothers

17
01:37 --> 01:39
They were twins as they call it now.

18
01:41 --> 01:44
But when they saw her bathe in the afternoons

19
01:45 --> 01:51
they were scared and did not want to bathe near her
because of the teeth they saw in her vagina.

20
01:52 --> 01:57
And they said "what could we do" because we won't have
descendants for her.

21
01:59 --> 02:04
Since the men were afraid of him and of course,
she did have teeth in her vagina

22
02:05 --> 02:09
None of the men wanted to get close to him for fear of
his teeth

23
02:11 --> 02:12
One day.

24
02:13 --> 02:16
Before, I clarified that Wolunka was Juya's daughter.

25
02:38 --> 02:42
So, one day they sat down to think about what they should do.

26
02:43 --> 02:47
Since they were worried about not leaving descendants, but with
Wolunka like that, you couldn't

27
02:48 --> 02:51
Said the twin brothers

28
02:53 --> 02:55
As they talked.

29
03:04 --> 03:10
They decided then that they should knock out his teeth,
those of the vagina

30
03:11 --> 03:14
And they went looking for the arrow

31
03:16 --> 03:20
It was from up there where they shot the arrow
while bathing

32
03:22 --> 03:26
In fact, there you can see his footprints when he
they shot the arrow

33
03:28 --> 03:32
Too bad we can't go up there

34
03:33 --> 03:36
Because there you can see the footprints of his Kou'su (shoes)

35
03:37 --> 03:43
The arrow that was thrown at him was right in his intimate part

36
03:44 --> 03:50
Which caused a great bleeding that
came to the lake

37
03:51 --> 03:53
Making the water red.

38
03:55 --> 04:02
Wolunka, for his part, left bleeding
and tormented by pain

39
04:04 --> 04:07
He went to his father Juya (rain)

40
04:08 --> 04:19
I told him what they did to him

41
04:11 --> 04:16
Then Juya got angry and went in search of the brothers

42
04:20 --> 04:26
But they fled immediately, they had
hidden in a cave

43
04:28 --> 04:33
They hid from Father Juya because they knew
that he would be angry

44
04:34 --> 04:35
by Wolunka

45
04:37 --> 04:41
While they hid in the cave they were looking for them

46
04:45 --> 04:50
Juya divided the stones in two from the rage he had

47
04:52 --> 04:53
They called at

48
04:55 --> 04:56
Birds

49
04:58 --> 05:03
So that they pecked at the cave where they were

50
05:05 --> 05:10
That explains why some birds have

51
05:14 --> 05:19
It has a short beak, an example of which is

52
05:21 --> 05:25
The bird Utta (bridged boob) Utta, yes Utta.

53
05:26 --> 05:27
He

54
05:28 --> 05:30
utta and the other

55
05:31 --> 05:32
That it's called

56
05:37 --> 05:41
This, the woodpecker too

57
05:44 --> 05:50
From there, they chose utta, fuel that won out of all

58
05:51 --> 05:56
To stipulate the matrilineal lineage, by which
we are organized now. Yeah.

59
05:57 --> 06:00
Because it was not only for the woman but for everyone

60
06:01 --> 06:04
So yeah, it was utta that won

61
06:05 --> 06:06
he organized everything

62
06:07 --> 06:10
And of course I win out of all the birds

63
06:11 --> 06:16
I give the name to each one, he said this is Uriana,
This is Pausayu

64
06:18 --> 06:19
He was

65
06:20 --> 06:26
Who won. He was in charge of distributing the eirüku
(family lineages) according to the accounts of the elders

66
06:27 --> 06:34
That's why I remain engraved in the stone of destiny
as they say, there, at sword point

67
06:35 --> 06:36
Where now

68
06:38 --> 06:39
They all go

69
06:40 --> 06:43
And those who enter or the one who enters

70
06:45 --> 06:46
must pass

71
06:49 --> 06:51
Does the one who manages to pass the cave have a long life?

72
06:52 --> 06:54
Yes, live for many years

73
06:55 --> 06:58
Whoever gets stuck won't live many years

74
07:00 --> 07:02
This is the story of wolunka

75
07:03 --> 07:08
And after they knocked out his teeth
What happened to wolunka?

76
07:09 --> 07:11
We have our families, now

77
07:13 --> 07:15
we have our lineages

78
07:16 --> 07:23
She bled a lot right? Yeah. Well, that's where it comes from.
menstruation in women so that we can ovulate

79
07:24 --> 07:26
We already have children and we have multiplied on earth

80
07:28 --> 07:33
If she hadn't knocked out her teeth

81
07:35 --> 07:40
We did not have ancestors, we did not exist, we would not multiply on earth

82
07:41 --> 07:47
This is how our ancestors have told us about the
Wolunka's story

83
07:48 --> 07:55
That is, our origin as a people is from Wolunka,
yes it was thanks to her

84
07:57 --> 08:05
It is very important to talk about it since many are unaware
of this story, yes.

85
08:06 --> 08:12
It is not so common to talk about these stories, as
Wolunka's, yes.

86
08:14 --> 08:21
About the culture of us Wayuu. Even so, I know
Speak, the story is told

87
08:22 --> 08:26
They come to see it.
has your name

88
08:27 --> 08:30
The water was red, it turned red

89
08:31 --> 08:34
It was very reddish, where

90
08:36 --> 08:40
Blood was spilled, yes, where I spill blood,
because I bleed a lot

91
08:42 --> 08:49
This is the story of wolunka, so that we
we existed and multiplied on earth

92
08:51 --> 08:52
Juya's daughter (rain)

93
08:54 --> 08:55
the beautiful wolunka

94
08:56 --> 08:59
From which we originate, from which we exist, yes.

95
09:02 --> 09:04
What else do you want to know.

96
09:06 --> 09:09
It is very interesting to hear everything you have told me

97
09:10 --> 09:11
If I am correct

98
09:12 --> 09:14
Yes of course.
Now.

99
09:16 --> 09:19
I am here in the north zone, to know about Wolunka,

100
09:20 --> 09:21
To know

101
09:22 --> 09:23
yes, how interesting

102
09:24 --> 09:30
To know our origin. Yes, of us the Wayuu,
since ancient times.

103
09:33 --> 09:40
The thing related to wolunka, like that stone where he sat, right? If he sat there.

104
09:41 --> 09:45
Well, I used to see the images on sheets, too

105
09:47 --> 09:49
I also saw it on the phone until now

106
09:50 --> 09:59
I was like, I wish I could go there, but you're already here,
You already know it, you already saw it, we are already here and it is very good

107
10:00 --> 10:04
There's always water, that's good, it's always cold

108
10:06 --> 10:10
They say that when people get close

109
10:11 --> 10:12
It's like,

110
10:13 --> 10:15
They felt the spiritual atmosphere of the place,

111
10:16 --> 10:21
when someone arrives, a lot of spiritual energy is revived
in the place

112
10:22 --> 10:29
If the environment is heavy, even some people
her spirit appears

113
10:30 --> 10:38
You hear sounds of her washing, at night, if you pass
around here, you hear as if bathing or swimming

114
10:39 --> 10:41
She manifests herself like this, with whoever wants to listen to her

115
10:42 --> 10:44
Some like it and others don't.

116
10:46 --> 10:48
This place is sacred, right.

117
10:49 --> 10:50
They call it sacred

118
10:52 --> 10:53
Or sacred site

119
10:56 --> 10:58
Yes, and with this

120
11:00 --> 11:06
I say that I have learned, but just as I was there
many who still don't know

121
11:08 --> 11:12
And they need to know stories like this

122
11:13 --> 11:18
So that they recognize their value and importance within
of our culture

123
11:19 --> 11:26
So that they say and share what their lineage is,
how is represented

124
11:27 --> 11:29
Since we all have a lineage, yes.

125
11:30 --> 11:32
For example, this is the territory of the Arpushana

126
11:35 --> 11:42
Instead, my territory is there, now we are going there
in Alewalu, where my grandmother is from

127
11:43 --> 11:48
It still has mangoes, where my grandmother has mangoes.
I always went to look for mangoes

128
11:50 --> 11:52
And Kayushipuna is my father's territory

129
11:54 --> 11:55
AND

130
11:56 --> 12:02
One day. When we arrived, my mom told me
“There are still mangoes from my grandmother here”

131
12:03 --> 12:04
And my mom showed them to me

132
12:05 --> 12:10
They came by donkey, sometimes 5 or 6 donkeys.

133
12:12 --> 12:13
To take mango from here

134
12:14 --> 12:19
Although it is far away, we always come and suffer a lot

135
12:20 --> 12:23
Sometimes the mangoes fall on the road, yes.

136
12:24 --> 12:26
There are still mangoes from my grandmother.

137
12:27 --> 12:29
we are Pausayu from Usijouje´

138
12:30 --> 12:33
same now let's

139
12:35 --> 12:42
To see. That is, to see more places for them
learn more about our culture

140
12:43 --> 12:44
and that also

141
12:45 --> 12:49
It remains engraved, for the new generation

142
12:50 --> 12:53
Also for, children, yes children

143
12:54 --> 13:02
So we will continue exploring, of course, we must train
to the children and tell them what life was like for our ancestors

144
13:03 --> 13:09
So that they keep what we are, that they are not ashamed
of culture when they go to the city

145
13:10 --> 13:11
Totally true

146
13:12 --> 13:18
They don't want to wear our clothes anymore, it embarrasses them,
they are going to wear pants when they leave

147
13:19 --> 13:24
That is why it is necessary to preserve what we are

148
13:25 --> 13:26
we shouldn't be ashamed

149
13:27 --> 13:31
Rather, rather, the arijunas are more interested
(person who is not wayuu)

150
13:32 --> 13:34
We don't care sometimes

151
13:35 --> 13:39
We don't give it importance, if we are the ones
selfless and our children

152
13:40 --> 13:43
Because? Because of the technology, yes.

153
13:44 --> 13:48
That is the cause, as you already know the technology
children are no longer interested in anything

154
13:49 --> 13:56
They no longer want to put on the blanket but pants, they are
cell phone earring

155
13:58 --> 14:05
That is why it is necessary to talk to the children, train them
and instill in them

156
14:06 --> 14:10
Values such as solidarity, because now being supportive
it is very necessary

157
14:13 --> 14:15
Solidarity is our greatest wealth

158
15:17 --> 15:19
Can't see a bit

159
15:20 --> 15:23
Yes, you can see it, but it is prohibited

160
15:28 --> 15:31
There are Maaiku's footprints when he injured Wolunka

161
15:32 --> 15:33
where is it?

162
15:34 --> 15:39
It's on the other side, up there? No, it's from the other side
for that rubble

163
15:40 --> 15:43
I thought it was from this side, how it came out of the water

164
15:44 --> 15:47
Not because it came from there and I threw it there

165
15:48 --> 15:50
She was there, yes she was bathing

166
15:51 --> 15:56
So I throw it to her there, and she woke up with the wound, yes.
And He sat there, yes.

167
15:59 --> 16:02
She went crying to father Juya,

168
16:02 --> 16:04
bled out right there

169
16:06 --> 16:11
Yes, she got to the water and of course, if they hurt her
right there that's why the blood reached the water

170
16:12 --> 16:15
On that side, just below you can see the blood

171
16:16 --> 16:19
They threw the date there, and the tracks can still be seen

172
16:26 --> 16:27
So it happened with Wolunka

173
16:35 --> 16:36
this is mayo

174
16:38 --> 16:43
The mayo is like the soursop, with which juice is made

175
17:05 --> 17:06
wild mayo

176
17:15 --> 17:16
That is wild guanaba

177
17:19 --> 17:21
What do they say? Where are we going now?

178
17:23 --> 17:26
For there, we continue, by car or walking, of course by car.

179
17:27 --> 17:29
What's the name of the place? alewalu
