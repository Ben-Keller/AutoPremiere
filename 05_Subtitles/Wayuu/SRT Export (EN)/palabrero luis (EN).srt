1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We need you to tell us about jawapi (traditional medicine)
What pregnant women and sick people take

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to talk about our life

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
My name is Luis angel from eirüku (family lineage) “uriana”
I am from here

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Our life in the past from which we grew

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
was immersed in medicinal plants
thanks to our grandparents and uncles

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Everything you see here on earth is very important.
For the Wayuu culture

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
All the plants that you see here serve as food
And medicine for us

8
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We eat the fruits of teasel and trupillo (a kind of mesquite)

9
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Being pütchipü (community mediator)
has allowed me to understand, comprehend

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and resolve conflicts between different families

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Through dialogue and listening to the problem

12
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
All the plants you just saw, we use it
To ease the pain of our body

13
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
To ease the pain of our body after
to graze or work

14
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Plants protect us from the sun, that's why we consume it.

15
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And what is the role you have in conflicts as a mediator?

16
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I am the one who should speak to give you a solution
to the problem or conflict

17
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So that there can be respect
And a healthy coexistence between us

18
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Now let's talk about a topic I've been talking about
in other communities

19
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It is about the wind turbines where there is an active conflict

20
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Does the mediator have an important role in this conflict?

21
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The role of the mediator is neutral

22
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What else did they give you when you started to be a mediator?

23
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I took the medicinal plants that my grandmother gave me

24
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So that my word would carry weight and respect when
resolving a problem

25
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
My body is very strong no matter if
I’m under great pressure from a group of people

26
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It prepares me to have a good oratory when speaking

27
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Now something you want to tell us
Or some message for the people of the world

28
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Good for you gringos who come from afar

29
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I like to show you part of my customs and beliefs

30
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I feel happy to see you come from afar

31
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Despite not knowing where you come from

32
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
My life consists of dialoguing and speaking for others
In times of conflict

33
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Watch over my relatives as a mediator

34
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I am here to help my friends, nephews and grandchildren
If they get to fight

35
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
To give them a solution to your problem
I am always ready to speak for them

36
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What I don't know about you gringos,
is to speak your language and your life

37
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
In the future I will come to help you

38
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
that seems good to me

39
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Because I have my grandchildren who are suffering

40
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Because we don't have a job to survive

41
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
please tell us your name again

42
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I am going to tell you my name so that you know me

43
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
They call me Luis angel uriana

44
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
My eirüku (family lineage) is represented by the rabbit (uriana)

45
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Thank you thank you very much
