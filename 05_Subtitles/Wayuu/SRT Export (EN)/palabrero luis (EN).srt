1
00:04 --> 00:10
We need you to tell us about jawapi (traditional medicine)
What pregnant women and sick people take

2
00:16 --> 00:20
I'm going to talk about our life

3
00:23 --> 00:32
My name is Luis angel from eirüku (family lineage) “uriana”
I am from here

4
00:42 --> 00:46
Our life in the past from which we grew

5
00:52 --> 00:57
was immersed in medicinal plants
thanks to our grandparents and uncles

6
01:15 --> 01:21
Everything you see here on earth is very important.
For the Wayuu culture

7
01:40 --> 01:45
All the plants that you see here serve as food
And medicine for us

8
01:46 --> 011:48
We eat the fruits of teasel and trupillo (a kind of mesquite)

9
02:10 --> 02:15
Being pütchipü (community mediator)
has allowed me to understand, comprehend

10
02:16 --> 02:20
and resolve conflicts between different families

11
02:21 --> 02:27
Through dialogue and listening to the problem

12
02:58 --> 03:03
All the plants you just saw, we use it
To ease the pain of our body

13
03:04 --> 03:11
To ease the pain of our body after
to graze or work

14
03:10 --> 03:14
Plants protect us from the sun, that's why we consume it.

15
03:42 --> 03:47
And what is the role you have in conflicts as a mediator?

16
03:57 --> 04:03
I am the one who should speak to give you a solution
to the problem or conflict

17
04:04 --> 04:09
So that there can be respect
And a healthy coexistence between us

18
04:28 --> 04:32
Now let's talk about a topic I've been talking about
in other communities

19
04:33 --> 04:37
It is about the wind turbines where there is an active conflict

20
04:38 --> 04:41
Does the mediator have an important role in this conflict?

21
04:43 --> 04:47
The role of the mediator is neutral

22
06:47 --> 06:50
What else did they give you when you started to be a mediator?

23
06:51 --> 06:55
I took the medicinal plants that my grandmother gave me

24
06:57 --> 07:02
So that my word would carry weight and respect when
resolving a problem

25
07:03 --> 07:09
My body is very strong no matter if
I’m under great pressure from a group of people

26
07:10 --> 07:13
It prepares me to have a good oratory when speaking

27
07:27 --> 07:31
Now something you want to tell us
Or some message for the people of the world

28
07:42 --> 07:46
Good for you gringos who come from afar

29
07:47 --> 07:51
I like to show you part of my customs and beliefs

30
07:52 --> 07:54
I feel happy to see you come from afar

31
07:56 --> 07:59
Despite not knowing where you come from

32
08:00 --> 08:06
My life consists of dialoguing and speaking for others
In times of conflict

33
08:07 --> 08:10
Watch over my relatives as a mediator

34
08:11 --> 08:14
I am here to help my friends, nephews and grandchildren
If they get to fight

35
08:15 --> 08:20
To give them a solution to your problem
I am always ready to speak for them

36
08:25 --> 08:30
What I don't know about you gringos,
is to speak your language and your life

37
08:40 --> 08:42
In the future I will come to help you

38
08:43 --> 08:45
that seems good to me

39
08:46 --> 08:49
Because I have my grandchildren who are suffering

40
08:50 --> 08:53
Because we don't have a job to survive

41
09:22 --> 09:26
please tell us your name again

42
09:39 --> 09:43
I am going to tell you my name so that you know me

43
09:44 --> 09:48
They call me Luis angel uriana

44
09:50 --> 09:55
My eirüku (family lineage) is represented by the rabbit (uriana)

45
09:56 --> 09:59
Thank you thank you very much
