1
00:00:07,916 --> 00:00:09,750
I find it very interesting

2
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:12,250
That the Wayuu people hardly have

3
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:13,500
A border.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,916
Yes, that's precisely it.

5
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,333
Yes, precisely, this is the theory
and this is the practice.

6
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,916
So, I have both of them

7
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,875
And sometimes, as always,
it's something that is said with pride.

8
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:26,083
it's not like my culture is binational,

9
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:30,083
but that pride is something that truly costs.

10
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:34,083
I mean, for example, to me
I had my elementary school in Venezuela

11
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:39,000
when I came to Colombia I studied high school,
but with the Venezuelan documents and also

12
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:42,458
I have the Colombian,
I have both documents and when I finish

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,208
the high school

14
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,000
that paper doesn't do me much good,

15
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,041
because i was hoping that, taking into account

16
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:53,041
is also an idea from our culture, at least I would say

17
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:57,041
Let's transfer the paperwork to the Colombian and cancel the Venezuelan.

18
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:02,333
But bureaucracy does not allow
that and we are that,

19
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,750
we are a victim

20
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:07,458
of a border that we did not want to enter,
we did not put.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,375
So that's the other side of saying
I am binational,

22
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:16,125
is negative.

23
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:22,416
So yes, it could,
no problem, I could answer.

24
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, first of all, let's start with which one?

25
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:32,125
is your name and what you do.

26
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,208
Well, what is your name?

27
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:36,250
Where are we and what do you do?

28
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:40,375
Well, my name is Neko Agustin Pio.

29
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:45,208
We were in Manaos, La Guajira, in the media guajira.

30
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,125
And what do I do?

31
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:51,708
Well, I'm involved in several things, in fact, things

32
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:57,125
that are related to cultural conservation,
in this case,

33
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:01,333
in particular the culture to which I belong
me, which is the Wayuu culture.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,625
Then,

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,708
Precisely, I can say that I am dedicating myself

36
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:10,500
to the creation of audiovisual content, producing short films.

37
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:14,125
and to literature, writing,

38
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,666
passing

39
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:21,625
the oral story from our culture to writing.

40
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:26,083
So it is also a way to
of systematizing knowledge

41
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:31,083
and wisdom that have been bequeathed to us by these people who

42
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:36,416
that has been so difficult to continue.

43
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,750
If you are, where are you writing,

44
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,208
putting that information?

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Now,

46
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,875
for now I also write literary

47
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:52,625
works, very personal, like my name.

48
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:58,166
I have already had the opportunity to,
to publish two books,

49
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,125
one I worked as a collaborator and in another
because I worked in a way that

50
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:07,791
Single, a single actor, in which

51
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:13,250
have been my big accomplishments, writing.

52
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,875
And also

53
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,250
I am working with Wikipedia.

54
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,791
I am one of the collaborators who have

55
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:25,125
We are building Wikipedia on xxx ... it's official.

56
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,208
We already have Wikipedia in xxx

57
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,125
and this is a project

58
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,583
that has given me the space for the things that I write about

59
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:39,041
can be in a library, in this case
in a virtual library,

60
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,791
And I have been able to write about

61
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,791
five specific articles.

62
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:50,333
Well, tell me a little bit about your beliefs, that is

63
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:56,041
Where are you from?
that's what we're talking about, Nacional

64
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:59,000
from that border.

65
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:04,083
Well, more than a belief, it is a reality.

66
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,791
The truth is a reality.

67
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,208
Today our culture

68
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,208
is on the Colombian side

69
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:16,208
and on the Venezuelan side
and that is to say that when it was

70
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,208
the border between Colombia and Venezuela was established,

71
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,041
It was not taken into account that there were

72
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:27,041
a culture that was divided
and this territorial division

73
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:30,708
caused a portion to remain in Colombia
and a portion in Venezuela.

74
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,666
But our culture as such

75
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:37,041
not visible, did not see that border

76
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:43,791
and that is why many of the Wayuu brothers and sisters still visit their
family members who are in that part and then the

77
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:49,000
who are there visit them here, and with time
had access difficulties,

78
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:53,208
but they managed to do, to go there and to come here

79
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:58,458
and in that process

80
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,333
also

81
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:05,916
my family was at one time
in Venezuela

82
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,375
in search of opportunities, that one moment

83
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,000
this part of Colombia, La Guajira, its economy and its

84
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,458
Didn't depend on Colombia, but on Venezuela.

85
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:20,208
It's something, it's quite a situation,

86
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,375
as we would say, quite complicated.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,875
depend on another country
and not depend on the country to which it belongs.

88
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:34,083
And in that, let's say in those decades,

89
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:37,250
that La Guajira depended on Venezuela,
and was at its peak,

90
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,791
my parents were

91
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,166
to the neighboring country and there

92
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,458
one thing that is very difficult
and one of the things there is

93
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,750
is that indigenous people who do not speak
Spanish

94
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,375
they find it difficult to understand the political issue

95
00:05:56,916 --> 00:06:01,500
and that's why the politicking, the candidates
political groups collect individuals, groups,

96
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:07,333
to the indigenous people, to the communities that don't have ID cards, they provide identification through

97
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,541
their contacts information, in this case from the Registrar's Office.

98
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:18,000
And in this situation

99
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:22,125
My parents have their Venezuelan ID card and also their Colombian ID card.

100
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,000
I was originally born here in Colombia,

101
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,333
but my childhood was in Venezuela.

102
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,333
So I was able to

103
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,625
once when my parents came to Venezuela,

104
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:39,000
also obtained their documents
and I was also registered in Venezuela,

105
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,458
so also had this Venezuelan document
and with this document I studied

106
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,250
and finished elementary school.

107
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,125
When my parents went back to Colombia again

108
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:57,083
To access education was very difficult, you know, starting from scratch.

109
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,208
I was already 13 years old,
by then it was already very complicated for me

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
start, burn the entire high school and what was done

111
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:10,625
was, what I was allowed to do in school.

112
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,041
I was told,

113
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:16,250
you can continue studying with the venezuelan school
as a foreigner here in Colombia,

114
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,583
which in due course I accepted,

115
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,000
having faith that in the future

116
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,166
a paperwork transfer was to be made.

117
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:31,000
That is to say, my document,
my Venezuelan studies will be transferred to the Colombian one

118
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:36,208
and I graduated four years ago
and this transfer has not been possible.

119
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,125
Then,

120
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:43,333
I finished my high school with the Venezuelan
and in Colombia I was recognized as

121
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:47,166
as a Venezuelan high school graduate,
a foreign bachelor's degree.

122
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:52,458
And then with the Colombian, this year it is
that I am taking a validation course

123
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,291
to come back again,
studying and finishing high school

124
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,166
and access to higher education

125
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:03,875
as a Colombian citizen, which

126
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,458
so what I was saying just now,

127
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,166
one says with pride my people, my culture,

128
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,875
my people, my Wayuu nation is binational,

129
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:19,041
But that pride, in reality, is something very abrupt.

130
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,125
and what I said I have the document, what I have,
and to date

131
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:28,958
I have not been able to access to study any
career because it is very difficult

132
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,750
to be, to be a...

133
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:36,041
to have ended up as a Venezuelan, although if there are

134
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:41,791
opportunities, but they are very scarce,
then not for me,

135
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:46,083
is not favorable to me
and that's something that happened to me,

136
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,208
but it is also a situation that happens to hundreds

137
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,500
of people here in La Guajira.

138
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,125
Well

139
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,166
tell me a little bit about for you

140
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:01,333
What does it mean to be a Wayuu?

141
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,916
What does it mean to me to be Wayuu?

142
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,375
I believe that

143
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,375
in that case that our culture has taught us that

144
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,083
our way of seeing life is in a spiral

145
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,750
and in this spiral we, life

146
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,833
existence, takes a journey,

147
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:29,166
we have a beginning and that beginning, that origin, is what we

148
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,291
is behind us

149
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:36,041
it is the case that if a
wayuu

150
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,750
suppose he dies in Venezuela, his people,

151
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,916
its root is going to look for it
and will bury him with his ancestors.

152
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,666
So, taking into account that way of thinking,

153
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,083
we also believe that there are things
that are previously destined

154
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:58,875
and having that way of looking at life,

155
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:05,833
I think that each of us is placed at a point where we are going

156
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,625
in some way to
make things interesting or make an impact,

157
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:14,333
where we go out, where xxx,

158
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,208
where God places us

159
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:23,541
and that's why I'm proud of it, for everything

160
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:28,541
what we are,
what constitutes us as persevering people,

161
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,750
as individuals, as a struggling community

162
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,250
to maintain its identity

163
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:38,291
and to maintain,

164
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,916
for maintaining a culture that we have been
building

165
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,166
o that our ancestors built for us

166
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,125
and which are now given to us as a legacy.

167
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:52,250
That of nomadic

168
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,083
Can we talk about that?

169
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,250
Well, what, if our culture is nomadic,

170
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,208
because we are a semi-nomadic culture,

171
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,041
it is said,

172
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,083
Anthropology says that we have been coming down

173
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,666
of the Perijá highlands,

174
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,958
the column that crosses Colombia

175
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,083
anthropology, according to studies.

176
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,250
say that others of us are coming down from that hill,

177
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,500
of that column of hills

178
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:25,291
and we got off and got to this one,

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,750
This provincial, arid land,

180
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:35,708
and our culture has taken over that place and

181
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,083
we can also see that feature

182
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,666
of the high guajira, Punta Colombia, the Punta Colombia of the

183
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:46,500
from the point that it is quite far from here

184
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:50,875
we have been going down,
that is why our culture, our nation,

185
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:55,833
has already reached much further south,

186
00:11:56,416 --> 00:12:02,166
and in that, let's say

187
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:03,541
in that

188
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,708
way of coming down from the top to the bottom

189
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,208
has been given through the practice of
of being semi-nomadic

190
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,250
because our grandparents and ancestors

191
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,083
were behind

192
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,958
from where the rain was prosperous.

193
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:26,041
And so when there was a drought in a place,

194
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:29,541
They immediately searched for the place where the rain was

195
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,666
Then and then they passed that point

196
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:37,583
and when here the rain ended
passed by and went after it.

197
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:41,125
But the point where they knew they had arrived,

198
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:45,291
that point already belongs to them,
then it ends up being a waypoint.

199
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,333
And there is a moment
As far as they can go,

200
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:54,166
as being

201
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,041
migrants.

202
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:59,041
Somehow, behind the rain,
comes to a point where they decide

203
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,625
return to the point of origin, to the starting point.

204
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:07,041
So, to get to that point
or those points where they

205
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:11,125
they are positioning themselves, they are leaving

206
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,125
inheritance, they are leaving

207
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:18,791
children, they are leaving other people behind, so

208
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:24,000
those points become points on a route

209
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,666
From a semi-nomadic community, from a community that is

210
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,541
constantly traveling and on the move.

211
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,208
It's a bit of a spiral.

212
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,250
Can you tell me a little bit about

213
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,416
your intention of preserving the culture?

214
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:47,458
how are you doing that, and what importance

215
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,541
does it have to preserve that culture?"

216
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,708
On a personal level

217
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:57,125
I love very much

218
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,125
to be wayuu and part of this love

219
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,125
by the identity that one has, it is,

220
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:11,333
is to recover things that have been lost

221
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,375
and things that are being lost due to different

222
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,041
reasons.

223
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,041
We have one of those punctual reasons
that has caused us to lose,

224
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:26,875
has been the need
to emigrate in search of opportunities.

225
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:31,791
We have the specific cases of the Wayuu,
of the communities

226
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,916
who migrated to Venezuela, to the cities of Venezuela

227
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,500
when they were at their peak,

228
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:40,125
but when they

229
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,916
returned to the Guajira again, to the land,

230
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,500
The generations that were born in Venezuela no longer spoke xxx.

231
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:50,833
So they would move in search of an opportunity, but that opportunity

232
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:54,208
ends up harming them.

233
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,083
Like losing the language, speech, and another one as well

234
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,541
is that the territories and

235
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,458
globalization has also touched it

236
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,250
and also

237
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,541
In our territory it is sometimes necessary to go there

238
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,750
to study, or for a god job

239
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:21,041
and in this way to look for opportunities outside

240
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,000
we make it cause that damage

241
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:27,166
I told you about earlier, of losing something

242
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,250
from ourselves

243
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,583
So there are many reasons

244
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,500
for that loss. Also,

245
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,208
Also, the Wayuu society itself has lost certain values.

246
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:44,083
we have let ourselves be carried away by a thought
that is not like us

247
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:49,125
because our culture is a collective culture
that does everything in collectivism.

248
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,333
Lately

249
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,041
already by

250
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:57,083
the entries of large multinationals,

251
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:01,000
has caused the Wayuu to become selfish

252
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,208
and to the point where there is no more unity

253
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,166
and then that
causes conflicts between communities.

254
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,958
The famous conflicts between clans
that among the Wayuu themselves they kill each other, for the sake of a good

255
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,333
or for the benefits that this can generate.

256
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:24,458
And while that is happening

257
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,041
the way of teaching is also changing.

258
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:32,375
It is no longer taught that you should love your neighbor
how it used to be taught,

259
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:36,083
that you must have empathy first and foremost,
This is no longer taught.

260
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,500
So the new generations are being born

261
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:43,166
without having those values that were and had

262
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:47,666
our culture,
then the way of thinking is selfishness,

263
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,875
already everyone only assures

264
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:52,583
what it is

265
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,041
own, what is yours and what you do not share with others.

266
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,875
there is no longer any empathy

267
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:02,958
And that also generates that among the Wayuu themselves, the same culture

268
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,041
be generated

269
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,125
that we also lose part of our identity,

270
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,333
because already at this moment,

271
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:21,291
The grandparents who sat in front of a bonfire to teach us, to tell us stories

272
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,125
That used to generate reflection is no longer being done

273
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:30,041
and then there is no way to recover those values

274
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,416
Or a way of saying, 'Look, we are Wayuu, there is

275
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:38,916
no need to kill each other

276
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:43,166
We want to do the work that the old man did,
our ancestors,

277
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:46,250
our grandfather, in front of a campfire,

278
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,875
teaching the little boys, the young men

279
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:54,583
So that they always maintain that unity,
that love, that empathy.

280
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:58,958
We want to do that
through audiovisual creation,

281
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:04,083
through the short film, our short film,
that space to generate a reflection

282
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,500
both the Wayuu person

283
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,250
as the outsider, the foreigner.

284
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,333
And I have had the opportunity to

285
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,416
to learn a little and I have come

286
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:19,041
doing interesting things.

287
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,666
And it is the same thing that happens

288
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:27,500
with writing,
with what I have been writing, it is

289
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:32,083
a way to grasp this oral knowledge
and systematize it

290
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:36,833
Take it to a book,
because one of the advantages of an oral tradition

291
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:41,166
is that over time it gets lost or changed or then
is no longer there.

292
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,166
And so let's say that in those two points

293
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,791
I have concentrated more on contributing

294
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:54,166
to this Colombian identity.

295
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:57,875
You can quickly describe where we are now,

296
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:01,875
as in the urban house.
and the one in front of the ranchería.

297
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,541
So where we are, it's going to be a little bit different.

298
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,708
and reflect the difference between the two.

299
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:17,083
Well, in Manaure one calls it an urban zone,

300
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,875
practically all over La Guajira

301
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:25,500
One calls it an urban area,
but it is really not so much urban as semi-urban.

302
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,958
In this case, this house of ours
is in a village,

303
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,458
in the village

304
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,083
as we use the term to refer to it, but

305
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,875
we have maintained

306
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,541
our ways of making traditional houses

307
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:52,916
and for this space that is here
although it is in the urban zone, we call it an urban zone,

308
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
but really the house, the roof, everything

309
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,708
it's like something traditional still

310
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,958
and therefore the differences,

311
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,666
The difference is that in rural areas, there is no electricity, no power, no internet.

312
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,916
and that would be the only difference.

313
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,250
Well, that way there is also much less noise.

314
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,083
Yes, there are also advantages

315
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,291
nature is more

316
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,208
present in

317
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:28,125
rural areas than in urban areas.

318
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,000
Can you describe who xxx is and

319
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,041
What does it mean to you, to the Wayuu people?

320
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:40,291
xxx the word for xxx in spanish is madre tierra

321
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,208
or xxx can also mean only

322
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,916
a grain of sand,

323
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,958
but it can also mean
or it can also be assimilated

324
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,166
to say planet,

325
00:20:56,708 --> 00:21:00,541
because the name of this planet, planet Earth,

326
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,958
is related to this concept.

327
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,583
So when we say xxx
We are not only referring to Mother Earth,

328
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,583
but also to the planet itself.

329
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:15,000
Then that
is the meaning of the word xxx

330
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,333
and for us that is xxx, well xxx

331
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,458
is the mother of us.

332
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,500
It has already been explained to them

333
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:30,083
that we, for us
our origin is in different generations.

334
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,291
First, they create

335
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,125
or first, life arises

336
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:39,000
from light

337
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,291
that is born of the night, the darkness.

338
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,541
From that it is born.

339
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,666
Then comes a generation, which is the generation

340
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,750
of the elements

341
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:57,166
and then the sacred places, then xxx

342
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:01,083
meet xxx

343
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:07,708
Being rain, among them
there is a love affair and the fruit of that love affair are the plants,

344
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,916
large plants

345
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,500
and birds.

346
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,083
But mother, xxx,

347
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,166
felt sad because the plants were

348
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:20,541
immobile.

349
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,958
I wanted children who were independent,
they thought,

350
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,500
And then

351
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,083
had children.

352
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,500
And that's where we went out. The

353
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,625
human beings, the Wayuu.

354
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:36,500
And so for our worldview, Mma is
our mother,

355
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:41,166
the one that connects us, the one that has given us

356
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:45,041
practically everything, because if

357
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:48,750
we ask ourselves where the things I have come from
or the things I consume

358
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:53,125
come from mother earth.
