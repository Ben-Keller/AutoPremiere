1
00:00:07:22 --> 00:00:09:18
I find it very interesting

2
00:00:09:19 --> 00:00:12:06
That the Wayuu people hardly have

3
00:00:12:16 --> 00:00:13:12
A border.

4
00:00:13:12 --> 00:00:15:22
Yes, that's precisely it.

5
00:00:15:29 --> 00:00:18:08
Yes, precisely, this is the theory
and this is the practice.

6
00:00:18:21 --> 00:00:20:22
So, I have both of them

7
00:00:20:27 --> 00:00:23:21
And sometimes, as always,
it's something that is said with pride.

8
00:00:23:22 --> 00:00:26:02
it's not like my culture is binational,

9
00:00:27:07 --> 00:00:30:02
but that pride is something that truly costs.

10
00:00:30:22 --> 00:00:33:26
I mean, for example, to me
I had my elementary school in Venezuela

11
00:00:34:27 --> 00:00:39:00
when I came to Colombia I studied high school,
but with the Venezuelan documents and also

12
00:00:39:03 --> 00:00:42:11
I have the Colombian,
I have both documents and when I finish

13
00:00:42:12 --> 00:00:43:29
the high school

14
00:00:45:13 --> 00:00:48:00
that paper doesn't do me much good,

15
00:00:48:01 --> 00:00:50:01
because i was hoping that, taking into account

16
00:00:50:05 --> 00:00:52:25
is also an idea from our culture, at least I would say

17
00:00:53:03 --> 00:00:57:01
Let's transfer the paperwork to the Colombian and cancel the Venezuelan.

18
00:00:57:23 --> 00:01:02:08
But bureaucracy does not allow
that and we are that,

19
00:01:03:09 --> 00:01:04:18
we are a victim

20
00:01:04:19 --> 00:01:07:11
of a border that we did not want to enter,
we did not put.

21
00:01:08:24 --> 00:01:12:09
So that's the other side of saying
I am binational,

22
00:01:13:14 --> 00:01:15:27
is negative.

23
00:01:19:02 --> 00:01:22:10
So yes, it could,
no problem, I could answer.

24
00:01:22:27 --> 00:01:28:00
Well, first of all, let's start with which one?

25
00:01:28:01 --> 00:01:31:27
is your name and what you do.

26
00:01:31:28 --> 00:01:32:29
Well, what is your name?

27
00:01:32:29 --> 00:01:36:06
Where are we and what do you do?

28
00:01:36:07 --> 00:01:40:09
Well, my name is Neko Agustin Pio.

29
00:01:41:15 --> 00:01:44:29
We were in Manaos, La Guajira, in the media guajira.

30
00:01:47:06 --> 00:01:48:03
And what do I do?

31
00:01:48:03 --> 00:01:51:17
Well, I'm involved in several things, in fact, things

32
00:01:52:02 --> 00:01:56:27
that are related to cultural conservation,
in this case,

33
00:01:57:03 --> 00:02:01:08
in particular the culture to which I belong
me, which is the Wayuu culture.

34
00:02:02:00 --> 00:02:03:15
Then,

35
00:02:04:00 --> 00:02:06:17
Precisely, I can say that I am dedicating myself

36
00:02:07:05 --> 00:02:10:12
to the creation of audiovisual content, producing short films.

37
00:02:10:29 --> 00:02:14:03
and to literature, writing,

38
00:02:15:08 --> 00:02:17:16
passing

39
00:02:17:27 --> 00:02:21:15
the oral story from our culture to writing.

40
00:02:22:05 --> 00:02:26:02
So it is also a way to
of systematizing knowledge

41
00:02:26:03 --> 00:02:30:26
and wisdom that have been bequeathed to us by these people who

42
00:02:31:21 --> 00:02:36:10
that has been so difficult to continue.

43
00:02:36:11 --> 00:02:38:18
If you are, where are you writing,

44
00:02:39:17 --> 00:02:41:29
putting that information?

45
00:02:42:24 --> 00:02:44:00
Now,

46
00:02:44:01 --> 00:02:46:21
for now I also write literary

47
00:02:48:05 --> 00:02:52:15
works, very personal, like my name.

48
00:02:52:16 --> 00:02:57:28
I have already had the opportunity to,
to publish two books,

49
00:02:58:12 --> 00:03:02:03
one I worked as a collaborator and in another
because I worked in a way that

50
00:03:03:29 --> 00:03:07:19
Single, a single actor, in which

51
00:03:09:07 --> 00:03:13:06
have been my big accomplishments, writing.

52
00:03:14:01 --> 00:03:15:21
And also

53
00:03:16:05 --> 00:03:18:06
I am working with Wikipedia.

54
00:03:18:15 --> 00:03:21:19
I am one of the collaborators who have

55
00:03:21:23 --> 00:03:24:27
We are building Wikipedia on xxx ... it's official.

56
00:03:25:04 --> 00:03:26:29
We already have Wikipedia in xxx

57
00:03:27:27 --> 00:03:29:27
and this is a project

58
00:03:29:28 --> 00:03:33:14
that has given me the space for the things that I write about

59
00:03:34:01 --> 00:03:38:25
can be in a library, in this case
in a virtual library,

60
00:03:39:06 --> 00:03:41:19
And I have been able to write about

61
00:03:42:08 --> 00:03:44:19
five specific articles.

62
00:03:44:20 --> 00:03:50:08
Well, tell me a little bit about your beliefs, that is

63
00:03:51:15 --> 00:03:55:25
Where are you from?
that's what we're talking about, Nacional

64
00:03:56:03 --> 00:03:58:24
from that border.

65
00:04:00:03 --> 00:04:03:26
Well, more than a belief, it is a reality.

66
00:04:03:27 --> 00:04:05:19
The truth is a reality.

67
00:04:05:20 --> 00:04:08:05
Today our culture

68
00:04:10:08 --> 00:04:11:29
is on the Colombian side

69
00:04:11:29 --> 00:04:16:05
and on the Venezuelan side
and that is to say that when it was

70
00:04:16:21 --> 00:04:18:29
the border between Colombia and Venezuela was established,

71
00:04:20:11 --> 00:04:22:01
It was not taken into account that there were

72
00:04:22:01 --> 00:04:27:01
a culture that was divided
and this territorial division

73
00:04:27:02 --> 00:04:30:17
caused a portion to remain in Colombia
and a portion in Venezuela.

74
00:04:31:06 --> 00:04:33:16
But our culture as such

75
00:04:33:17 --> 00:04:36:25
not visible, did not see that border

76
00:04:37:18 --> 00:04:43:19
and that is why many of the Wayuu brothers and sisters still visit their
family members who are in that part and then the

77
00:04:43:20 --> 00:04:48:24
who are there visit them here, and with time
had access difficulties,

78
00:04:49:20 --> 00:04:53:05
but they managed to do, to go there and to come here

79
00:04:54:03 --> 00:04:58:11
and in that process

80
00:05:00:11 --> 00:05:01:08
also

81
00:05:01:09 --> 00:05:05:22
my family was at one time
in Venezuela

82
00:05:06:18 --> 00:05:09:09
in search of opportunities, that one moment

83
00:05:09:28 --> 00:05:12:24
this part of Colombia, La Guajira, its economy and its

84
00:05:12:25 --> 00:05:15:11
Didn't depend on Colombia, but on Venezuela.

85
00:05:16:23 --> 00:05:20:05
It's something, it's quite a situation,

86
00:05:20:06 --> 00:05:25:09
as we would say, quite complicated.

87
00:05:25:24 --> 00:05:29:21
depend on another country
and not depend on the country to which it belongs.

88
00:05:30:09 --> 00:05:33:26
And in that, let's say in those decades,

89
00:05:34:01 --> 00:05:37:06
that La Guajira depended on Venezuela,
and was at its peak,

90
00:05:37:26 --> 00:05:40:19
my parents were

91
00:05:40:20 --> 00:05:42:28
to the neighboring country and there

92
00:05:44:08 --> 00:05:47:11
one thing that is very difficult
and one of the things there is

93
00:05:47:12 --> 00:05:52:18
is that indigenous people who do not speak
Spanish

94
00:05:53:14 --> 00:05:56:09
they find it difficult to understand the political issue

95
00:05:56:22 --> 00:06:01:12
and that's why the politicking, the candidates
political groups collect individuals, groups,

96
00:06:01:13 --> 00:06:07:08
to the indigenous people, to the communities that don't have ID cards, they provide identification through

97
00:06:08:18 --> 00:06:11:13
their contacts information, in this case from the Registrar's Office.

98
00:06:12:07 --> 00:06:18:00
And in this situation

99
00:06:18:01 --> 00:06:22:03
My parents have their Venezuelan ID card and also their Colombian ID card.

100
00:06:22:20 --> 00:06:25:00
I was originally born here in Colombia,

101
00:06:26:03 --> 00:06:28:08
but my childhood was in Venezuela.

102
00:06:28:09 --> 00:06:30:08
So I was able to

103
00:06:30:21 --> 00:06:33:15
once when my parents came to Venezuela,

104
00:06:34:19 --> 00:06:39:00
also obtained their documents
and I was also registered in Venezuela,

105
00:06:39:18 --> 00:06:44:11
so also had this Venezuelan document
and with this document I studied

106
00:06:45:14 --> 00:06:48:06
and finished elementary school.

107
00:06:48:07 --> 00:06:51:03
When my parents went back to Colombia again

108
00:06:53:08 --> 00:06:57:02
To access education was very difficult, you know, starting from scratch.

109
00:06:57:18 --> 00:07:00:29
I was already 13 years old,
by then it was already very complicated for me

110
00:07:01:00 --> 00:07:05:24
start, burn the entire high school and what was done

111
00:07:05:25 --> 00:07:10:15
was, what I was allowed to do in school.

112
00:07:10:26 --> 00:07:12:01
I was told,

113
00:07:12:02 --> 00:07:16:06
you can continue studying with the venezuelan school
as a foreigner here in Colombia,

114
00:07:17:05 --> 00:07:19:14
which in due course I accepted,

115
00:07:20:18 --> 00:07:23:00
having faith that in the future

116
00:07:23:16 --> 00:07:25:28
a paperwork transfer was to be made.

117
00:07:26:17 --> 00:07:31:00
That is to say, my document,
my Venezuelan studies will be transferred to the Colombian one

118
00:07:31:29 --> 00:07:35:29
and I graduated four years ago
and this transfer has not been possible.

119
00:07:36:18 --> 00:07:39:03
Then,

120
00:07:39:22 --> 00:07:43:08
I finished my high school with the Venezuelan
and in Colombia I was recognized as

121
00:07:43:15 --> 00:07:47:04
as a Venezuelan high school graduate,
a foreign bachelor's degree.

122
00:07:48:02 --> 00:07:52:11
And then with the Colombian, this year it is
that I am taking a validation course

123
00:07:52:26 --> 00:07:56:07
to come back again,
studying and finishing high school

124
00:07:56:27 --> 00:07:59:04
and access to higher education

125
00:07:59:14 --> 00:08:03:21
as a Colombian citizen, which

126
00:08:04:10 --> 00:08:07:11
so what I was saying just now,

127
00:08:07:21 --> 00:08:11:04
one says with pride my people, my culture,

128
00:08:11:17 --> 00:08:13:21
my people, my Wayuu nation is binational,

129
00:08:14:13 --> 00:08:19:01
But that pride, in reality, is something very abrupt.

130
00:08:19:25 --> 00:08:22:27
and what I said I have the document, what I have,
and to date

131
00:08:22:28 --> 00:08:28:23
I have not been able to access to study any
career because it is very difficult

132
00:08:30:04 --> 00:08:32:18
to be, to be a...

133
00:08:32:19 --> 00:08:35:25
to have ended up as a Venezuelan, although if there are

134
00:08:36:15 --> 00:08:41:19
opportunities, but they are very scarce,
then not for me,

135
00:08:41:25 --> 00:08:46:02
is not favorable to me
and that's something that happened to me,

136
00:08:46:03 --> 00:08:49:05
but it is also a situation that happens to hundreds

137
00:08:50:00 --> 00:08:52:12
of people here in La Guajira.

138
00:08:52:13 --> 00:08:53:27
Well

139
00:08:54:06 --> 00:08:57:04
tell me a little bit about for you

140
00:08:57:05 --> 00:09:01:08
What does it mean to be a Wayuu?

141
00:09:01:09 --> 00:09:04:22
What does it mean to me to be Wayuu?

142
00:09:05:01 --> 00:09:07:09
I believe that

143
00:09:08:06 --> 00:09:12:09
in that case that our culture has taught us that

144
00:09:14:08 --> 00:09:17:02
our way of seeing life is in a spiral

145
00:09:17:27 --> 00:09:21:18
and in this spiral we, life

146
00:09:21:19 --> 00:09:24:20
existence, takes a journey,

147
00:09:25:17 --> 00:09:29:04
we have a beginning and that beginning, that origin, is what we

148
00:09:30:07 --> 00:09:32:07
is behind us

149
00:09:32:08 --> 00:09:36:01
it is the case that if a
wayuu

150
00:09:38:12 --> 00:09:41:18
suppose he dies in Venezuela, his people,

151
00:09:41:19 --> 00:09:44:22
its root is going to look for it
and will bury him with his ancestors.

152
00:09:45:12 --> 00:09:47:16
So, taking into account that way of thinking,

153
00:09:48:18 --> 00:09:53:02
we also believe that there are things
that are previously destined

154
00:09:53:23 --> 00:09:58:21
and having that way of looking at life,

155
00:09:59:17 --> 00:10:05:20
I think that each of us is placed at a point where we are going

156
00:10:06:08 --> 00:10:09:15
in some way to
make things interesting or make an impact,

157
00:10:10:03 --> 00:10:14:08
where we go out, where xxx,

158
00:10:15:10 --> 00:10:17:29
where God places us

159
00:10:18:15 --> 00:10:23:13
and that's why I'm proud of it, for everything

160
00:10:24:15 --> 00:10:28:13
what we are,
what constitutes us as persevering people,

161
00:10:28:14 --> 00:10:31:18
as individuals, as a struggling community

162
00:10:31:19 --> 00:10:34:06
to maintain its identity

163
00:10:35:02 --> 00:10:38:07
and to maintain,

164
00:10:38:08 --> 00:10:41:22
for maintaining a culture that we have been
building

165
00:10:42:14 --> 00:10:44:28
o that our ancestors built for us

166
00:10:44:29 --> 00:10:48:03
and which are now given to us as a legacy.

167
00:10:48:04 --> 00:10:52:06
That of nomadic

168
00:10:53:05 --> 00:10:55:02
Can we talk about that?

169
00:10:55:03 --> 00:10:58:06
Well, what, if our culture is nomadic,

170
00:10:58:07 --> 00:11:00:29
because we are a semi-nomadic culture,

171
00:11:02:08 --> 00:11:02:25
it is said,

172
00:11:02:25 --> 00:11:05:02
Anthropology says that we have been coming down

173
00:11:06:10 --> 00:11:08:16
of the Perijá highlands,

174
00:11:08:17 --> 00:11:11:23
the column that crosses Colombia

175
00:11:13:01 --> 00:11:14:26
anthropology, according to studies.

176
00:11:14:26 --> 00:11:18:06
say that others of us are coming down from that hill,

177
00:11:18:10 --> 00:11:20:12
of that column of hills

178
00:11:20:13 --> 00:11:25:07
and we got off and got to this one,

179
00:11:26:00 --> 00:11:29:18
This provincial, arid land,

180
00:11:30:21 --> 00:11:35:17
and our culture has taken over that place and

181
00:11:36:23 --> 00:11:39:02
we can also see that feature

182
00:11:39:03 --> 00:11:42:16
of the high guajira, Punta Colombia, the Punta Colombia of the

183
00:11:42:28 --> 00:11:46:12
from the point that it is quite far from here

184
00:11:46:13 --> 00:11:50:21
we have been going down,
that is why our culture, our nation,

185
00:11:50:27 --> 00:11:55:20
has already reached much further south,

186
00:11:56:10 --> 00:12:01:28
and in that, let's say

187
00:12:03:02 --> 00:12:03:13
in that

188
00:12:03:13 --> 00:12:06:17
way of coming down from the top to the bottom

189
00:12:07:18 --> 00:12:12:05
has been given through the practice of
of being semi-nomadic

190
00:12:12:19 --> 00:12:15:06
because our grandparents and ancestors

191
00:12:16:19 --> 00:12:18:26
were behind

192
00:12:19:04 --> 00:12:21:23
from where the rain was prosperous.

193
00:12:22:21 --> 00:12:26:01
And so when there was a drought in a place,

194
00:12:26:02 --> 00:12:29:13
They immediately searched for the place where the rain was

195
00:12:29:14 --> 00:12:32:16
Then and then they passed that point

196
00:12:33:02 --> 00:12:37:14
and when here the rain ended
passed by and went after it.

197
00:12:37:25 --> 00:12:41:03
But the point where they knew they had arrived,

198
00:12:41:15 --> 00:12:45:07
that point already belongs to them,
then it ends up being a waypoint.

199
00:12:46:06 --> 00:12:50:08
And there is a moment
As far as they can go,

200
00:12:50:28 --> 00:12:53:28
as being

201
00:12:54:02 --> 00:12:54:25
migrants.

202
00:12:54:26 --> 00:12:59:01
Somehow, behind the rain,
comes to a point where they decide

203
00:12:59:02 --> 00:13:01:15
return to the point of origin, to the starting point.

204
00:13:02:13 --> 00:13:07:01
So, to get to that point
or those points where they

205
00:13:07:02 --> 00:13:10:27
they are positioning themselves, they are leaving

206
00:13:12:16 --> 00:13:15:03
inheritance, they are leaving

207
00:13:15:04 --> 00:13:18:19
children, they are leaving other people behind, so

208
00:13:20:01 --> 00:13:24:00
those points become points on a route

209
00:13:27:19 --> 00:13:30:16
From a semi-nomadic community, from a community that is

210
00:13:30:17 --> 00:13:33:13
constantly traveling and on the move.

211
00:13:33:24 --> 00:13:36:05
It's a bit of a spiral.

212
00:13:37:20 --> 00:13:39:06
Can you tell me a little bit about

213
00:13:39:07 --> 00:13:42:10
your intention of preserving the culture?

214
00:13:43:16 --> 00:13:47:11
how are you doing that, and what importance

215
00:13:47:12 --> 00:13:50:13
does it have to preserve that culture?"

216
00:13:50:14 --> 00:13:52:17
On a personal level

217
00:13:52:26 --> 00:13:57:03
I love very much

218
00:13:57:16 --> 00:14:00:03
to be wayuu and part of this love

219
00:14:02:04 --> 00:14:05:03
by the identity that one has, it is,

220
00:14:05:23 --> 00:14:11:08
is to recover things that have been lost

221
00:14:11:24 --> 00:14:15:09
and things that are being lost due to different

222
00:14:16:14 --> 00:14:18:01
reasons.

223
00:14:18:12 --> 00:14:21:25
We have one of those punctual reasons
that has caused us to lose,

224
00:14:22:08 --> 00:14:26:21
has been the need
to emigrate in search of opportunities.

225
00:14:27:10 --> 00:14:31:19
We have the specific cases of the Wayuu,
of the communities

226
00:14:32:00 --> 00:14:34:22
who migrated to Venezuela, to the cities of Venezuela

227
00:14:35:01 --> 00:14:38:12
when they were at their peak,

228
00:14:39:13 --> 00:14:40:03
but when they

229
00:14:40:03 --> 00:14:42:22
returned to the Guajira again, to the land,

230
00:14:43:14 --> 00:14:46:12
The generations that were born in Venezuela no longer spoke xxx.

231
00:14:47:05 --> 00:14:50:20
So they would move in search of an opportunity, but that opportunity

232
00:14:50:21 --> 00:14:53:29
ends up harming them.

233
00:14:54:00 --> 00:14:58:02
Like losing the language, speech, and another one as well

234
00:14:58:03 --> 00:15:01:13
is that the territories and

235
00:15:03:01 --> 00:15:05:11
globalization has also touched it

236
00:15:05:29 --> 00:15:07:06
and also

237
00:15:09:20 --> 00:15:12:13
In our territory it is sometimes necessary to go there

238
00:15:13:14 --> 00:15:16:18
to study, or for a god job

239
00:15:17:13 --> 00:15:20:25
and in this way to look for opportunities outside

240
00:15:21:13 --> 00:15:24:00
we make it cause that damage

241
00:15:24:01 --> 00:15:27:04
I told you about earlier, of losing something

242
00:15:27:05 --> 00:15:28:06
from ourselves

243
00:15:28:14 --> 00:15:31:14
So there are many reasons

244
00:15:31:15 --> 00:15:33:12
for that loss. Also,

245
00:15:33:12 --> 00:15:38:05
Also, the Wayuu society itself has lost certain values.

246
00:15:38:21 --> 00:15:44:02
we have let ourselves be carried away by a thought
that is not like us

247
00:15:44:03 --> 00:15:48:27
because our culture is a collective culture
that does everything in collectivism.

248
00:15:49:14 --> 00:15:50:08
Lately

249
00:15:51:15 --> 00:15:52:25
already by

250
00:15:52:26 --> 00:15:57:02
the entries of large multinationals,

251
00:15:57:03 --> 00:16:00:24
has caused the Wayuu to become selfish

252
00:16:01:10 --> 00:16:04:05
and to the point where there is no more unity

253
00:16:04:06 --> 00:16:07:28
and then that
causes conflicts between communities.

254
00:16:08:00 --> 00:16:13:23
The famous conflicts between clans
that among the Wayuu themselves they kill each other, for the sake of a good

255
00:16:14:12 --> 00:16:18:08
or for the benefits that this can generate.

256
00:16:18:27 --> 00:16:24:11
And while that is happening

257
00:16:24:27 --> 00:16:27:01
the way of teaching is also changing.

258
00:16:27:17 --> 00:16:32:09
It is no longer taught that you should love your neighbor
how it used to be taught,

259
00:16:32:20 --> 00:16:36:02
that you must have empathy first and foremost,
This is no longer taught.

260
00:16:36:09 --> 00:16:38:12
So the new generations are being born

261
00:16:39:01 --> 00:16:43:04
without having those values that were and had

262
00:16:43:05 --> 00:16:47:16
our culture,
then the way of thinking is selfishness,

263
00:16:47:22 --> 00:16:50:21
already everyone only assures

264
00:16:52:03 --> 00:16:52:14
what it is

265
00:16:52:14 --> 00:16:55:01
own, what is yours and what you do not share with others.

266
00:16:55:15 --> 00:16:57:21
there is no longer any empathy

267
00:16:58:09 --> 00:17:02:23
And that also generates that among the Wayuu themselves, the same culture

268
00:17:07:16 --> 00:17:09:01
be generated

269
00:17:09:04 --> 00:17:11:27
that we also lose part of our identity,

270
00:17:13:10 --> 00:17:16:08
because already at this moment,

271
00:17:16:09 --> 00:17:21:07
The grandparents who sat in front of a bonfire to teach us, to tell us stories

272
00:17:21:27 --> 00:17:24:27
That used to generate reflection is no longer being done

273
00:17:26:09 --> 00:17:30:01
and then there is no way to recover those values

274
00:17:30:12 --> 00:17:34:10
Or a way of saying, 'Look, we are Wayuu, there is

275
00:17:34:11 --> 00:17:38:22
no need to kill each other

276
00:17:39:08 --> 00:17:43:04
We want to do the work that the old man did,
our ancestors,

277
00:17:43:05 --> 00:17:46:06
our grandfather, in front of a campfire,

278
00:17:46:07 --> 00:17:48:21
teaching the little boys, the young men

279
00:17:50:02 --> 00:17:54:14
So that they always maintain that unity,
that love, that empathy.

280
00:17:54:15 --> 00:17:58:23
We want to do that
through audiovisual creation,

281
00:17:59:10 --> 00:18:04:02
through the short film, our short film,
that space to generate a reflection

282
00:18:05:02 --> 00:18:07:12
both the Wayuu person

283
00:18:08:00 --> 00:18:11:06
as the outsider, the foreigner.

284
00:18:11:07 --> 00:18:13:08
And I have had the opportunity to

285
00:18:13:21 --> 00:18:16:10
to learn a little and I have come

286
00:18:16:11 --> 00:18:18:25
doing interesting things.

287
00:18:21:00 --> 00:18:22:16
And it is the same thing that happens

288
00:18:22:16 --> 00:18:27:12
with writing,
with what I have been writing, it is

289
00:18:27:13 --> 00:18:31:26
a way to grasp this oral knowledge
and systematize it

290
00:18:32:26 --> 00:18:36:20
Take it to a book,
because one of the advantages of an oral tradition

291
00:18:36:21 --> 00:18:41:04
is that over time it gets lost or changed or then
is no longer there.

292
00:18:41:27 --> 00:18:44:04
And so let's say that in those two points

293
00:18:44:05 --> 00:18:46:19
I have concentrated more on contributing

294
00:18:48:23 --> 00:18:54:04
to this Colombian identity.

295
00:18:54:05 --> 00:18:57:21
You can quickly describe where we are now,

296
00:18:57:22 --> 00:19:01:21
as in the urban house.
and the one in front of the ranchería.

297
00:19:02:01 --> 00:19:04:13
So where we are, it's going to be a little bit different.

298
00:19:07:00 --> 00:19:11:17
and reflect the difference between the two.

299
00:19:12:23 --> 00:19:16:26
Well, in Manaure one calls it an urban zone,

300
00:19:17:26 --> 00:19:21:21
practically all over La Guajira

301
00:19:21:23 --> 00:19:25:12
One calls it an urban area,
but it is really not so much urban as semi-urban.

302
00:19:26:29 --> 00:19:30:23
In this case, this house of ours
is in a village,

303
00:19:33:03 --> 00:19:34:11
in the village

304
00:19:34:12 --> 00:19:38:02
as we use the term to refer to it, but

305
00:19:40:16 --> 00:19:42:21
we have maintained

306
00:19:45:14 --> 00:19:48:13
our ways of making traditional houses

307
00:19:48:27 --> 00:19:52:22
and for this space that is here
although it is in the urban zone, we call it an urban zone,

308
00:19:53:00 --> 00:19:56:00
but really the house, the roof, everything

309
00:19:56:01 --> 00:19:59:17
it's like something traditional still

310
00:19:59:23 --> 00:20:01:23
and therefore the differences,

311
00:20:01:24 --> 00:20:07:16
The difference is that in rural areas, there is no electricity, no power, no internet.

312
00:20:08:12 --> 00:20:12:22
and that would be the only difference.

313
00:20:13:18 --> 00:20:16:06
Well, that way there is also much less noise.

314
00:20:16:18 --> 00:20:20:02
Yes, there are also advantages

315
00:20:20:11 --> 00:20:23:07
nature is more

316
00:20:24:08 --> 00:20:24:29
present in

317
00:20:24:29 --> 00:20:28:03
rural areas than in urban areas.

318
00:20:28:22 --> 00:20:31:00
Can you describe who xxx is and

319
00:20:31:18 --> 00:20:34:25
What does it mean to you, to the Wayuu people?

320
00:20:36:05 --> 00:20:40:07
xxx the word for xxx in spanish is madre tierra

321
00:20:41:11 --> 00:20:43:29
or xxx can also mean only

322
00:20:44:00 --> 00:20:47:22
a grain of sand,

323
00:20:48:27 --> 00:20:52:23
but it can also mean
or it can also be assimilated

324
00:20:54:01 --> 00:20:56:04
to say planet,

325
00:20:56:17 --> 00:21:00:13
because the name of this planet, planet Earth,

326
00:21:00:29 --> 00:21:03:23
is related to this concept.

327
00:21:04:10 --> 00:21:07:14
So when we say xxx
We are not only referring to Mother Earth,

328
00:21:07:15 --> 00:21:10:14
but also to the planet itself.

329
00:21:10:15 --> 00:21:14:24
Then that
is the meaning of the word xxx

330
00:21:15:27 --> 00:21:18:08
and for us that is xxx, well xxx

331
00:21:18:09 --> 00:21:21:11
is the mother of us.

332
00:21:21:12 --> 00:21:24:12
It has already been explained to them

333
00:21:25:07 --> 00:21:30:02
that we, for us
our origin is in different generations.

334
00:21:30:03 --> 00:21:32:07
First, they create

335
00:21:32:18 --> 00:21:34:27
or first, life arises

336
00:21:34:28 --> 00:21:38:24
from light

337
00:21:39:26 --> 00:21:42:07
that is born of the night, the darkness.

338
00:21:43:13 --> 00:21:44:13
From that it is born.

339
00:21:44:13 --> 00:21:46:16
Then comes a generation, which is the generation

340
00:21:48:01 --> 00:21:50:18
of the elements

341
00:21:51:23 --> 00:21:56:28
and then the sacred places, then xxx

342
00:21:58:01 --> 00:22:01:02
meet xxx

343
00:22:01:03 --> 00:22:07:17
Being rain, among them
there is a love affair and the fruit of that love affair are the plants,

344
00:22:07:18 --> 00:22:09:22
large plants

345
00:22:09:23 --> 00:22:12:12
and birds.

346
00:22:12:13 --> 00:22:13:26
But mother, xxx,

347
00:22:13:27 --> 00:22:17:04
felt sad because the plants were

348
00:22:17:09 --> 00:22:20:13
immobile.

349
00:22:20:14 --> 00:22:23:23
I wanted children who were independent,
they thought,

350
00:22:24:18 --> 00:22:25:12
And then

351
00:22:27:06 --> 00:22:28:26
had children.

352
00:22:28:27 --> 00:22:30:12
And that's where we went out. The

353
00:22:30:13 --> 00:22:32:15
human beings, the Wayuu.

354
00:22:32:16 --> 00:22:36:12
And so for our worldview, Mma is
our mother,

355
00:22:36:28 --> 00:22:41:04
the one that connects us, the one that has given us

356
00:22:41:26 --> 00:22:44:25
practically everything, because if

357
00:22:44:26 --> 00:22:48:18
we ask ourselves where the things I have come from
or the things I consume

358
00:22:49:09 --> 00:22:52:27
come from mother earth.
