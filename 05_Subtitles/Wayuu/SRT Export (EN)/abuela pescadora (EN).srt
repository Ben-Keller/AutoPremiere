1
00:10 --> 00:13
I'm going to ask you some questions so you can answer us.

2
00:14 --> 00:17
First, can you tell us where we are now?

3
00:18 --> 00:26
What is your name? And what is eirüku (family lineage) from here?

4
00:27 --> 00:32
That is, the one of you who live here,

5
00:33 --> 00:39
That you tell me the lineage of all those who live in this
community if they are Epinayú or other

6
00:41 --> 00:44
It is not necessary that you tell me all but only yours

7
00:50 --> 00:52
Ready? Yes, they are already recording

8
00:53 --> 00:59
Here we are from various lineages, there are the Epieyú and
are the Uriana

9
01:00 --> 01:05
Here there are also Pushainas like my partner

10
01:06 --> 01:07
This is how we are constituted

11
01:09 --> 01:11
my family is Uriana

12
01:12 --> 01:19
I can't tell you that we are all Pushaina or Epieyú
because various lineages within the community

13
01:25 --> 01:33
For example, there are Uriana children, our grandchildren are Epieyú
because we are already mixed

14
01:35 --> 01:38
This is how our last names work as you tell them

15
01:41 --> 01:42
What is the name of the community?

16
01:43 --> 01:44
Neima

17
01:48 --> 01:51
You haven't told us your name, could you tell us

18
01:53 --> 01:55
Do I have to tell you my name?

19
01:58 --> 01:59
Yes of course

20
02:00 --> 02:04
My name is Torira. OK thanks

21
02:09 --> 02:16
Be careful, you're going to knock down the enramada (traditional wayuu building)

22
02:19 --> 02:21
Ok now what's next

23
02:23 --> 02:28
You can explain the environment that there is like the sea, the moon

24
02:29 --> 02:31
That is in its territory here

25
02:32 --> 02:34
How is your territory constituted?

26
02:36 --> 02:40
Can you tell us about what the territory is like?

27
02:41 --> 02:49
For example, you have the sea, you have a canal

28
02:50 --> 02:53
That is, everything related to its territory

29
02:54 --> 03:00
Because we know that some live in the midst of
cardon cactus and there are none here

30
03:01 --> 03:03
Can you say how the territory is constituted?

31
03:04 --> 03:07
Over there is another context, we have the sea here, for example

32
03:09 --> 03:11
Over there it is also pure sea

33
03:14 --> 03:17
On the other hand, over there it is a mountain, because it is already another area

34
03:20 --> 03:25
Only this small area in front has bushes.

35
03:37 --> 03:44
What stories or stories do you know about the sea?

36
03:45 --> 03:51
Tell us what you know or have heard about the sea

37
03:52 --> 03:57
One of the things I've heard the most is that before and now
They don't want us to live here

38
03:58 --> 04:03
By the municipal officials

39
04:04 --> 04:11
As I told you last time, that has only generated unemployment

40
04:17 --> 04:25
Because it is something that was not organized from the beginning

41
04:26 --> 04:31
For example, there they tried to build a bridge, but it was left unfinished

42
04:32 --> 04:37
As well as the roads that began to be built but were also abandoned

43
04:38 --> 04:45
So, attempts have been made to build the roadways, but there are
disputes about it

44
04:47 --> 04:48
That’s how it has been

45
04:53 --> 04:58
Because they already know you and you have come here before

46
04:59 --> 05:07
That's why they didn't give you a problem when entering and
record here

47
05:08 --> 05:13
Because in these lands there is no planting or
alleys or anything

48
05:15 --> 05:19
I would not have received you if you were someone else

49
05:21 --> 05:27
But then I said, it's true he only came to
know what we are

50
05:28 --> 05:35
Thank you very much grandmother for letting us record

51
05:36 --> 05:44
If everything goes well with God's help more
later we will come with a bigger team

52
05:45 --> 05:50
Those who work with films because
they are just students

53
05:51 --> 05:57
But if everything goes well, we can come to
work and believe me I will take them into account

54
05:59 --> 06:03
I will come whenever I can to visit them

55
06:04 --> 06:09
So I thank you for allowing us to record and being here today.

56
06:11 --> 06:20
Well, the last thing to complement the image of the territory,
lately there are some divisions marked by politics

57
06:22 --> 06:24
local government

58
06:26 --> 06:31
Has moved or has modified the territory somehow

59
06:32 --> 06:37
There is the lagoon where we come from,
they have put a bridge at the entrance

60
06:38 --> 06:41
She commented that this was very beautiful before, there was a lot of freedom

61
06:41 --> 06:44
The sea entered there and surrounded you

62
07:06 --> 07:15
You know that those who live near or in the
sea shore they call them Apaalanchi (caribbeans)

63
07:16 --> 07:20
Instead, we who live in the north

64
07:22 --> 07:29
We live by grazing animals such as goats or sheep.

65
07:30 --> 07:33
You don't, you live from fishing for that

66
07:34 --> 07:39
The question is, what is life like for a Caribbean?

67
07:42 --> 07:50
We Caribbeans clearly live from fishing, some of
they practice swimming if they want

68
07:51 --> 07:52
that's how it was before

69
07:53 --> 07:57
Before, people did not use swimming goggles

70
07:58 --> 08:02
They didn't use that, they just went into the water without any of that

71
08:03 --> 08:11
We used to swim, play and have fun in the
sea when we were children

72
08:12 --> 08:19
What we cannot do is to drink sea water,
because one used to fetch water on a donkey from the jagüey (lagoon)

73
08:20 --> 08:27
because it would be a lie if I tell you that we drink potable water through pipelines, we drink dirty water

74
08:28 --> 08:36
And we also cook with it, that's why we appreciate every
drop of water it doesn't matter if it's dirty

75
08:37 --> 08:44
That's right, that's why water is so scarce and valuable.
It's true

76
08:46 --> 08:55
Since I am Wayuu, I also know and I know that what you
consume is what you take from the sea

77
08:56 --> 09:02
Those who record don't know that, could you tell them?
About what they eat and so on

78
09:03 --> 09:07
You say it so that it is recorded on the camera

79
09:09 --> 09:16
The animals of my ancestors grazed on
areas where there were grasses and bushes

80
09:17 --> 09:25
On the other hand, since there’s only breeze in these times, the
animals have starved to death due to lack of grass

81
09:26 --> 09:31
And to give the animals drink, they were taken to
where there was water in lakes

82
09:32 --> 09:38
It was strange if they did not drink in a day, otherwise, there was enough to quench their thirst

83
09:39 --> 09:43
The environment aided grazing before

84
09:44 --> 09:46
Sure, when we had the animals before

85
09:48 --> 09:53
That was also the life of the fishermen, they used to
fish a lot

86
09:54 --> 09:57
And with that we ate a lot

87
09:59 --> 10:03
Before we didn't eat rice, it would be a lie if I said yes

88
10:04 --> 10:09
Before we ate fruits like iguaraya, pitahaya, tunas

89
10:10 --> 10:12
We drank chicha from the fruits of the mokochira (guamacho, local plant)

90
10:13 --> 10:16
In short, we ate the fruits of the plants
thanks to the rain

91
10:18 --> 10:22
We ate honey, black plums and so on.

92
10:28 --> 10:33
Well, and as for the fishermen when they go to sea

93
10:34 --> 10:41
They know the days when they can fish, of course they do,
could you tell us about it

94
10:41 --> 10:45
They know the days and the place where they can fish each time

95
10:46 --> 10:53
It's the little I know because I'm not a fisherman who
they know it's them, like my partner

96
10:54 --> 10:55
Well yes

97
11:00 --> 11:06
They are also guided by a star at night according to
what they say

98
11:10 --> 11:11
so they say

99
11:12 --> 11:16
Well, that last talk about the language of the sea

100
11:17 --> 11:22
The uncle is the one who has gotten into and known the sea the most,
unfortunately the water is not helping

101
11:24 --> 11:30
And well, she talked about how they know that language

102
11:31 --> 11:38
if it’s calmed, I think we should do
an interview with him, it's very good to know that

103
11:56 --> 12:01
It is very good that you ask him the question of what is the
different between a caribbean and a sabanero (from the savannah)?

104
12:03 --> 12:11
Grandma, how is an Apaalanchi (Caribbean) different from
of one that is not?

105
12:12 --> 12:16
Practically, that they’re “the rich”. They live in a different way from the fisherman

106
12:17 --> 12:22
It is different because the rich, as we say, are separated

107
12:23 --> 12:24
Instead, the Apaalanchi is here like everyone

108
12:30 --> 12:35
The man from the savannah has its animals in its own territory

109
12:37 --> 12:39
Yes, thank you very much

110
12:41 --> 12:44
However, that does not change anything in the traditions

111
12:45 --> 12:46
No, it’s the same

112
12:48 --> 12:54
It is the same in everything, just as when “la dote” (a ritual during marriage) is requested for
a woman is the same way nothing changes

113
12:56 --> 12:59
If your old people have told you something

114
13:00 --> 12:08
Surely they have told you that these necklaces were accepted
as surrender for bloodshed

115
13:09 --> 13:13
Threads were accepted inside a totuma (traditional container) to
compensate the damage caused

116
13:14 --> 13:18
By a person where compensation is required
for physical damage

117
13:19 --> 13:22
Today that is no longer accepted

118
13:23 --> 13:29
They want it in money, animals and jewelry. That's how it works
now then it has partly changed

119
13:30 --> 13:37
Before, it was easier to resolve a conflict than now

120
13:38 --> 13:47
They helped each other to reward the damage, some gave
even chickens for support

121
13:49 --> 13:50
that's how it was before

122
13:52 --> 13:57
Or also when a person comes to visit

123
13:58 --> 14:00
They used to them something like meat

124
14:01 --> 14:06
Yes, now they bring rice, corn and sugar if you can
I work there

125
14:08 --> 14:15
And we feed on it, there are times when they bring the animal
alive if you wish to bring it yes

126
14:16 --> 14:21
"So that they eat the guts" will say the one who brought it,
this is our way of living

127
14:23 --> 14:30
It is the same with the fishermen who visit us
they bring a lot of fish

128
14:32 --> 14:39
That's why he is given something for what he brings too

129
14:40 --> 14:43
Yes, as a gift exchange

130
14:44 --> 14:46
This is how friendships worked before

131
15:04 --> 15:09
And what is her role here in her community and in her family?

132
15:15 --> 15:17
ok another question

133
15:19 --> 15:26
We already know what a Caribbean person does, such as fishing.

134
15:27 --> 15:30
What do the Apaalanchi women do in this case?

135
15:31 --> 15:37
She is dedicated to household chores such as looking for firewood to cook

136
15:38 --> 15:45
There are some who dedicate to the art of weaving after
their chores

137
15:46 --> 15:49
When resting or after looking for firewood

138
15:50 --> 15:55
But, there are some women who no longer want to work on that

139
15:56 --> 16:02
Women in the past were more engaged in weaving as
to make chinchorros (hammocks) and others

140
16:03 --> 16:06
For example, I still make chinchorros

141
16:08 --> 16:11
It's in there, if you want, record it too

142
16:12 --> 16:17
Yes of course, now it is recorded for others to see

143
16:18 --> 16:25
We who do not know what the life of the
Apaalanchi we do not know if women also fish

144
16:26 --> 16:31
But you just told us that women
They stay at home and take care of the children.

145
16:32 --> 16:37
Yes, but sometimes I go with those who fish
to be able to feed us

146
16:38 --> 16:44
We help by cleaning and collecting the fish that they manage to catch

147
16:45 --> 16:52
And before they fished for turtles, they would go away at night and bring it back.

148
16:53 --> 17:01
So, we looked for the little ones to prepare it.
and so eat it

149
17:02 --> 17:07
the big ones sold them. Now they sell them at high prices
because they are already scarce

150
17:08 --> 17:11
Just as food has risen in price too

151
17:12 --> 17:13
Yes that's how it is

152
17:28 --> 17:32
Can you say something about

153
17:33 --> 17:39
you know that there are fishing seasons according to the fishermen

154
17:40 --> 17:45
There are days when there is very windy. How do you know
What are those days?

155
17:46 --> 17:51
When they see the algae floating, they already know that the fish
they are not that deep

156
17:52 --> 17:59
Because that is what the fish feed on and they are easier to fish

157
18:00 --> 18:09
But, when almost nothing is caught, it is because they do not have
The fish are hungry according to the fishermen

158
18:15 --> 18:22
What changes have you seen in your eyesight in nature, with
with respect to the sea or the lagoon

159
18:24 --> 18:27
one more question

160
18:29 --> 18:36
How was the ease when fishing before?

161
18:38 --> 18:43
When you were little, was there an abundance of fish?
or is it the same as now?

162
18:44 --> 18:49
It's almost the same as now, well yes

163
18:50 --> 18:56
Well I have also heard a tale from the old

164
18:57 --> 18:03
They said that before the sea had many fish and now
there is almost no more

165
20:12 --> 20:16
Yes, they fish, but they are very small.

166
21:18 --> 21:26
And the spirituality of your way of living with the sea, what is it?

167
21:28 --> 21:36
Grandma, you know that everything has a
spiritual connotation

168
21:37 --> 21:46
There is a spirituality behind, for example, when hunting
much to the rabbit nature manifests itself

169
21:47 --> 21:49
What is the spiritual connotation that the sea has?

170
21:50 --> 21:57
The sea feeds on people too, several have already died
people in the

171
21:59 --> 22:07
There is a supernatural being in the sea that feeds people,
we say Pulowi, maybe the arijunas (not indigenous people) call it different

172
22:08 --> 22:10
For us it is a supernatural being

173
22:11 --> 22:17
Who feeds on people, makes them seriously ill until they die

174
22:18 --> 22:21
This is how delicate is the spiritual connotation of the sea

175
22:22 --> 22:25
Have you dreamed or have you seen this phenomenon?

176
22:26 --> 22:33
If I have dreamed about it, I see it in my dreams with a giant tail

177
22:34 --> 22:39
And there are many types of phenomena that appear at night

178
22:44 --> 22:51
They would appear there when that little house was not there,
there was only us

179
22:52 --> 22:59
There was no one like now, there was only us
for years

180
23:00 --> 23:05
There was only one of my daughters from the beginning, with her husband
who worked with shrimp

181
23:07 --> 23:14
Until I told my husband to stay here
because we worked with shrimp

182
23:15 --> 23:22
We can't be suffering at midnight, I told my old man

183
23:23 --> 23:30
I fished at midnight with my old man and I ended up sleepy,
I even fell asleep on the way

184
23:31 --> 23:36
I would get up when I bumped into something on the
road to the sea

185
23:37 --> 23:43
And since then, we stayed living here
to avoid suffering too much, and here we are

186
23:44 --> 23:51
Yes, it is true, when we want to live well it is necessary to move

187
23:52 --> 23:56
For example, my father was from the savannah

188
23:57 --> 24:01
And he came to work with salt, since then he has
grown old here

189
24:02 --> 24:05
And looking for a better quality of life

190
24:06 --> 24:11
Yes, of course, he wanted to try his luck elsewhere and it went well.

191
24:14 --> 24:16
that's how we did

192
24:18 --> 24:25
They may even have animals, but no one (wants to)put them down
in the midst of so many needs

193
24:26 --> 24:32
Even so, they sacrifice them to sell them and
be able to buy food

194
24:33 --> 24:35
It is the same with fishing because we eat through it.

195
24:36 --> 24:40
That was before when everyone had their animals

196
24:41 --> 24:43
That's right, your words are very consistent

197
24:46 --> 24:47
She responded very accurately to tell the truth.

198
25:03 --> 25:06
I don't know if you have a message you want to give to the world

199
25:11 --> 25:14
Well grandma, to finish now

200
25:16 --> 25:23
The good thing about these cameras is that whatever you say
will be recorded

201
25:24 --> 25:28
When they finish, it is shown to them so that you can see it yourself.

202
25:29 --> 25:35
So, what you say will be recorded so the children
of now and those of the future generation see it

203
25:37 --> 25:45
what I want to say with this is that you give a message
for you to see and hear later

204
25:46 --> 25:50
Yes, it would be like talking to them in the future

205
26:03 --> 26:08
Can you tell us what those words would be for the children?

206
26:09 --> 26:14
You can say, for example, that they value culture and
don't be ashamed of it, as well as some advice

207
26:17 --> 26:19
for the new generation

208
26:19 --> 26:20
Of course I'm going to tell you

209
26:22 --> 26:28
Yes, but, you can say it here so that it is recorded

210
26:29 --> 26:33
Kids these days are a bit rebellious

211
26:34 --> 26:42
But it is up to them to remember and maintain what we are,
remember their grandparents

212
26:43 --> 26:46
Remember their grandmothers and think about what we do for them now

213
26:47 --> 26:52
It is up to them to remember our words when they are adults

214
26:53 --> 26:59
They are the ones who should reflect on the future if
they want to do it for us

215
27:00 --> 27:07
These here are my grandchildren, I have other young grandchildren
but they are in Manaure

216
27:08 --> 27:11
There they are so they can study

217
27:12 --> 27:14
I'm the only one that stays here

218
27:15 --> 27:16
It is true what you say

219
27:18 --> 27:24
The message is also for you, you must remember our culture

220
27:25 --> 27:32
how you came to me, you must remember me later and visit me from time to time

221
27:33 --> 27:40
Bring me coffee, or whatever the arijunas send to whom
the breeze moves their hair for being here

222
27:41 --> 27:46
That in fact I am glad that they see that my
Enramada (traditional wayuu building) is made of rag

223
27:51 --> 27:57
And sadly I don't have chicha now to
show you and explain you that that's our drink

224
27:58 --> 28:00
Made from corn

225
28:03 --> 28:06
But there is no water son, there is a lot of drought

226
28:08 --> 28:11
We suffer a lot from the lack of drinking water

227
28:12 --> 28:13
that's how it is everywhere

228
28:14 --> 28:16
Not even in town they have water, over here we have even less

229
28:20 --> 28:28
Yes it's true, my children who are in town sometimes
have to ask their neighbors for water in a jar

230
28:29 --> 28:32
So what you say is very true, that's everywhere

231
28:33 --> 28:38
That is why it is good to record the true reality of
you because that

232
28:39 --> 28:45
That puts in trouble those who work in the mayor's office

233
28:46 --> 28:49
Because they say in front of others that you don't
have needs

234
28:50 --> 28:51
That is true

235
28:52 --> 28:58
That's why it's good to record your words because when
it is made public they scold the municipal administration

236
28:59 --> 29:07
And they track them, so we have to show how
we live without shame

237
29:08 --> 29:10
and without fear

238
29:12 --> 29:14
So thank you grandma

239
29:15 --> 29:22
And believe me that I will return with Fray because we will not
we will forget about you

240
29:23 --> 29:30
We will keep them in mind, in fact, what we record at the same time
past we are still working on it

241
29:31 --> 29:32
we are still editing

242
29:33 --> 29:37
So thank you very much for sharing with the arijunas

243
29:39 --> 29:47
And for saying it in front of the cameras. Now let's
do another interview.
