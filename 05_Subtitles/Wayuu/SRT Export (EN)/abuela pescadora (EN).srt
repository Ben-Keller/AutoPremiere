1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm going to ask you some questions so you can answer us.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
First, can you tell us where we are now?

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What is your name? And what is eirüku (family lineage) from here?

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That is, the one of you who live here,

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That you tell me the lineage of all those who live in this
community if they are Epinayú or other

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is not necessary that you tell me all but only yours

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Ready? Yes, they are already recording

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Here we are from various lineages, there are the Epieyú and
are the Uriana

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Here there are also Pushainas like my partner

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This is how we are constituted

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
my family is Uriana

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I can't tell you that we are all Pushaina or Epieyú
because various lineages within the community

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
For example, there are Uriana children, our grandchildren are Epieyú
because we are already mixed

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This is how our last names work as you tell them

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What is the name of the community?

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Neima

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You haven't told us your name, could you tell us

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Do I have to tell you my name?

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes of course

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
My name is Torira. OK thanks

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Be careful, you're going to knock down the enramada (traditional wayuu building)

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Ok now what's next

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You can explain the environment that there is like the sea, the moon

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That is in its territory here

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
How is your territory constituted?

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Can you tell us about what the territory is like?

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
For example, you have the sea, you have a canal

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That is, everything related to its territory

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Because we know that some live in the midst of
cardon cactus and there are none here

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Can you say how the territory is constituted?

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Over there is another context, we have the sea here, for example

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Over there it is also pure sea

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
On the other hand, over there it is a mountain, because it is already another area

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Only this small area in front has bushes.

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What stories or stories do you know about the sea?

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Tell us what you know or have heard about the sea

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
One of the things I've heard the most is that before and now
They don't want us to live here

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
By the municipal officials

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
As I told you last time, that has only generated unemployment

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Because it is something that was not organized from the beginning

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
For example, there they tried to build a bridge, but it was left unfinished

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
As well as the roads that began to be built but were also abandoned

43
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So, attempts have been made to build the roadways, but there are
disputes about it

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That’s how it has been

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Because they already know you and you have come here before

46
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's why they didn't give you a problem when entering and
record here

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Because in these lands there is no planting or
alleys or anything

48
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I would not have received you if you were someone else

49
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But then I said, it's true he only came to
know what we are

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Thank you very much grandmother for letting us record

51
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If everything goes well with God's help more
later we will come with a bigger team

52
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Those who work with films because
they are just students

53
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But if everything goes well, we can come to
work and believe me I will take them into account

54
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I will come whenever I can to visit them

55
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So I thank you for allowing us to record and being here today.

56
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Well, the last thing to complement the image of the territory,
lately there are some divisions marked by politics

57
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
local government

58
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Has moved or has modified the territory somehow

59
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
There is the lagoon where we come from,
they have put a bridge at the entrance

60
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
She commented that this was very beautiful before, there was a lot of freedom

61
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The sea entered there and surrounded you

62
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You know that those who live near or in the
sea shore they call them Apaalanchi (caribbeans)

63
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Instead, we who live in the north

64
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We live by grazing animals such as goats or sheep.

65
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You don't, you live from fishing for that

66
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The question is, what is life like for a Caribbean?

67
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We Caribbeans clearly live from fishing, some of
they practice swimming if they want

68
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
that's how it was before

69
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Before, people did not use swimming goggles

70
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
They didn't use that, they just went into the water without any of that

71
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We used to swim, play and have fun in the
sea when we were children

72
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What we cannot do is to drink sea water,
because one used to fetch water on a donkey from the jagüey (lagoon)

73
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
because it would be a lie if I tell you that we drink potable water through pipelines, we drink dirty water

74
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And we also cook with it, that's why we appreciate every
drop of water it doesn't matter if it's dirty

75
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's right, that's why water is so scarce and valuable.
It's true

76
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Since I am Wayuu, I also know and I know that what you
consume is what you take from the sea

77
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Those who record don't know that, could you tell them?
About what they eat and so on

78
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You say it so that it is recorded on the camera

79
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The animals of my ancestors grazed on
areas where there were grasses and bushes

80
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,000
On the other hand, since there’s only breeze in these times, the
animals have starved to death due to lack of grass

81
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And to give the animals drink, they were taken to
where there was water in lakes

82
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It was strange if they did not drink in a day, otherwise, there was enough to quench their thirst

83
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The environment aided grazing before

84
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Sure, when we had the animals before

85
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That was also the life of the fishermen, they used to
fish a lot

86
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And with that we ate a lot

87
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Before we didn't eat rice, it would be a lie if I said yes

88
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Before we ate fruits like iguaraya, pitahaya, tunas

89
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We drank chicha from the fruits of the mokochira (guamacho, local plant)

90
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
In short, we ate the fruits of the plants
thanks to the rain

91
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
We ate honey, black plums and so on.

92
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, and as for the fishermen when they go to sea

93
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
They know the days when they can fish, of course they do,
could you tell us about it

94
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
They know the days and the place where they can fish each time

95
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's the little I know because I'm not a fisherman who
they know it's them, like my partner

96
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Well yes

97
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
They are also guided by a star at night according to
what they say

98
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
so they say

99
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Well, that last talk about the language of the sea

100
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The uncle is the one who has gotten into and known the sea the most,
unfortunately the water is not helping

101
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And well, she talked about how they know that language

102
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
if it’s calmed, I think we should do
an interview with him, it's very good to know that

103
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It is very good that you ask him the question of what is the
different between a caribbean and a sabanero (from the savannah)?

104
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Grandma, how is an Apaalanchi (Caribbean) different from
of one that is not?

105
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Practically, that they’re “the rich”. They live in a different way from the fisherman

106
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It is different because the rich, as we say, are separated

107
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Instead, the Apaalanchi is here like everyone

108
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The man from the savannah has its animals in its own territory

109
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes, thank you very much

110
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
However, that does not change anything in the traditions

111
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
No, it’s the same

112
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It is the same in everything, just as when “la dote” (a ritual during marriage) is requested for
a woman is the same way nothing changes

113
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
If your old people have told you something

114
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Surely they have told you that these necklaces were accepted
as surrender for bloodshed

115
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Threads were accepted inside a totuma (traditional container) to
compensate the damage caused

116
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
By a person where compensation is required
for physical damage

117
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Today that is no longer accepted

118
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
They want it in money, animals and jewelry. That's how it works
now then it has partly changed

119
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Before, it was easier to resolve a conflict than now

120
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:47,000
They helped each other to reward the damage, some gave
even chickens for support

121
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
that's how it was before

122
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Or also when a person comes to visit

123
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
They used to them something like meat

124
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yes, now they bring rice, corn and sugar if you can
I work there

125
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And we feed on it, there are times when they bring the animal
alive if you wish to bring it yes

126
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
"So that they eat the guts" will say the one who brought it,
this is our way of living

127
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It is the same with the fishermen who visit us
they bring a lot of fish

128
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That's why he is given something for what he brings too

129
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes, as a gift exchange

130
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
This is how friendships worked before

131
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And what is her role here in her community and in her family?

132
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
ok another question

133
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
We already know what a Caribbean person does, such as fishing.

134
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What do the Apaalanchi women do in this case?

135
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
She is dedicated to household chores such as looking for firewood to cook

136
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
There are some who dedicate to the art of weaving after
their chores

137
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
When resting or after looking for firewood

138
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But, there are some women who no longer want to work on that

139
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Women in the past were more engaged in weaving as
to make chinchorros (hammocks) and others

140
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
For example, I still make chinchorros

141
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's in there, if you want, record it too

142
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yes of course, now it is recorded for others to see

143
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
We who do not know what the life of the
Apaalanchi we do not know if women also fish

144
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But you just told us that women
They stay at home and take care of the children.

145
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yes, but sometimes I go with those who fish
to be able to feed us

146
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
We help by cleaning and collecting the fish that they manage to catch

147
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And before they fished for turtles, they would go away at night and bring it back.

148
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So, we looked for the little ones to prepare it.
and so eat it

149
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
the big ones sold them. Now they sell them at high prices
because they are already scarce

150
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Just as food has risen in price too

151
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes that's how it is

152
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Can you say something about

153
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
you know that there are fishing seasons according to the fishermen

154
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
There are days when there is very windy. How do you know
What are those days?

155
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
When they see the algae floating, they already know that the fish
they are not that deep

156
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Because that is what the fish feed on and they are easier to fish

157
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But, when almost nothing is caught, it is because they do not have
The fish are hungry according to the fishermen

158
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What changes have you seen in your eyesight in nature, with
with respect to the sea or the lagoon

159
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
one more question

160
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
How was the ease when fishing before?

161
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
When you were little, was there an abundance of fish?
or is it the same as now?

162
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's almost the same as now, well yes

163
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Well I have also heard a tale from the old

164
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
They said that before the sea had many fish and now
there is almost no more

165
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yes, they fish, but they are very small.

166
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And the spirituality of your way of living with the sea, what is it?

167
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Grandma, you know that everything has a
spiritual connotation

168
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:46,000
There is a spirituality behind, for example, when hunting
much to the rabbit nature manifests itself

169
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What is the spiritual connotation that the sea has?

170
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The sea feeds on people too, several have already died
people in the

171
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:07,000
There is a supernatural being in the sea that feeds people,
we say Pulowi, maybe the arijunas (not indigenous people) call it different

172
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
For us it is a supernatural being

173
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Who feeds on people, makes them seriously ill until they die

174
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
This is how delicate is the spiritual connotation of the sea

175
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Have you dreamed or have you seen this phenomenon?

176
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,000
If I have dreamed about it, I see it in my dreams with a giant tail

177
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And there are many types of phenomena that appear at night

178
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
They would appear there when that little house was not there,
there was only us

179
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
There was no one like now, there was only us
for years

180
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
There was only one of my daughters from the beginning, with her husband
who worked with shrimp

181
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Until I told my husband to stay here
because we worked with shrimp

182
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
We can't be suffering at midnight, I told my old man

183
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I fished at midnight with my old man and I ended up sleepy,
I even fell asleep on the way

184
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I would get up when I bumped into something on the
road to the sea

185
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And since then, we stayed living here
to avoid suffering too much, and here we are

186
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yes, it is true, when we want to live well it is necessary to move

187
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
For example, my father was from the savannah

188
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And he came to work with salt, since then he has
grown old here

189
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And looking for a better quality of life

190
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Yes, of course, he wanted to try his luck elsewhere and it went well.

191
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
that's how we did

192
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
They may even have animals, but no one (wants to)put them down
in the midst of so many needs

193
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Even so, they sacrifice them to sell them and
be able to buy food

194
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It is the same with fishing because we eat through it.

195
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
That was before when everyone had their animals

196
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
That's right, your words are very consistent

197
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
She responded very accurately to tell the truth.

198
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I don't know if you have a message you want to give to the world

199
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Well grandma, to finish now

200
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
The good thing about these cameras is that whatever you say
will be recorded

201
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
When they finish, it is shown to them so that you can see it yourself.

202
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So, what you say will be recorded so the children
of now and those of the future generation see it

203
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:45,000
what I want to say with this is that you give a message
for you to see and hear later

204
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yes, it would be like talking to them in the future

205
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Can you tell us what those words would be for the children?

206
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You can say, for example, that they value culture and
don't be ashamed of it, as well as some advice

207
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
for the new generation

208
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Of course I'm going to tell you

209
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Yes, but, you can say it here so that it is recorded

210
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Kids these days are a bit rebellious

211
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But it is up to them to remember and maintain what we are,
remember their grandparents

212
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Remember their grandmothers and think about what we do for them now

213
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It is up to them to remember our words when they are adults

214
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
They are the ones who should reflect on the future if
they want to do it for us

215
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
These here are my grandchildren, I have other young grandchildren
but they are in Manaure

216
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
There they are so they can study

217
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm the only one that stays here

218
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It is true what you say

219
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
The message is also for you, you must remember our culture

220
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
how you came to me, you must remember me later and visit me from time to time

221
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Bring me coffee, or whatever the arijunas send to whom
the breeze moves their hair for being here

222
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
That in fact I am glad that they see that my
Enramada (traditional wayuu building) is made of rag

223
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And sadly I don't have chicha now to
show you and explain you that that's our drink

224
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Made from corn

225
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
But there is no water son, there is a lot of drought

226
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
We suffer a lot from the lack of drinking water

227
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
that's how it is everywhere

228
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Not even in town they have water, over here we have even less

229
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Yes it's true, my children who are in town sometimes
have to ask their neighbors for water in a jar

230
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
So what you say is very true, that's everywhere

231
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
That is why it is good to record the true reality of
you because that

232
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
That puts in trouble those who work in the mayor's office

233
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Because they say in front of others that you don't
have needs

234
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
That is true

235
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
That's why it's good to record your words because when
it is made public they scold the municipal administration

236
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And they track them, so we have to show how
we live without shame

237
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and without fear

238
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So thank you grandma

239
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And believe me that I will return with Fray because we will not
we will forget about you

240
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,000
We will keep them in mind, in fact, what we record at the same time
past we are still working on it

241
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
we are still editing

242
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So thank you very much for sharing with the arijunas

243
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And for saying it in front of the cameras. Now let's
do another interview.
