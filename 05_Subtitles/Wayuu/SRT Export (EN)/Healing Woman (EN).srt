1
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,416
Can you explain to me, who are you and what do you do?

2
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:32,041
And what ritual are we going to do? anas alika

3
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,583
Good afternoon.

4
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,083
my name is

5
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,500
Teolinda, Wayuu Epiayu

6
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:43,083
My name is Teolinda from the clan of Epinayu

7
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:48,208
I am from the walapuinje ranch which means “dreams and interpretations”,

8
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,250
dreams.

9
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,375
Today I am going to tell you about traditional medicine

10
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,250
that I inherited from my grandmother.

11
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,625
As we know

12
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:04,375
here it is very difficult for one to run towards
a doctor or a health center,

13
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:10,166
so as we are growing up, our grandmothers taught us to purify

14
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,833
and they taught us about traditional medicine,

15
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,250
how we could cure one of our children.

16
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,458
For example, when the child has diarrhea, we can give him

17
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:22,916
jawapi a medicinal plant

18
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:27,750
the jawapi, which is a medicinal plant, helps a lot

19
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:33,166
to clean the child's organism and that diarrhea can stop and can also

20
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:39,166
help to clean as if it were a chamomile, but it is a jawapia, made with medicinal plants

21
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,375
and also when the child has a fever or diarrhea or vomiting

22
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:49,083
We also have this medicine here, we make it,

23
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,666
we take and start right here with the stone

24
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,291
and we put it

25
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,333
in this totumito (container) and we give the baby a drink.

26
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,125
It also helps scare away bad energy.

27
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,125
What plant is it?

28
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,375
This is called kalenasee

29
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,791
Kalenasee is a plant that, just by its

30
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,833
smell, scares away spirits.

31
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,500
Well now in this moment

32
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,125
here is my niece,

33
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,708
She is sick

34
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,666
and I am going to give her medicine that through dreams

35
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:59,208
Grandma interpreted. She showed me one of the plants

36
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,833
Which one is the medicine that I am going to give her,
because she had an accident

37
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:10,625
and the accident had her here in the collarbone
and I have to take the medicine

38
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:15,541
that is called a'tachon,
a´tachon is a medicinal plant medicine,

39
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:21,708
it also helps a lot to clean the blood
and for the person who also suffers from a fracture

40
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:25,125
or a very serious injury.

41
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:29,500
One takes this, attaches it and begins to scratch it

42
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,208
with a stone now

43
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,166
soak it

44
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,125
here with the water

45
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:43,333
Now it looks as if it was water, all fresh,
So I'm going to give her a drink

46
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,041
for that fracture to heal

47
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,875
do I drink it all? yes my lady, drink it all because it will cure you

48
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,125
The other goes here

49
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm going to cure her with a little
what was left to where

50
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:18,333
has been fractured.

51
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,500
and that

52
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,125
is the bija blanca

53
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,208
this is a very important plant

54
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,375
And
to bathe our boys, or girl.

55
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,291
The moment that,

56
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,416
When a girl has fever

57
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,083
and when you can't sleep at night
as one says,

58
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,708
"She is restless", is when the girl, the baby or the girl

59
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,958
does not sleep well, sleep is
like drowsiness.

60
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,375
Then looking at her, we take the bija,

61
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,458
we start cooking it
we are not going to do that anymore, but we are going to cook it

62
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:59,541
or it can also be by pieces
we already have it here.

63
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,500
It can also be accompanied by chirrinchi (alcoholic drink).

64
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,500
you'll be fine, it won't hurt anymore

65
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,333
this disease is leaving you

66
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,375
you will be fine

67
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:44,666
You won't get sick anymore and it won't hurt anymore my girl

68
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,333
that's when the girl, like I was

69
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,500
saying at first that she feels bad,

70
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,708
with flu, wanting to vomit, nauseated.

71
00:10:56,125 --> 00:11:00,166
One cures it with the malua, which is one of the best-known plants.

72
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:04,083
and to scare what she has,
if she is, well

73
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,583
Feeling like apathetic, that she feels

74
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,250
that her body is not hers, that she is gone,

75
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:15,208
then through dreams
we dream and see which plant we can cure it with.

76
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,875
They show themselves to us by dream interpretations.

77
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:23,875
There I saw that in the dream they said that she
they had to scare her away what she has

78
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,041
and try to do a purification

79
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,708
of body through malua

80
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,083
better known as bija.

81
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,333
Is it an energy purification?

82
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,583
Yes, an energy like hers, she is sick

83
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:45,041
to scare away what she had
or the energy that was already bad

84
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:49,291
and suddenly they scare it with something
cold that is the chirrinchi (alcoholic drink) and also with the medicine

85
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,125
she's going to feel good
everything she had wrong

86
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:56,125
She will get her energy back.

87
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,875
Well, in her case, the flu,

88
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,125
we have

89
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,083
We also have the

90
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:09,083
with the

91
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,625
kalenakalu, this one

92
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,500
three together,

93
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,208
these plants heal

94
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,125
the flu disease, of the asthmatic person

95
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:27,125
doing vaporization and by drink

96
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,666
and the vaporization with sea salt.

97
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,041
One of those who fought a lot
With the COVID disease

98
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,291
It was this wonderful (plant) that you see here,

99
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,750
doing the vaporization with the sea salt.

100
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:44,166
All three of them together
Are mixed and you have to drink it

101
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:49,750
before coffee or breakfast
because it is already in the morning.

102
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:54,791
It is the first thing that before drinking coffee, to
drink this for the flu.

103
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:59,333
It heals our children quite a lot,
is the only medicine

104
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:05,166
that we use in our ranch.

105
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,208
when our children

106
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:11,208
or when there is diarrhea

107
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,083
very strong that the diarrhea comes with blood.

108
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,833
This is called turio'u, the turio'u

109
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,000
or itachon (because of its cup shape)

110
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,416
It is when one begins to scratch the itachon,

111
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,250
already scratched,

112
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:36,541
touch,

113
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:41,625
A red, pinkish color comes out, that is the one that will cure

114
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,333
to the person who has diarrhea

115
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,666
it's called wainruin'ou,

116
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:54,666
This wainruin'ou medicine

117
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,875
Do you see the color?

118
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,416
wainruin'ou is for diarrhea.

119
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:09,375
Let's say,

120
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:13,041
Our children drink it and it helps a lot to stop the diarrhea

121
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,083
So the diarrhea no longer continues for the child or the lady.

122
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,791
When diarrhea comes with blood, it is already accompanied

123
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,708
of the turi´ou of the wainruin´ou (plants) with this

124
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,541
which is called palisa or kinou'ta,

125
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,041
that is the red medicine

126
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,458
And they are sticks and this is dry too,

127
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,583
all three are cooked together and you start drinking it

128
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,708
twice a week, Monday and Tuesday,

129
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,458
Then the other week Monday and Tuesday.

130
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:52,500
And so on, until the diarrhea goes away.

131
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,041
Drink it just a little

132
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,708
and it must be very bitter

133
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,916
so it can stop the diarrhea.

134
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,416
On the other hand,

135
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,041
we have here the kasuou

136
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,000
when our children

137
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,625
girls develop at the age of 12,

138
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:21,625
we also have to purify the body with jawapia,
clean the body

139
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,000
In order to have the girl

140
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:29,958
with firm skin forever and that she enjoys
eternal youth,

141
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,583
We give you the mou'a, the mou'a is the dove

142
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,375
and we cook it as if it was soup
and as a traditional drink so that she

143
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:43,208
Can have very clean skin
and to stay well,

144
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:47,291
it is called kasuo´u (white bun), a stone

145
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,708
kasuo´u The drink of the majayut (lady)

146
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:55,625
or the confinement drink or the young lady drink.

147
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,000
well and

148
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,833
one of those is the,

149
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:17,541
the bath to purify the body,
the bath

150
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:22,041
tries that when there is a problem, there are many kinds of problem.

151
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:26,416
For example, it may be the problem of death
or the problem

152
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:32,041
when there is controversy
for example, with the territories,

153
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,083
one has to find a way to take a bath

154
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,791
to scare away that problem, so that it goes away,

155
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:42,500
To avoid a problem between the two families,

156
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,666
that family has to stay united

157
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,625
and for this problem it is necessary to look for the solution.

158
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,083
And then, how do we do it?, with the bath

159
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,166
Basically all medicines are already together

160
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,541
which is the bath

161
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:58,791
That already comes

162
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:02,791
with chirrinchi that's already cold

163
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:07,208
and start to do the bath, scare it from behind

164
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:13,083
so that when it goes, move there, look there

165
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,125
well, with the totuma like this,

166
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,708
one does it like that, scaring

167
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,666
The bad energy

168
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,125
so that this problem does not come back

169
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:30,125
and she has to push it away and let her talk

170
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:35,041
and tell it to go to the bottom of the sea, taking also
of course

171
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:39,375
the lania (amulet or charm), begins…
I'm going to take out the lania.

172
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:44,000
The lania is a tiny backpack

173
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,833
That Lania is Grandma's.

174
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,625
jawapia

175
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,916
This jawapia you have to try to scratch it

176
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,708
to do the girl's bath, to scare the

177
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:32,791
problematic, move away that problem

178
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,791
so that none of the family will be touched,
nor the family

179
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:39,958
of the young

180
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,916
It's called jawapia

181
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,625
a medicinal green plant

182
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:48,583
that has its name,
but it's grandma's secret.

183
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,708
You don't have to say,
but you have to show nothing more than medicine,

184
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,208
because one never reveals
what is something important to her.

185
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,083
You must keep it, you can take it

186
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:04,166
with your own hands,

187
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,583
The plant.

188
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,541
This is the lania

189
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:58,958
of the grandmother

190
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:04,166
You pick it up and starts to

191
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:07,916
take away anything evil there is

192
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,958
take what’s evil to the bottom of the sea, let no evil come near here

193
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:17,250
so that it does not affect our guests. God I ask you

194
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,333
who entrusted me with this plant to protect people.

195
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,916
Scaring away with this, it is the grandmother's lania,

196
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,375
pushing away what comes above,
if it’s a territory problem

197
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:34,291
or death problem,
and one has to find a way to cleanse oneself,

198
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:39,708
to purify oneself and we can also find the stone
with indigenous protection.

199
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,166
And that was also because of grandmother's interpretations

200
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,000
That are these stones

201
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,541
It is called tuma or cornalina

202
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,000
to try to get clean

203
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,541
and protect yourself.

204
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:14,125
As you can see also jawapia is drinkable,

205
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:18,833
It is drinkable so that it stays in one's stomach,

206
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:23,250
whether a person comes to
dare to seek to kill,

207
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:28,625
He comes looking for death, he doesn't,
because it is protected by this jawapia in the stomach.

208
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:33,625
And the same goes with the protections.

209
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,125
Ask, ask.

210
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,833
Where does all knowledge come from?

211
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:48,208
Well, that knowledge comes from the
Grandma, it is ancestral, but as

212
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,500
I tell you at the age of 12 we learn a lot.

213
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,208
That is why one says that education comes from home.

214
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:57,541
What we learn first is from our elders
and traditional medicine

215
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:02,125
we inherited it, it is an inheritance for us,
because when we are in growing up

216
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:05,541
They show us or teach us about
traditional medicine

217
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:09,541
and teach us about values
and that is ancestral

218
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:13,416
How does one choose to be knowledgeable?

219
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:17,125
Well, when Grandma is very old,
For example, 90 years old,

220
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:21,083
she has to search and she won't tell you
You're going to replace me

221
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:26,250
she begins to dream and in her dreams,
she chooses the person who is going to replace her.

222
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:31,166
And that person that she chooses,
she has already analyzed it, and sits it down,

223
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,916
he sits with her,
begins to teach him his gifts, his wisdom,

224
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,250
what does each plant mean,
What is each plant for?

225
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,583
Look at this, you're going to dream

226
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,833
and they will show you through your dreams

227
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:49,083
the medicine you are going to use.

228
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,166
Is it spiritual then?

229
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:56,208
Spiritual yes, Spiritual, of course,
because you know that is also biblical, too

230
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,666
when in the time of Jesus he sends

231
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:01,166
to José, for the dream

232
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:06,083
that he had, that he had
to reveal dreams to the Egyptians

233
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:10,166
of the seven plagues
and they never believed, and from the famine

234
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:13,083
and it really came. once one

235
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:16,166
for dreams, one also has to go through the line of

236
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,833
that and believe,
because the truth is that a dream,

237
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,666
It's not a game, it's a dream.

238
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:26,208
And that dream must be treated if it is bad,
you have to push it away like I was doing to the girl,

239
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:30,916
scare away that dream
that they dreamed for her, take all that away from her.

240
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,708
That's what the dream is about

241
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,791
and it has to do with traditional medicine.

242
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:38,500
And all that?

243
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,375
It's like a story or a

244
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:43,000
knowledge?

245
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:45,500
Knowledge, a knowledge.

246
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:05,083
That's called piachi

247
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:06,000
medical,

248
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:06,250
medical

249
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,916
ancestral, has its piachi name in parentheses

250
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:14,041
(ancestral medicine) and the piache can also help on deliveries

251
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:19,083
when a girl is pregnant
and the child is wrong, because he can

252
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:24,750
one to compose lifting it here from the waist to here
so that baby can be located in its place.

253
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:27,208
Then on the birth day,there will not have difficulty.

254
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:32,250
You can say that word, lapuja.

255
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:34,875
Dreams, lapu'je yes, lapu'je

256
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,625
Sure, as I was saying earlier
That

257
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:41,583
grandma tells which person
she is going to choose, she dreams first, lapu'je

258
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:47,875
Dream.

259
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,666
One more thing, how do plants taste?

260
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,875
Because I have knowledge of those plants, I learned,
It's like the doctor

261
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:06,083
the one who studies to study,
For example, headache.

262
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:10,250
I can grab a chirrinchi
I put it on my head, my headache goes away

263
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:14,375
because I know that it is good for a headache,
for diarrhea that comes with blood

264
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:18,250
I know what it is, it’s this one, I start to scratch it
and I take it

265
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,125
or I give it to drink, because honestly
maybe no medicine can cure it,

266
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:25,208
but suddenly this can cure it
because we have had some cases.

267
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:29,250
A case, an example,
a man who was evicted in a wheelchair,

268
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:32,166
came from Italy, where science is most advanced

269
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,625
and they evicted him in a wheelchair.

270
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:38,000
He came here, here to Manaure to visit, like you

271
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,166
As a tourist and I received it
and I told my grandmother that there is a man

272
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:46,625
who is in a wheelchair,
but he was evicted because he cannot walk for life.

273
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:51,166
My grandmother told me for God nothing is impossible,
maleiwa, for him nothing is impossible.

274
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:54,416
Maleiwa is God and if He shows me in a dream

275
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:57,166
What I can cure this man with, yes it can be cured.

276
00:26:57,458 --> 00:27:00,208
They showed him it was sea salt,
and the salt raised it

277
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:03,166
marine along with a massage

278
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:04,208
nothing more, and with chirrinchi.

279
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,666
And nowadays, this man walks with crutches

280
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:11,000
when science said he’d be on a wheelchair
for the rest of his life,

281
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,166
He was lifted by a Wayuu woman.

282
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:15,583
Faith,

283
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,625
and faith moves mountains.

284
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,125
May I introduce you

285
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:27,166
again, like who are you and what do you do

286
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:29,333
and where are we?

287
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:33,375
Okay, yes. Anas aliika, good afternoon, tanulia

288
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,458
My name is Teolinda from the Epiyu clan.

289
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,041
I am a Wayuu indigenous

290
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,625
one of those who is, one of the knowers, one of the

291
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,375
piachi (medical) obtained by grandmother,

292
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:49,375
since she is very old.

293
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:51,208
She already has her replacement.

294
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,500
Little by little she is leaving her gifts, her wisdom
and that is through lapu'je,

295
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,291
dream interpretations.

296
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:02,083
We are here in the walapuinje ranch, which means dream,

297
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:05,958
anayawatsu

298
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
anayawatsu is thank you.

299
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:11,083
And the last thing is that if you have a message.

300
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:15,166
Well, the message that I am going to give you is that

301
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:17,833
Us, the wayuu, the idea is that this

302
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:23,500
stays with our grandchildren, with our children,
with our grandchildren, not to be missed.

303
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:28,416
We want you to know our
medicine, just as they have their medicine,

304
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:32,666
we also have our traditional medicine
that we got from grandma.

305
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:36,083
Thanks to maleiwa (God),
that is everything, He is who created the plants

306
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:39,541
and we are using all those plants to cure those who are sick.

307
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:43,416
I invite you to come
and can make a good purification

308
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:46,791
here in the walapuinje ranch,

309
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:49,875
If you feel sick, if you feel something, come here

310
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:52,541
I wait for you here, here in the Walapuinje ranch

311
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,458
The knowing woman Teolinda, Thank you..

312
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,166
the way she interprets dreams

313
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:09,500
How do you know?

314
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,791
I dream, I sleep and

315
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:17,208
the next day we sat down with a coffee

316
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,208
Juana bring me coffee please

317
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,583
rinse it first

318
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:25,500
Now I am going to tell you how they interpret the dream.

319
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:28,666
And what does it mean to you to be Wayuu?

320
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:30,000
What does it mean to be wayuu?

321
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:32,875
Something big, something wonderful.

322
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,500
I feel proud to be wayuu
and I thank Maleiwa,

323
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:40,875
God, because I have known

324
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:44,916
to such a good, beautiful, intelligent woman,
like my grandmother, and that she has taken

325
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:49,208
care of my mom, through her knitting
and through traditional medicine.

326
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:55,125
And me too right now
I'm following Grandma and I'm her replacement.

327
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:56,416
the knowledge,

328
00:29:56,458 --> 00:30:01,041
knowledgeable, because I learned to give birth to a child,

329
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:05,041
I already gave birth to a child, I learned how to be a doctor,

330
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:08,000
and was,

331
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:12,000
It was very difficult because when she came on the road, it was like
And now?, what am I going to do?,

332
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:13,458
there she comes and you could see the little head.

333
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,208
When I saw that the baby began to come out,

334
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:18,625
I said “Teolinda, you can do this!”

335
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:22,291
and the baby came out and when I took the scissors

336
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:26,208
where was she and
I broke the navel and tied it with a thread.

337
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,708
Today the girl is already ten years old, I learned

338
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:32,833
to receive children, (to be a) midwife.

339
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,916
A very nice experience

340
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:42,125
I really liked it, it's like a health center,

341
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:47,000
to receive too. I mean, I didn't study,
I didn't prepare myself, but I prepared myself

342
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:51,083
in my ranch to be a doctor
and to learn about traditional medicine and

343
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:54,250
here I am, with you.

344
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:57,666
Did you also see that putting the collar on
It has a meaning?

345
00:30:57,916 --> 00:31:01,166
This is my protection, my indigenous protection.

346
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,583
This is my protection.

347
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:06,083
This necklace, this is the Tuma, the Wayuu gold.

348
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:10,041
This is my protection that grandma prepared for me

349
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:14,083
for all sickness, health, work,

350
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:18,625
lately for love

351
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:22,541
This is medicine, but with protection.

352
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:33,125
Now, the dream,

353
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,166
we sleep

354
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:40,666
and the next day we come and
we talk to each other, just as we are together

355
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:44,625
we say to each other, good morning what did you dream

356
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:46,125
What did you dream of?

357
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:47,458
Oh me, oh!

358
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,583
What did I dream, oh well…

359
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:51,791
Well, tell me your dream.

360
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:56,791
I dreamed something nice that it was raining,
and everything was green.

361
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,916
That has its meaning. The rain is the tear

362
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:02,041
because it falls from the sky

363
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:05,833
because the tear falls from the eyes downwards,
it is tear

364
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,333
And when it's green
you think that something is going to come, that something is going to be,

365
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:14,125
that the land will produce again.

366
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:17,250
That interprets the dream to us.

367
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:21,458
So we believe a lot in the dream
and believing in the dream,

368
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:27,333
because that dream is already biblical, it's not like
We are going to invent it just because,

369
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:30,750
but because you are going to tell the truth of what you dreamed of,

370
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:35,125
without telling lies
To say that you dreamed, what the dream means, and the dream

371
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:38,083
one has to say it at the moment, speaking

372
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:41,750
means so much and one starts to drink coffee,

373
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:47,333
What else?

374
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:53,166
[Interviewer Well, that talk about the rain,
Well, are the elements sacred in this culture?

375
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:56,083
We identify ourselves with the four elements,

376
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,208
rain,

377
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,208
because we always ask Juya for water,
Manaure is the town that lasts,

378
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:06,916
if it rains a year, it is twice a year, no more water falls again.

379
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:10,166
So with the climate change
is when the problem arises

380
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:13,750
in the form of malnutrition, of begging.

381
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:18,583
Because grandma tells that years ago
all this land was very fruitful.

382
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:24,958
We could sow what was the guajiro bean,
the ahuyama, the watermelon, the melon, the corn, the cassava.

383
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,333
But years ago it changed.

384
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:32,041
Then he showed up, do you know what?
Why did the problem arise?

385
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:37,166
because I always understand that sometimes they say
the wayuu is lazy to work, it's not that,

386
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:41,666
but our wayuu
or we, our relatives never studied,

387
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:45,125
they never went to school
they never learned to speak spanish

388
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,875
and to be able to work you are required to have a diploma,
They demands your resume.

389
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:55,166
But what resume, what diploma
it will give if you never studied and never learned

390
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:59,000
to speak Spanish?, if what they learned
when growing up

391
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:01,750
were the fabrics of our backpack.

392
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:04,333
How to recognize different types and classes of backpack, from Kanasü,

393
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,875
of one thread and what is not Kanasü, that is basic,

394
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:10,208
that we see how it is,

395
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,791
It takes me a week to do it.

396
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:16,208
While that of one month is a month,
because the dedication, the time to make a backpack

397
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:17,541
you have to give value to

398
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:20,958
our backpacks, because one is the one who has

399
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:25,041
to demonstrate the time, the dedication

400
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:28,125
to that backpack when weaving it. also for sleep

401
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:32,708
interpreting our backpack, in our dream
We also interpret our backpacks.

402
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:34,125
Also

403
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:38,291
we interpret dreams, too
In nature.

404
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:41,875
Because if I am going to say, today the cardón,

405
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:45,500
from the heart of the cardón the house is taken
of what he is

406
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,291
yotojoro (dry trunks), is removed from there from the cardón

407
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:52,541
and Cardón also, from the heart of the cardón or the pulp of the

408
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:56,833
cardón also uses it
the one who herds the goats, because there,

409
00:34:56,875 --> 00:35:00,583
because he keeps water in his heart.

410
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,458
In all four elements.

411
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,000
This, for example, the ka'i, the sun is very important,

412
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:09,166
because that was the identification of our grandmothers of the hour.

413
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:13,166
The Kashi, the Kashi

414
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:16,125
Moon,

415
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:20,000
when it's halfway

416
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:22,541
already one is prohibited from cutting the sticks

417
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,750
because the stick is damaged, they become termites

418
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,833
and also with the water, which

419
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:32,166
It's a precious liquid
because without water there is no life

420
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,875
and also the fire.

421
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:40,083
I identify with fire.

422
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:45,208
Many questions have been asked to me about why I identify myself
with fire, because fire is very important,

423
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:50,166
because in the fire, the fire interprets me,
that has a meaning

424
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:53,166
one of those is when the fire…

425
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:56,208
because when you have your firewood off,

426
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,083
your kitchen off, it's because your life is off,

427
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:05,083
You will not find anything, not even a blessing,
because my grandmother says oh, and why

428
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:06,833
Do you have the firewood off?,

429
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:10,250
because there is nothing to cook, there is no food there,
And because there is nothing to cook.

430
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,333
You turned the firewood turned off?, turn that on!

431
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,833
You don't know that

432
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:17,125
God says that one has to have the firewood on,
as long as the fire is on

433
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:19,125
There is life, there is life!

434
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:22,916
Anyone can come with a kilo of rice,
a coffee slip, something, but turn it on! and

435
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:24,833
one turns it on

436
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:28,250
And also at the moment he dies,
as we have two funerals,

437
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:31,583
the first one when we mourn our deceased
and the second one

438
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:35,958
when we began to collect human remains at
five years or six seven.

439
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:40,000
It is the last farewell to our deceased, that the soul goes

440
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:44,583
resting at a place called
Jepira that is at El Cabo de la Vela,

441
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:47,083
and also

442
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:50,083
I identify myself because also when one dies

443
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,125
one has to follow the light,

444
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:55,458
because if your life is dark and

445
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,583
there is no light because your life is turned off.

446
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:01,500
That's why I identify with fire.

447
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:02,125
Well,

448
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:05,958
Now I have a question.

449
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,833
how is it…

450
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:43,875
there is a communication with the spirits or with whom
Are you learning such things from dreams?

451
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:46,500
It may be a relative of one.

452
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:47,916
My grandmother.

453
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,625
She is the one who speaks, she is the one who says.

454
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:52,500
They are ancestral.

455
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,500
It's not just any spirit

456
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,541
it has to be a relative.

457
00:37:55,583 --> 00:38:00,791
It is the one that tells you how to take care of yourself, how to protect yourself,
But, that grandmother is already deceased.

458
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,041
She's already dead.

459
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:05,333
So by dreams, speak, choose a person.

460
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:09,125
Before it was the grandmother,
but she chooses, when she has

461
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,208
at a very old age he has to choose a replacement.

462
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,083
But it is always a familiar.

463
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:20,166
It's not just any bad spirit or anything like that,
but a familiar, as one calls it,

464
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:27,333
our angels.
