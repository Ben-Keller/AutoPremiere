1
00:02:25:08 --> 00:02:28:10
Can you explain to me, who are you and what do you do?

2
00:02:28:11 --> 00:02:32:01
And what ritual are we going to do? anas alika

3
00:02:32:25 --> 00:02:34:14
Good afternoon.

4
00:02:34:15 --> 00:02:35:26
my name is

5
00:02:35:27 --> 00:02:38:12
Teolinda, Wayuu Epiayu

6
00:02:39:01 --> 00:02:43:02
My name is Teolinda from the clan of Epinayu

7
00:02:43:03 --> 00:02:48:05
I am from the walapuinje ranch which means “dreams and interpretations”,

8
00:02:48:06 --> 00:02:50:06
dreams.

9
00:02:50:07 --> 00:02:53:09
Today I am going to tell you about traditional medicine

10
00:02:53:19 --> 00:02:56:06
that I inherited from my grandmother.

11
00:02:57:19 --> 00:02:59:15
As we know

12
00:02:59:16 --> 00:03:04:09
here it is very difficult for one to run towards
a doctor or a health center,

13
00:03:04:29 --> 00:03:09:28
so as we are growing up, our grandmothers taught us to purify

14
00:03:10:03 --> 00:03:12:20
and they taught us about traditional medicine,

15
00:03:13:00 --> 00:03:16:06
how we could cure one of our children.

16
00:03:17:00 --> 00:03:20:11
For example, when the child has diarrhea, we can give him

17
00:03:21:26 --> 00:03:22:22
jawapi a medicinal plant

18
00:03:22:22 --> 00:03:27:18
the jawapi, which is a medicinal plant, helps a lot

19
00:03:27:21 --> 00:03:33:04
to clean the child's organism and that diarrhea can stop and can also

20
00:03:33:05 --> 00:03:38:28
help to clean as if it were a chamomile, but it is a jawapia, made with medicinal plants

21
00:03:39:24 --> 00:03:44:09
and also when the child has a fever or diarrhea or vomiting

22
00:03:44:17 --> 00:03:49:02
We also have this medicine here, we make it,

23
00:03:49:03 --> 00:03:52:16
we take and start right here with the stone

24
00:03:55:13 --> 00:03:56:07
and we put it

25
00:03:56:07 --> 00:03:59:08
in this totumito (container) and we give the baby a drink.

26
00:03:59:25 --> 00:04:02:03
It also helps scare away bad energy.

27
00:04:03:29 --> 00:04:05:03
What plant is it?

28
00:04:05:04 --> 00:04:07:09
This is called kalenasee

29
00:04:08:06 --> 00:04:10:19
Kalenasee is a plant that, just by its

30
00:04:10:20 --> 00:04:12:20
smell, scares away spirits.

31
00:04:43:21 --> 00:04:46:12
Well now in this moment

32
00:04:46:13 --> 00:04:48:27
here is my niece,

33
00:04:49:27 --> 00:04:51:17
She is sick

34
00:04:51:18 --> 00:04:55:16
and I am going to give her medicine that through dreams

35
00:04:55:17 --> 00:04:59:05
Grandma interpreted. She showed me one of the plants

36
00:05:00:06 --> 00:05:04:20
Which one is the medicine that I am going to give her,
because she had an accident

37
00:05:05:06 --> 00:05:10:15
and the accident had her here in the collarbone
and I have to take the medicine

38
00:05:10:26 --> 00:05:15:13
that is called a'tachon,
a´tachon is a medicinal plant medicine,

39
00:05:15:22 --> 00:05:21:17
it also helps a lot to clean the blood
and for the person who also suffers from a fracture

40
00:05:22:01 --> 00:05:25:03
or a very serious injury.

41
00:05:25:22 --> 00:05:29:12
One takes this, attaches it and begins to scratch it

42
00:05:30:13 --> 00:05:32:05
with a stone now

43
00:05:32:13 --> 00:05:33:28
soak it

44
00:05:42:18 --> 00:05:46:03
here with the water

45
00:07:37:08 --> 00:07:43:08
Now it looks as if it was water, all fresh,
So I'm going to give her a drink

46
00:07:43:19 --> 00:07:46:01
for that fracture to heal

47
00:07:48:27 --> 00:07:51:21
do I drink it all? yes my lady, drink it all because it will cure you

48
00:07:54:09 --> 00:07:56:27
The other goes here

49
00:07:56:28 --> 00:08:00:24
I'm going to cure her with a little
what was left to where

50
00:08:02:01 --> 00:08:18:08
has been fractured.

51
00:08:18:09 --> 00:08:20:12
and that

52
00:08:20:19 --> 00:08:23:03
is the bija blanca

53
00:08:23:04 --> 00:08:25:05
this is a very important plant

54
00:08:25:24 --> 00:08:29:09
And
to bathe our boys, or girl.

55
00:08:29:10 --> 00:08:30:07
The moment that,

56
00:08:31:06 --> 00:08:33:10
When a girl has fever

57
00:08:33:24 --> 00:08:38:02
and when you can't sleep at night
as one says,

58
00:08:38:05 --> 00:08:41:17
"She is restless", is when the girl, the baby or the girl

59
00:08:41:29 --> 00:08:45:23
does not sleep well, sleep is
like drowsiness.

60
00:08:45:24 --> 00:08:49:09
Then looking at her, we take the bija,

61
00:08:49:24 --> 00:08:54:11
we start cooking it
we are not going to do that anymore, but we are going to cook it

62
00:08:54:27 --> 00:08:59:13
or it can also be by pieces
we already have it here.

63
00:08:59:14 --> 00:09:02:12
It can also be accompanied by chirrinchi (alcoholic drink).

64
00:09:26:16 --> 00:09:29:12
you'll be fine, it won't hurt anymore

65
00:09:29:27 --> 00:09:33:08
this disease is leaving you

66
00:10:15:21 --> 00:10:17:09
you will be fine

67
00:10:17:09 --> 00:10:44:16
You won't get sick anymore and it won't hurt anymore my girl

68
00:10:46:02 --> 00:10:48:08
that's when the girl, like I was

69
00:10:48:09 --> 00:10:51:12
saying at first that she feels bad,

70
00:10:51:21 --> 00:10:55:17
with flu, wanting to vomit, nauseated.

71
00:10:56:03 --> 00:11:00:04
One cures it with the malua, which is one of the best-known plants.

72
00:11:00:14 --> 00:11:04:02
and to scare what she has,
if she is, well

73
00:11:04:15 --> 00:11:07:14
Feeling like apathetic, that she feels

74
00:11:07:15 --> 00:11:10:06
that her body is not hers, that she is gone,

75
00:11:10:17 --> 00:11:15:05
then through dreams
we dream and see which plant we can cure it with.

76
00:11:15:15 --> 00:11:18:21
They show themselves to us by dream interpretations.

77
00:11:18:22 --> 00:11:23:21
There I saw that in the dream they said that she
they had to scare her away what she has

78
00:11:24:07 --> 00:11:27:01
and try to do a purification

79
00:11:27:02 --> 00:11:29:17
of body through malua

80
00:11:30:12 --> 00:11:34:26
better known as bija.

81
00:11:34:27 --> 00:11:37:08
Is it an energy purification?

82
00:11:37:09 --> 00:11:40:14
Yes, an energy like hers, she is sick

83
00:11:40:28 --> 00:11:44:25
to scare away what she had
or the energy that was already bad

84
00:11:45:08 --> 00:11:49:07
and suddenly they scare it with something
cold that is the chirrinchi (alcoholic drink) and also with the medicine

85
00:11:49:13 --> 00:11:52:03
she's going to feel good
everything she had wrong

86
00:11:52:09 --> 00:11:55:27
She will get her energy back.

87
00:11:56:16 --> 00:11:58:21
Well, in her case, the flu,

88
00:12:00:05 --> 00:12:02:03
we have

89
00:12:02:25 --> 00:12:04:26
We also have the

90
00:12:04:27 --> 00:12:08:26
with the

91
00:12:09:29 --> 00:12:12:15
kalenakalu, this one

92
00:12:12:16 --> 00:12:14:12
three together,

93
00:12:15:15 --> 00:12:17:29
these plants heal

94
00:12:18:00 --> 00:12:23:03
the flu disease, of the asthmatic person

95
00:12:23:19 --> 00:12:26:27
doing vaporization and by drink

96
00:12:27:07 --> 00:12:29:16
and the vaporization with sea salt.

97
00:12:30:12 --> 00:12:33:25
One of those who fought a lot
With the COVID disease

98
00:12:34:03 --> 00:12:37:07
It was this wonderful (plant) that you see here,

99
00:12:37:08 --> 00:12:39:18
doing the vaporization with the sea salt.

100
00:12:40:08 --> 00:12:44:04
All three of them together
Are mixed and you have to drink it

101
00:12:44:14 --> 00:12:49:18
before coffee or breakfast
because it is already in the morning.

102
00:12:50:01 --> 00:12:54:19
It is the first thing that before drinking coffee, to
drink this for the flu.

103
00:12:55:16 --> 00:12:59:08
It heals our children quite a lot,
is the only medicine

104
00:12:59:09 --> 00:13:04:28
that we use in our ranch.

105
00:13:04:29 --> 00:13:07:29
when our children

106
00:13:08:01 --> 00:13:11:05
or when there is diarrhea

107
00:13:11:21 --> 00:13:14:26
very strong that the diarrhea comes with blood.

108
00:13:14:27 --> 00:13:17:20
This is called turio'u, the turio'u

109
00:13:18:18 --> 00:13:20:24
or itachon (because of its cup shape)

110
00:13:21:07 --> 00:13:23:10
It is when one begins to scratch the itachon,

111
00:13:24:03 --> 00:13:26:06
already scratched,

112
00:13:26:24 --> 00:13:36:13
touch,

113
00:13:36:14 --> 00:13:41:15
A red, pinkish color comes out, that is the one that will cure

114
00:13:42:03 --> 00:13:44:08
to the person who has diarrhea

115
00:13:48:19 --> 00:13:50:16
it's called wainruin'ou,

116
00:13:50:17 --> 00:13:54:16
This wainruin'ou medicine

117
00:14:03:02 --> 00:14:04:21
Do you see the color?

118
00:14:05:08 --> 00:14:07:10
wainruin'ou is for diarrhea.

119
00:14:08:23 --> 00:14:09:09
Let's say,

120
00:14:09:09 --> 00:14:13:01
Our children drink it and it helps a lot to stop the diarrhea

121
00:14:13:16 --> 00:14:16:02
So the diarrhea no longer continues for the child or the lady.

122
00:14:16:16 --> 00:14:19:19
When diarrhea comes with blood, it is already accompanied

123
00:14:19:20 --> 00:14:22:17
of the turi´ou of the wainruin´ou (plants) with this

124
00:14:22:28 --> 00:14:25:13
which is called palisa or kinou'ta,

125
00:14:27:00 --> 00:14:29:01
that is the red medicine

126
00:14:29:21 --> 00:14:32:11
And they are sticks and this is dry too,

127
00:14:32:12 --> 00:14:36:14
all three are cooked together and you start drinking it

128
00:14:36:15 --> 00:14:40:17
twice a week, Monday and Tuesday,

129
00:14:40:25 --> 00:14:43:11
Then the other week Monday and Tuesday.

130
00:14:43:19 --> 00:14:52:12
And so on, until the diarrhea goes away.

131
00:15:49:29 --> 00:15:52:25
Drink it just a little

132
00:15:59:29 --> 00:16:01:17
and it must be very bitter

133
00:16:01:18 --> 00:16:05:22
so it can stop the diarrhea.

134
00:16:06:10 --> 00:16:07:10
On the other hand,

135
00:16:08:12 --> 00:16:10:25
we have here the kasuou

136
00:16:12:27 --> 00:16:13:24
when our children

137
00:16:13:24 --> 00:16:16:15
girls develop at the age of 12,

138
00:16:17:07 --> 00:16:21:15
we also have to purify the body with jawapia,
clean the body

139
00:16:22:06 --> 00:16:24:24
In order to have the girl

140
00:16:24:25 --> 00:16:29:23
with firm skin forever and that she enjoys
eternal youth,

141
00:16:30:06 --> 00:16:33:14
We give you the mou'a, the mou'a is the dove

142
00:16:34:00 --> 00:16:39:09
and we cook it as if it was soup
and as a traditional drink so that she

143
00:16:39:10 --> 00:16:42:29
Can have very clean skin
and to stay well,

144
00:16:43:09 --> 00:16:47:07
it is called kasuo´u (white bun), a stone

145
00:16:47:17 --> 00:16:50:17
kasuo´u The drink of the majayut (lady)

146
00:16:51:08 --> 00:16:55:15
or the confinement drink or the young lady drink.

147
00:17:06:23 --> 00:17:08:24
well and

148
00:17:09:12 --> 00:17:11:20
one of those is the,

149
00:17:12:19 --> 00:17:17:13
the bath to purify the body,
the bath

150
00:17:17:14 --> 00:17:22:01
tries that when there is a problem, there are many kinds of problem.

151
00:17:22:02 --> 00:17:26:10
For example, it may be the problem of death
or the problem

152
00:17:26:11 --> 00:17:31:25
when there is controversy
for example, with the territories,

153
00:17:32:02 --> 00:17:34:26
one has to find a way to take a bath

154
00:17:35:02 --> 00:17:37:19
to scare away that problem, so that it goes away,

155
00:17:37:27 --> 00:17:42:12
To avoid a problem between the two families,

156
00:17:42:20 --> 00:17:45:16
that family has to stay united

157
00:17:45:17 --> 00:17:48:15
and for this problem it is necessary to look for the solution.

158
00:17:48:25 --> 00:17:50:26
And then, how do we do it?, with the bath

159
00:17:51:17 --> 00:17:53:28
Basically all medicines are already together

160
00:17:53:29 --> 00:17:55:13
which is the bath

161
00:17:57:29 --> 00:17:58:19
That already comes

162
00:17:58:19 --> 00:18:02:19
with chirrinchi that's already cold

163
00:18:03:14 --> 00:18:07:05
and start to do the bath, scare it from behind

164
00:18:07:21 --> 00:18:13:02
so that when it goes, move there, look there

165
00:18:15:26 --> 00:18:18:03
well, with the totuma like this,

166
00:18:18:04 --> 00:18:20:17
one does it like that, scaring

167
00:18:21:17 --> 00:18:23:16
The bad energy

168
00:18:23:17 --> 00:18:26:03
so that this problem does not come back

169
00:18:26:15 --> 00:18:29:27
and she has to push it away and let her talk

170
00:18:30:11 --> 00:18:35:01
and tell it to go to the bottom of the sea, taking also
of course

171
00:18:35:04 --> 00:18:39:09
the lania (amulet or charm), begins…
I'm going to take out the lania.

172
00:18:40:01 --> 00:18:44:00
The lania is a tiny backpack

173
00:18:45:00 --> 00:18:48:20
That Lania is Grandma's.

174
00:19:20:14 --> 00:19:23:15
jawapia

175
00:19:23:16 --> 00:19:25:22
This jawapia you have to try to scratch it

176
00:19:25:27 --> 00:19:28:17
to do the girl's bath, to scare the

177
00:19:29:02 --> 00:19:32:19
problematic, move away that problem

178
00:19:32:27 --> 00:19:35:19
so that none of the family will be touched,
nor the family

179
00:19:35:20 --> 00:19:39:23
of the young

180
00:19:39:24 --> 00:19:40:22
It's called jawapia

181
00:19:42:08 --> 00:19:44:15
a medicinal green plant

182
00:19:44:16 --> 00:19:48:14
that has its name,
but it's grandma's secret.

183
00:19:49:09 --> 00:19:52:17
You don't have to say,
but you have to show nothing more than medicine,

184
00:19:52:18 --> 00:19:56:05
because one never reveals
what is something important to her.

185
00:19:56:06 --> 00:20:00:02
You must keep it, you can take it

186
00:20:00:03 --> 00:20:04:04
with your own hands,

187
00:20:04:05 --> 00:20:05:14
The plant.

188
00:20:54:09 --> 00:20:56:13
This is the lania

189
00:20:57:20 --> 00:20:58:23
of the grandmother

190
00:21:00:28 --> 00:21:04:04
You pick it up and starts to

191
00:21:04:05 --> 00:21:07:22
take away anything evil there is

192
00:21:09:06 --> 00:21:12:23
take what’s evil to the bottom of the sea, let no evil come near here

193
00:21:13:07 --> 00:21:17:06
so that it does not affect our guests. God I ask you

194
00:21:18:20 --> 00:21:21:08
who entrusted me with this plant to protect people.

195
00:21:21:09 --> 00:21:24:22
Scaring away with this, it is the grandmother's lania,

196
00:21:25:12 --> 00:21:30:09
pushing away what comes above,
if it’s a territory problem

197
00:21:30:10 --> 00:21:34:07
or death problem,
and one has to find a way to cleanse oneself,

198
00:21:34:16 --> 00:21:39:17
to purify oneself and we can also find the stone
with indigenous protection.

199
00:21:39:18 --> 00:21:41:28
And that was also because of grandmother's interpretations

200
00:21:47:07 --> 00:21:49:00
That are these stones

201
00:21:49:01 --> 00:21:52:13
It is called tuma or cornalina

202
00:21:54:12 --> 00:21:55:24
to try to get clean

203
00:21:55:24 --> 00:22:00:13
and protect yourself.

204
00:22:10:08 --> 00:22:14:03
As you can see also jawapia is drinkable,

205
00:22:15:17 --> 00:22:18:20
It is drinkable so that it stays in one's stomach,

206
00:22:18:21 --> 00:22:23:06
whether a person comes to
dare to seek to kill,

207
00:22:23:07 --> 00:22:28:15
He comes looking for death, he doesn't,
because it is protected by this jawapia in the stomach.

208
00:22:29:27 --> 00:22:33:15
And the same goes with the protections.

209
00:22:40:11 --> 00:22:42:03
Ask, ask.

210
00:22:42:04 --> 00:22:43:20
Where does all knowledge come from?

211
00:22:43:21 --> 00:22:47:29
Well, that knowledge comes from the
Grandma, it is ancestral, but as

212
00:22:48:00 --> 00:22:50:12
I tell you at the age of 12 we learn a lot.

213
00:22:50:22 --> 00:22:53:05
That is why one says that education comes from home.

214
00:22:53:13 --> 00:22:57:13
What we learn first is from our elders
and traditional medicine

215
00:22:57:17 --> 00:23:02:03
we inherited it, it is an inheritance for us,
because when we are in growing up

216
00:23:02:05 --> 00:23:05:13
They show us or teach us about
traditional medicine

217
00:23:05:21 --> 00:23:09:13
and teach us about values
and that is ancestral

218
00:23:10:07 --> 00:23:13:10
How does one choose to be knowledgeable?

219
00:23:13:13 --> 00:23:16:27
Well, when Grandma is very old,
For example, 90 years old,

220
00:23:17:07 --> 00:23:20:26
she has to search and she won't tell you
You're going to replace me

221
00:23:21:05 --> 00:23:26:06
she begins to dream and in her dreams,
she chooses the person who is going to replace her.

222
00:23:26:15 --> 00:23:31:04
And that person that she chooses,
she has already analyzed it, and sits it down,

223
00:23:31:12 --> 00:23:35:22
he sits with her,
begins to teach him his gifts, his wisdom,

224
00:23:36:00 --> 00:23:39:06
what does each plant mean,
What is each plant for?

225
00:23:39:13 --> 00:23:41:14
Look at this, you're going to dream

226
00:23:42:13 --> 00:23:44:20
and they will show you through your dreams

227
00:23:44:26 --> 00:23:48:26
the medicine you are going to use.

228
00:23:48:27 --> 00:23:50:28
Is it spiritual then?

229
00:23:51:22 --> 00:23:55:29
Spiritual yes, Spiritual, of course,
because you know that is also biblical, too

230
00:23:56:00 --> 00:23:58:16
when in the time of Jesus he sends

231
00:23:58:17 --> 00:24:00:28
to José, for the dream

232
00:24:01:16 --> 00:24:06:02
that he had, that he had
to reveal dreams to the Egyptians

233
00:24:06:19 --> 00:24:09:28
of the seven plagues
and they never believed, and from the famine

234
00:24:10:09 --> 00:24:13:02
and it really came. once one

235
00:24:13:03 --> 00:24:16:04
for dreams, one also has to go through the line of

236
00:24:16:05 --> 00:24:18:20
that and believe,
because the truth is that a dream,

237
00:24:19:14 --> 00:24:21:16
It's not a game, it's a dream.

238
00:24:21:22 --> 00:24:25:29
And that dream must be treated if it is bad,
you have to push it away like I was doing to the girl,

239
00:24:26:06 --> 00:24:30:22
scare away that dream
that they dreamed for her, take all that away from her.

240
00:24:32:17 --> 00:24:34:17
That's what the dream is about

241
00:24:34:18 --> 00:24:36:19
and it has to do with traditional medicine.

242
00:24:37:23 --> 00:24:38:12
And all that?

243
00:24:38:12 --> 00:24:41:09
It's like a story or a

244
00:24:41:10 --> 00:24:42:24
knowledge?

245
00:24:42:25 --> 00:24:45:12
Knowledge, a knowledge.

246
00:25:02:01 --> 00:25:04:26
That's called piachi

247
00:25:04:27 --> 00:25:05:24
medical,

248
00:25:05:25 --> 00:25:06:06
medical

249
00:25:06:06 --> 00:25:10:22
ancestral, has its piachi name in parentheses

250
00:25:10:23 --> 00:25:13:25
(ancestral medicine) and the piache can also help on deliveries

251
00:25:14:26 --> 00:25:19:02
when a girl is pregnant
and the child is wrong, because he can

252
00:25:19:03 --> 00:25:24:18
one to compose lifting it here from the waist to here
so that baby can be located in its place.

253
00:25:24:25 --> 00:25:26:29
Then on the birth day,there will not have difficulty.

254
00:25:29:04 --> 00:25:32:06
You can say that word, lapuja.

255
00:25:32:13 --> 00:25:34:21
Dreams, lapu'je yes, lapu'je

256
00:25:34:24 --> 00:25:37:15
Sure, as I was saying earlier
That

257
00:25:37:23 --> 00:25:41:14
grandma tells which person
she is going to choose, she dreams first, lapu'je

258
00:25:42:14 --> 00:25:47:21
Dream.

259
00:25:55:24 --> 00:25:58:16
One more thing, how do plants taste?

260
00:25:58:24 --> 00:26:02:21
Because I have knowledge of those plants, I learned,
It's like the doctor

261
00:26:02:22 --> 00:26:05:26
the one who studies to study,
For example, headache.

262
00:26:05:27 --> 00:26:10:06
I can grab a chirrinchi
I put it on my head, my headache goes away

263
00:26:10:07 --> 00:26:14:09
because I know that it is good for a headache,
for diarrhea that comes with blood

264
00:26:14:10 --> 00:26:18:06
I know what it is, it’s this one, I start to scratch it
and I take it

265
00:26:18:12 --> 00:26:21:27
or I give it to drink, because honestly
maybe no medicine can cure it,

266
00:26:22:03 --> 00:26:24:29
but suddenly this can cure it
because we have had some cases.

267
00:26:25:23 --> 00:26:29:06
A case, an example,
a man who was evicted in a wheelchair,

268
00:26:29:16 --> 00:26:31:28
came from Italy, where science is most advanced

269
00:26:32:12 --> 00:26:34:15
and they evicted him in a wheelchair.

270
00:26:34:28 --> 00:26:37:24
He came here, here to Manaure to visit, like you

271
00:26:38:00 --> 00:26:42:04
As a tourist and I received it
and I told my grandmother that there is a man

272
00:26:42:05 --> 00:26:46:15
who is in a wheelchair,
but he was evicted because he cannot walk for life.

273
00:26:46:23 --> 00:26:51:04
My grandmother told me for God nothing is impossible,
maleiwa, for him nothing is impossible.

274
00:26:51:11 --> 00:26:54:10
Maleiwa is God and if He shows me in a dream

275
00:26:54:11 --> 00:26:56:28
What I can cure this man with, yes it can be cured.

276
00:26:57:11 --> 00:26:59:29
They showed him it was sea salt,
and the salt raised it

277
00:27:00:02 --> 00:27:03:04
marine along with a massage

278
00:27:03:05 --> 00:27:03:29
nothing more, and with chirrinchi.

279
00:27:05:02 --> 00:27:07:16
And nowadays, this man walks with crutches

280
00:27:07:17 --> 00:27:10:24
when science said he’d be on a wheelchair
for the rest of his life,

281
00:27:11:00 --> 00:27:13:28
He was lifted by a Wayuu woman.

282
00:27:14:01 --> 00:27:15:14
Faith,

283
00:27:15:24 --> 00:27:20:15
and faith moves mountains.

284
00:27:20:16 --> 00:27:21:27
May I introduce you

285
00:27:21:27 --> 00:27:26:28
again, like who are you and what do you do

286
00:27:27:10 --> 00:27:29:08
and where are we?

287
00:27:29:09 --> 00:27:33:09
Okay, yes. Anas aliika, good afternoon, tanulia

288
00:27:33:24 --> 00:27:37:11
My name is Teolinda from the Epiyu clan.

289
00:27:37:12 --> 00:27:40:01
I am a Wayuu indigenous

290
00:27:40:12 --> 00:27:43:15
one of those who is, one of the knowers, one of the

291
00:27:44:00 --> 00:27:46:09
piachi (medical) obtained by grandmother,

292
00:27:46:16 --> 00:27:49:09
since she is very old.

293
00:27:49:10 --> 00:27:50:29
She already has her replacement.

294
00:27:51:00 --> 00:27:55:12
Little by little she is leaving her gifts, her wisdom
and that is through lapu'je,

295
00:27:56:00 --> 00:27:58:07
dream interpretations.

296
00:27:58:19 --> 00:28:01:26
We are here in the walapuinje ranch, which means dream,

297
00:28:02:15 --> 00:28:05:23
anayawatsu

298
00:28:06:24 --> 00:28:08:24
anayawatsu is thank you.

299
00:28:08:25 --> 00:28:10:26
And the last thing is that if you have a message.

300
00:28:11:08 --> 00:28:14:28
Well, the message that I am going to give you is that

301
00:28:14:29 --> 00:28:17:20
Us, the wayuu, the idea is that this

302
00:28:18:22 --> 00:28:23:12
stays with our grandchildren, with our children,
with our grandchildren, not to be missed.

303
00:28:23:22 --> 00:28:28:10
We want you to know our
medicine, just as they have their medicine,

304
00:28:28:11 --> 00:28:32:16
we also have our traditional medicine
that we got from grandma.

305
00:28:32:26 --> 00:28:36:02
Thanks to maleiwa (God),
that is everything, He is who created the plants

306
00:28:36:09 --> 00:28:39:13
and we are using all those plants to cure those who are sick.

307
00:28:40:02 --> 00:28:43:10
I invite you to come
and can make a good purification

308
00:28:43:11 --> 00:28:46:19
here in the walapuinje ranch,

309
00:28:46:21 --> 00:28:49:21
If you feel sick, if you feel something, come here

310
00:28:49:22 --> 00:28:52:13
I wait for you here, here in the Walapuinje ranch

311
00:28:53:06 --> 00:28:56:11
The knowing woman Teolinda, Thank you..

312
00:29:05:00 --> 00:29:07:28
the way she interprets dreams

313
00:29:07:29 --> 00:29:09:12
How do you know?

314
00:29:09:12 --> 00:29:11:19
I dream, I sleep and

315
00:29:12:03 --> 00:29:16:29
the next day we sat down with a coffee

316
00:29:17:00 --> 00:29:18:05
Juana bring me coffee please

317
00:29:21:03 --> 00:29:22:14
rinse it first

318
00:29:22:14 --> 00:29:25:12
Now I am going to tell you how they interpret the dream.

319
00:29:25:13 --> 00:29:28:16
And what does it mean to you to be Wayuu?

320
00:29:28:17 --> 00:29:30:00
What does it mean to be wayuu?

321
00:29:30:01 --> 00:29:32:21
Something big, something wonderful.

322
00:29:33:12 --> 00:29:37:12
I feel proud to be wayuu
and I thank Maleiwa,

323
00:29:37:14 --> 00:29:40:21
God, because I have known

324
00:29:40:22 --> 00:29:44:22
to such a good, beautiful, intelligent woman,
like my grandmother, and that she has taken

325
00:29:44:23 --> 00:29:49:05
care of my mom, through her knitting
and through traditional medicine.

326
00:29:49:19 --> 00:29:54:27
And me too right now
I'm following Grandma and I'm her replacement.

327
00:29:55:07 --> 00:29:56:10
the knowledge,

328
00:29:56:11 --> 00:30:00:25
knowledgeable, because I learned to give birth to a child,

329
00:30:01:19 --> 00:30:05:01
I already gave birth to a child, I learned how to be a doctor,

330
00:30:05:17 --> 00:30:08:00
and was,

331
00:30:08:03 --> 00:30:11:24
It was very difficult because when she came on the road, it was like
And now?, what am I going to do?,

332
00:30:11:25 --> 00:30:13:11
there she comes and you could see the little head.

333
00:30:13:12 --> 00:30:16:05
When I saw that the baby began to come out,

334
00:30:16:08 --> 00:30:18:15
I said “Teolinda, you can do this!”

335
00:30:18:27 --> 00:30:22:07
and the baby came out and when I took the scissors

336
00:30:22:08 --> 00:30:25:29
where was she and
I broke the navel and tied it with a thread.

337
00:30:26:00 --> 00:30:29:17
Today the girl is already ten years old, I learned

338
00:30:30:19 --> 00:30:32:20
to receive children, (to be a) midwife.

339
00:30:35:19 --> 00:30:37:22
A very nice experience

340
00:30:38:05 --> 00:30:42:03
I really liked it, it's like a health center,

341
00:30:42:21 --> 00:30:46:24
to receive too. I mean, I didn't study,
I didn't prepare myself, but I prepared myself

342
00:30:46:25 --> 00:30:50:26
in my ranch to be a doctor
and to learn about traditional medicine and

343
00:30:50:27 --> 00:30:54:06
here I am, with you.

344
00:30:54:07 --> 00:30:57:16
Did you also see that putting the collar on
It has a meaning?

345
00:30:57:22 --> 00:31:01:04
This is my protection, my indigenous protection.

346
00:31:01:18 --> 00:31:02:14
This is my protection.

347
00:31:02:14 --> 00:31:06:02
This necklace, this is the Tuma, the Wayuu gold.

348
00:31:07:11 --> 00:31:10:01
This is my protection that grandma prepared for me

349
00:31:10:19 --> 00:31:14:02
for all sickness, health, work,

350
00:31:15:03 --> 00:31:18:15
lately for love

351
00:31:18:16 --> 00:31:22:13
This is medicine, but with protection.

352
00:31:29:14 --> 00:31:32:27
Now, the dream,

353
00:31:34:17 --> 00:31:36:04
we sleep

354
00:31:36:11 --> 00:31:40:16
and the next day we come and
we talk to each other, just as we are together

355
00:31:40:27 --> 00:31:44:15
we say to each other, good morning what did you dream

356
00:31:44:16 --> 00:31:45:27
What did you dream of?

357
00:31:45:28 --> 00:31:47:11
Oh me, oh!

358
00:31:47:11 --> 00:31:49:14
What did I dream, oh well…

359
00:31:49:15 --> 00:31:51:19
Well, tell me your dream.

360
00:31:51:20 --> 00:31:56:19
I dreamed something nice that it was raining,
and everything was green.

361
00:31:56:23 --> 00:31:59:22
That has its meaning. The rain is the tear

362
00:32:00:25 --> 00:32:01:25
because it falls from the sky

363
00:32:01:25 --> 00:32:05:20
because the tear falls from the eyes downwards,
it is tear

364
00:32:06:00 --> 00:32:11:08
And when it's green
you think that something is going to come, that something is going to be,

365
00:32:11:11 --> 00:32:14:03
that the land will produce again.

366
00:32:14:13 --> 00:32:17:06
That interprets the dream to us.

367
00:32:17:07 --> 00:32:21:11
So we believe a lot in the dream
and believing in the dream,

368
00:32:21:18 --> 00:32:27:08
because that dream is already biblical, it's not like
We are going to invent it just because,

369
00:32:27:15 --> 00:32:30:18
but because you are going to tell the truth of what you dreamed of,

370
00:32:30:27 --> 00:32:35:03
without telling lies
To say that you dreamed, what the dream means, and the dream

371
00:32:35:04 --> 00:32:37:26
one has to say it at the moment, speaking

372
00:32:37:27 --> 00:32:41:18
means so much and one starts to drink coffee,

373
00:32:44:26 --> 00:32:47:08
What else?

374
00:32:47:09 --> 00:32:52:28
[Interviewer Well, that talk about the rain,
Well, are the elements sacred in this culture?

375
00:32:53:01 --> 00:32:55:26
We identify ourselves with the four elements,

376
00:32:56:17 --> 00:32:58:29
rain,

377
00:32:59:00 --> 00:33:02:29
because we always ask Juya for water,
Manaure is the town that lasts,

378
00:33:03:08 --> 00:33:06:22
if it rains a year, it is twice a year, no more water falls again.

379
00:33:06:23 --> 00:33:10:04
So with the climate change
is when the problem arises

380
00:33:10:23 --> 00:33:13:18
in the form of malnutrition, of begging.

381
00:33:14:01 --> 00:33:18:14
Because grandma tells that years ago
all this land was very fruitful.

382
00:33:18:15 --> 00:33:24:23
We could sow what was the guajiro bean,
the ahuyama, the watermelon, the melon, the corn, the cassava.

383
00:33:24:24 --> 00:33:27:08
But years ago it changed.

384
00:33:27:09 --> 00:33:32:01
Then he showed up, do you know what?
Why did the problem arise?

385
00:33:32:11 --> 00:33:37:04
because I always understand that sometimes they say
the wayuu is lazy to work, it's not that,

386
00:33:37:11 --> 00:33:41:16
but our wayuu
or we, our relatives never studied,

387
00:33:42:07 --> 00:33:45:03
they never went to school
they never learned to speak spanish

388
00:33:45:12 --> 00:33:50:21
and to be able to work you are required to have a diploma,
They demands your resume.

389
00:33:50:29 --> 00:33:54:28
But what resume, what diploma
it will give if you never studied and never learned

390
00:33:54:29 --> 00:33:59:00
to speak Spanish?, if what they learned
when growing up

391
00:33:59:10 --> 00:34:01:18
were the fabrics of our backpack.

392
00:34:01:19 --> 00:34:04:08
How to recognize different types and classes of backpack, from Kanasü,

393
00:34:04:09 --> 00:34:07:21
of one thread and what is not Kanasü, that is basic,

394
00:34:07:23 --> 00:34:09:29
that we see how it is,

395
00:34:10:00 --> 00:34:11:19
It takes me a week to do it.

396
00:34:11:19 --> 00:34:16:05
While that of one month is a month,
because the dedication, the time to make a backpack

397
00:34:16:17 --> 00:34:17:13
you have to give value to

398
00:34:17:13 --> 00:34:20:23
our backpacks, because one is the one who has

399
00:34:21:07 --> 00:34:24:25
to demonstrate the time, the dedication

400
00:34:24:26 --> 00:34:27:27
to that backpack when weaving it. also for sleep

401
00:34:27:28 --> 00:34:32:17
interpreting our backpack, in our dream
We also interpret our backpacks.

402
00:34:33:25 --> 00:34:34:03
Also

403
00:34:34:04 --> 00:34:38:07
we interpret dreams, too
In nature.

404
00:34:38:19 --> 00:34:41:21
Because if I am going to say, today the cardón,

405
00:34:42:23 --> 00:34:45:12
from the heart of the cardón the house is taken
of what he is

406
00:34:45:13 --> 00:34:48:07
yotojoro (dry trunks), is removed from there from the cardón

407
00:34:48:14 --> 00:34:52:13
and Cardón also, from the heart of the cardón or the pulp of the

408
00:34:52:14 --> 00:34:56:20
cardón also uses it
the one who herds the goats, because there,

409
00:34:56:21 --> 00:35:00:14
because he keeps water in his heart.

410
00:35:00:27 --> 00:35:02:11
In all four elements.

411
00:35:02:12 --> 00:35:06:00
This, for example, the ka'i, the sun is very important,

412
00:35:06:15 --> 00:35:09:04
because that was the identification of our grandmothers of the hour.

413
00:35:09:05 --> 00:35:12:28
The Kashi, the Kashi

414
00:35:13:19 --> 00:35:16:03
Moon,

415
00:35:16:27 --> 00:35:19:24
when it's halfway

416
00:35:19:25 --> 00:35:22:13
already one is prohibited from cutting the sticks

417
00:35:22:26 --> 00:35:25:18
because the stick is damaged, they become termites

418
00:35:26:22 --> 00:35:28:20
and also with the water, which

419
00:35:28:20 --> 00:35:31:28
It's a precious liquid
because without water there is no life

420
00:35:33:12 --> 00:35:35:21
and also the fire.

421
00:35:37:03 --> 00:35:40:02
I identify with fire.

422
00:35:40:03 --> 00:35:45:05
Many questions have been asked to me about why I identify myself
with fire, because fire is very important,

423
00:35:45:21 --> 00:35:49:28
because in the fire, the fire interprets me,
that has a meaning

424
00:35:50:08 --> 00:35:52:28
one of those is when the fire…

425
00:35:53:07 --> 00:35:55:29
because when you have your firewood off,

426
00:35:56:00 --> 00:35:59:02
your kitchen off, it's because your life is off,

427
00:35:59:17 --> 00:36:04:26
You will not find anything, not even a blessing,
because my grandmother says oh, and why

428
00:36:04:27 --> 00:36:06:20
Do you have the firewood off?,

429
00:36:06:21 --> 00:36:10:06
because there is nothing to cook, there is no food there,
And because there is nothing to cook.

430
00:36:10:12 --> 00:36:12:08
You turned the firewood turned off?, turn that on!

431
00:36:12:08 --> 00:36:13:20
You don't know that

432
00:36:13:21 --> 00:36:17:03
God says that one has to have the firewood on,
as long as the fire is on

433
00:36:17:10 --> 00:36:19:03
There is life, there is life!

434
00:36:19:03 --> 00:36:22:22
Anyone can come with a kilo of rice,
a coffee slip, something, but turn it on! and

435
00:36:23:08 --> 00:36:24:20
one turns it on

436
00:36:24:21 --> 00:36:28:06
And also at the moment he dies,
as we have two funerals,

437
00:36:28:07 --> 00:36:31:14
the first one when we mourn our deceased
and the second one

438
00:36:31:15 --> 00:36:35:23
when we began to collect human remains at
five years or six seven.

439
00:36:36:07 --> 00:36:40:00
It is the last farewell to our deceased, that the soul goes

440
00:36:40:01 --> 00:36:44:14
resting at a place called
Jepira that is at El Cabo de la Vela,

441
00:36:45:16 --> 00:36:46:26
and also

442
00:36:46:27 --> 00:36:49:26
I identify myself because also when one dies

443
00:36:50:13 --> 00:36:52:27
one has to follow the light,

444
00:36:53:08 --> 00:36:55:11
because if your life is dark and

445
00:36:55:12 --> 00:36:57:14
there is no light because your life is turned off.

446
00:36:58:02 --> 00:37:01:12
That's why I identify with fire.

447
00:37:01:20 --> 00:37:01:27
Well,

448
00:37:03:16 --> 00:37:05:23
Now I have a question.

449
00:37:36:04 --> 00:37:38:20
how is it…

450
00:37:38:21 --> 00:37:43:21
there is a communication with the spirits or with whom
Are you learning such things from dreams?

451
00:37:44:02 --> 00:37:46:12
It may be a relative of one.

452
00:37:46:22 --> 00:37:47:22
My grandmother.

453
00:37:48:10 --> 00:37:50:15
She is the one who speaks, she is the one who says.

454
00:37:50:16 --> 00:37:52:12
They are ancestral.

455
00:37:52:12 --> 00:37:53:12
It's not just any spirit

456
00:37:53:12 --> 00:37:55:13
it has to be a relative.

457
00:37:55:14 --> 00:38:00:19
It is the one that tells you how to take care of yourself, how to protect yourself,
But, that grandmother is already deceased.

458
00:38:00:20 --> 00:38:02:01
She's already dead.

459
00:38:02:02 --> 00:38:05:08
So by dreams, speak, choose a person.

460
00:38:05:19 --> 00:38:08:27
Before it was the grandmother,
but she chooses, when she has

461
00:38:09:00 --> 00:38:12:29
at a very old age he has to choose a replacement.

462
00:38:13:00 --> 00:38:15:02
But it is always a familiar.

463
00:38:15:03 --> 00:38:20:04
It's not just any bad spirit or anything like that,
but a familiar, as one calls it,

464
00:38:20:05 --> 00:38:27:08
our angels.
