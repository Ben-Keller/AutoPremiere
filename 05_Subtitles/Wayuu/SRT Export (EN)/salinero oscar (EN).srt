1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Tell us your name what do you do for living

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Oscar Pushaina.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And what do you do here?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I come here to work with salt

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Sometimes I arrive here at dawn, at 4 in the morning

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And I leave around ten

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
At the very least

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And since what age have you worked here?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have been here for 25 years

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, and the salt, how is it made? or what is the process?

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:23,000
how is it done?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The saltwater is poured over there to evaporate there

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And then it is passed here so that it curdles here

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And the crystal is formed

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And how important is that mineral in your life?

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Can you be more specific about the question?

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
When did you start working here? Yeah
Did you start small or what?

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Well I said that I have been here for 25 years

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, but could you tell us from what age did you start?
And then how long have you been here?

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I have been working with salt for 25 years.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And regarding the last question

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
About the importance of the salt? Why is it so necessary?
can you tell us

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
How do you get to work here?
you can comment us now

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
For us, salt is important for food

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
To help us with the needs

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And what relationship does it have with the environment?

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
With the elements, with the rain, with the sea or with the wind

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The question he asked you is why is salt formed
here and not somewhere else?

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why precisely here?

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That I don't know

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Here where the salt is, the sun is hot
and there is breeze right? Yeah.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The sea is salty, but specifically
here it is even saltier

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So since it is saltier here, there is more sun and breeze when the water passes

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It crystallizes, if you tell us more about it

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You can say it in wayuunaiki too

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It is formed by the sun, the water evaporates and the
breeze is drying it

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
When it rains you can't process the salt or anything

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But when the sun is very hot we work
more and we earn more

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Can you tell us a bit if this came from your grandparents?
Your interest in salt

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How did you get interested? or how did you learn?

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Who did you learn this from? because there is always one
who learned it first

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes, was it the job of your grandparents or your parents?

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yes, of course it was the job of our parents.
When we were children our parents

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
brought us to learn the job and once learned
we started working on our own and then they retired

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Many speak of salt as an energy that has
something more spiritual

46
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
With the wind and all the elements together, right?

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Does that have a spiritual implication for you?
or is that seen in production somehow?

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
About this

49
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
University students say that salt has a
spiritual connotation in the sense that

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It is used for spiritual purposes

51
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That in our culture I don't know since salt is
just for food

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Because it flavors the food. also for sale

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But, our grandparents previously exchanged it.
Yes, they exchanged it with beans, corn

54
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
With food like grains

55
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Now they sell it for money, to buy clothes
or for the school expenses of our children

56
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Or we buy our watch, phone or bicycle,
thanks to this job

57
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
OK, thanks a lot.
