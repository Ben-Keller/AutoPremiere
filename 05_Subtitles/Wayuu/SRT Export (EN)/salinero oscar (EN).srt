1
00:04 --> 00:06
Tell us your name what do you do for living

2
00:07 --> 00:10
My name is Oscar Pushaina.

3
00:11 --> 00:12
And what do you do here?

4
00:13 --> 00:16
I come here to work with salt

5
00:17 --> 00:22
Sometimes I arrive here at dawn, at 4 in the morning

6
00:23 --> 00:24
And I leave around ten

7
00:26 --> 00:27
At the very least

8
00:28 --> 00:29
And since what age have you worked here?

9
00:31 --> 00:35
I have been here for 25 years

10
00:37 --> 00:41
Well, and the salt, how is it made? or what is the process?

11
00:42 --> 00:23
how is it done?

12
00:45 --> 00:51
The saltwater is poured over there to evaporate there

13
00:52 --> 00:57
And then it is passed here so that it curdles here

14
00:58 --> 00:59
And the crystal is formed

15
01:00 --> 01:05
And how important is that mineral in your life?

16
01:10 --> 01:15
Can you be more specific about the question?

17
01:17 --> 01:21
When did you start working here? Yeah
Did you start small or what?

18
01:22 --> 01:24
Well I said that I have been here for 25 years

19
01:25 --> 01:30
Yes, but could you tell us from what age did you start?
And then how long have you been here?

20
01:31 --> 01:33
I have been working with salt for 25 years.

21
01:38 --> 01:40
And regarding the last question

22
01:42 --> 01:47
About the importance of the salt? Why is it so necessary?
can you tell us

23
01:48 --> 01:54
How do you get to work here?
you can comment us now

24
01:58 --> 02:05
For us, salt is important for food

25
02:12 --> 02:16
To help us with the needs

26
02:22 --> 02:26
And what relationship does it have with the environment?

27
02:27 --> 02:30
With the elements, with the rain, with the sea or with the wind

28
02:33 --> 02:39
The question he asked you is why is salt formed
here and not somewhere else?

29
02:40 --> 02:42
Why precisely here?

30
02:46 --> 02:48
That I don't know

31
02:50 --> 02:54
Here where the salt is, the sun is hot
and there is breeze right? Yeah.

32
02:55 --> 03:01
The sea is salty, but specifically
here it is even saltier

33
03:02 --> 03:08
So since it is saltier here, there is more sun and breeze when the water passes

34
03:09 --> 03:12
It crystallizes, if you tell us more about it

35
03:13 --> 03:15
You can say it in wayuunaiki too

36
03:21 --> 03:28
It is formed by the sun, the water evaporates and the
breeze is drying it

37
03:29 --> 03:37
When it rains you can't process the salt or anything

38
03:38 --> 03:43
But when the sun is very hot we work
more and we earn more

39
04:02 --> 04:10
Can you tell us a bit if this came from your grandparents?
Your interest in salt

40
04:11 --> 04:14
How did you get interested? or how did you learn?

41
04:17 --> 04:23
Who did you learn this from? because there is always one
who learned it first

42
04:24 --> 04:29
Yes, was it the job of your grandparents or your parents?

43
04:30 --> 04:36
Yes, of course it was the job of our parents.
When we were children our parents

44
04:38 --> 04:45
brought us to learn the job and once learned
we started working on our own and then they retired

45
04:52 --> 04:57
Many speak of salt as an energy that has
something more spiritual

46
04:58 --> 05:02
With the wind and all the elements together, right?

47
05:03 --> 05:08
Does that have a spiritual implication for you?
or is that seen in production somehow?

48
05:09 --> 05:11
About this

49
05:13 --> 05:20
University students say that salt has a
spiritual connotation in the sense that

50
05:21 --> 05:24
It is used for spiritual purposes

51
05:25 --> 05:31
That in our culture I don't know since salt is
just for food

52
05:32 --> 05:39
Because it flavors the food. also for sale

53
05:40 --> 05:46
But, our grandparents previously exchanged it.
Yes, they exchanged it with beans, corn

54
05:47 --> 05:49
With food like grains

55
05:50 --> 05:58
Now they sell it for money, to buy clothes
or for the school expenses of our children

56
05:59 --> 06:06
Or we buy our watch, phone or bicycle,
thanks to this job

57
06:19 --> 06:20
OK, thanks a lot.
