1
00:02 --> 00:04
grandpa, tell us about people
Caribbean

2
00:05 --> 00:12
This is our fishing area, right here
We have brought our children

3
00:13 --> 00:15
That's why we've gotten used to this

4
00:16 --> 00:19
And not what the arijunas (those who are not wayuu) work on.

5
00:20 --> 00:24
This has been the profession of our fathers and of
Our grandparents

6
00:25 --> 00:27
This is where they have always fished

7
00:28 --> 00:29
Here

8
00:30 --> 00:36
When there is a lot of wind the breeze pushes the insects
From the mountain to the sea

9
00:37 --> 00:46
So, it's easier to catch the sardines as they say
the arijunas and that is what we eat in summer times.

10
00:47 --> 00:54
Our father Juya (rain) has not arrived here,
Our grandfather

11
00:56 --> 01:01
For this reason, we have lived from fishing
and not what the arijunas work on

12
01:03 --> 01:06
This has been our job.
We don't know what it is to steal

13
01:08 --> 01:11
Because our parents didn't teach us that.

14
01:12 --> 01:16
They only fed us what they caught and it is
What we have learned since then

15
01:18 --> 00:23
One question, what is the wealth of a Caribbean?

16
01:24 --> 01:27
Their wealth is their craft

17
01:28 --> 01:32
What you earn from their job

18
01:33 --> 01:36
Because with that they buy the boat, the cast net

19
01:38 --> 01:43
If he wants to have animals, buy goats and
He has them in another territory

20
01:46 --> 01:52
Far from the sea Thus, his animals are there and he is here.

21
01:54 --> 01:57
This is how things should be

22
01:58 --> 02:02
On that stick over there and the one over there

23
02:03 --> 02:07
animals go straight
there and there

24
02:08 --> 02:15
They do not go beyond that point, but they feed here

25
02:16 --> 02:23
Months or years can go by, the animals always
get to that point in the day

26
02:24 --> 02:33
Even at night, when the
stars come out, that's their sign

27
02:34 --> 02:39
They always know the area where they are going to eat

28
02:41 --> 02:47
They are guided by the sound of the sea to locate themselves in the area

29
02:48 --> 02:50
This is how they do at night

30
02:51 --> 02:54
Another thing I wanted to ask is if

31
02:57 --> 03:01
In summer times there are usually many fish or not?

32
03:02 --> 03:09
No, only at those times of the day when
that there is not so much wind

33
03:10 --> 03:15
There are days when the tides are still and so on.

34
03:17 --> 03:20
And as for the months

35
03:21 --> 03:26
Are there months in which there is an abundance of fish?

36
03:27 --> 03:31
Yes, they last for months because they have their habitat here

37
03:32 --> 03:36
In April there are usually no fish

38
03:38 --> 03:46
Yes, because those who are dedicated to this know the months

39
03:47 --> 03:53
In which there are fish and in which there are none

40
03:54 --> 03:56
where there are no fish

41
03:57 --> 04:01
Yes of course, in April as he says,

42
04:02 --> 04:06
The wind is very good for fishing

43
04:08 --> 04:15
The wind comes from the southwest and pushes the boats there

44
04:16 --> 04:21
Little by little into the sea

45
04:22 --> 04:26
Yes, that’s good, thank you very much, another question

46
04:42 --> 04:50
You know that in our culture everything has
a spiritual connotation

47
04:51 --> 04:58
those of us who live in the mountains when we hunt the
rabbit it is necessary to take into account that there are some spirits

48
04:59 --> 05:05
If we hunt him frequently, those spirits get angry

49
05:06 --> 05:08
Does the same thing happen with the sea?

50
05:09 --> 05:14
Well, they say that when a person fishes
Frequently from the sea many fish appear

51
05:15 --> 05:18
While for others the fish go to the bottom

52
05:19 --> 05:24
It is a spirit that is attracting him,
that's why he gives it only to him

53
05:25 --> 05:27
And then it makes him sick

54
05:28 --> 05:30
It comes in a woman's body

55
05:31 --> 05:38
He tells him "come on, let's go there" and when he is convinced

56
05:39 --> 05:43
He feeds him something to put a spell on him

57
05:44 --> 05:51
And with that he gets used to her.

58
05:52 --> 05:56
I have heard the story of a guy

59
05:57 --> 06:03
That when they see that the waves move too much
they chewed jawapi (medicinal plant)

60
06:04 --> 06:06
Why did they do that?

61
06:07 --> 06:12
No, it's alouka (malambo) it's for it to leave him alone

62
06:13 --> 06:15
so that the spirit is happy

63
06:16 --> 06:22
It is happy if they bring it something, they throw it into the sea

64
06:23 --> 06:27
And you have to ask it to give you fish and that's it.

65
06:28 --> 06:35
It's true, that's the spiritual connotation it has.
That's why you shouldn't rush to fish just for the sake of fishing

66
06:36 --> 06:38
Because if you do, you lose.

67
06:39 --> 06:46
And so it goes, if when moving a goat
is not sacrificed for the arrival

68
06:47 --> 06:50
It can be damaged by a nail or zinc.

69
06:51 --> 06:53
Yes, everything has a ritual

70
06:54 --> 07:00
It has a spiritual connotation, yes.

71
07:01 --> 07:03
To maintain harmony, right?

72
07:04 --> 07:11
Yes of course, to brighten up the territory

73
07:12 --> 07:15
Brighten the Earth.

74
07:16 --> 07:22
If you’re moving, you must do “la comelona” (a big feast)
to harmonize coexistence as well

75
07:41 --> 07:44
Another thing, I mean, another question

76
07:49 --> 07:56
Was there more fish before or is it the same as now?

77
07:57 --> 07:58
no, there are fewer now

78
07:59 --> 08:03
Tell us about it so it's recorded on camera

79
08:04 --> 08:09
There are no longer as many fish as before, that's why there is little fishing now

80
08:10 --> 08:14
If we fish, we return with little

81
08:15 --> 00:21
As it is little, you gain almost nothing with it,
barely enough for food

82
08:22 --> 08:29
Also, there are a lot of people fishing nowadays.

83
08:30 --> 08:38
Also, the new boats with
Johnson motors make a lot of noise

84
08:39 --> 08:42
That noise makes the fish scatter,

85
08:43 --> 08:44
Yes it's correct.
