1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
grandpa, tell us about people
Caribbean

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is our fishing area, right here
We have brought our children

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's why we've gotten used to this

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And not what the arijunas (those who are not wayuu) work on.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This has been the profession of our fathers and of
Our grandparents

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is where they have always fished

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
When there is a lot of wind the breeze pushes the insects
From the mountain to the sea

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So, it's easier to catch the sardines as they say
the arijunas and that is what we eat in summer times.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Our father Juya (rain) has not arrived here,
Our grandfather

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
For this reason, we have lived from fishing
and not what the arijunas work on

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This has been our job.
We don't know what it is to steal

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Because our parents didn't teach us that.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
They only fed us what they caught and it is
What we have learned since then

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
One question, what is the wealth of a Caribbean?

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Their wealth is their craft

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What you earn from their job

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Because with that they buy the boat, the cast net

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If he wants to have animals, buy goats and
He has them in another territory

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Far from the sea Thus, his animals are there and he is here.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is how things should be

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
On that stick over there and the one over there

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
animals go straight
there and there

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
They do not go beyond that point, but they feed here

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Months or years can go by, the animals always
get to that point in the day

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Even at night, when the
stars come out, that's their sign

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
They always know the area where they are going to eat

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
They are guided by the sound of the sea to locate themselves in the area

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is how they do at night

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Another thing I wanted to ask is if

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
In summer times there are usually many fish or not?

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No, only at those times of the day when
that there is not so much wind

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There are days when the tides are still and so on.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And as for the months

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Are there months in which there is an abundance of fish?

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes, they last for months because they have their habitat here

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
In April there are usually no fish

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes, because those who are dedicated to this know the months

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
In which there are fish and in which there are none

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
where there are no fish

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes of course, in April as he says,

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The wind is very good for fishing

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The wind comes from the southwest and pushes the boats there

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Little by little into the sea

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yes, that’s good, thank you very much, another question

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You know that in our culture everything has
a spiritual connotation

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
those of us who live in the mountains when we hunt the
rabbit it is necessary to take into account that there are some spirits

48
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
If we hunt him frequently, those spirits get angry

49
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Does the same thing happen with the sea?

50
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Well, they say that when a person fishes
Frequently from the sea many fish appear

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
While for others the fish go to the bottom

52
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It is a spirit that is attracting him,
that's why he gives it only to him

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And then it makes him sick

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It comes in a woman's body

55
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He tells him "come on, let's go there" and when he is convinced

56
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He feeds him something to put a spell on him

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And with that he gets used to her.

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I have heard the story of a guy

59
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That when they see that the waves move too much
they chewed jawapi (medicinal plant)

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why did they do that?

61
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
No, it's alouka (malambo) it's for it to leave him alone

62
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
so that the spirit is happy

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It is happy if they bring it something, they throw it into the sea

64
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And you have to ask it to give you fish and that's it.

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's true, that's the spiritual connotation it has.
That's why you shouldn't rush to fish just for the sake of fishing

66
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Because if you do, you lose.

67
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And so it goes, if when moving a goat
is not sacrificed for the arrival

68
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It can be damaged by a nail or zinc.

69
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yes, everything has a ritual

70
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It has a spiritual connotation, yes.

71
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
To maintain harmony, right?

72
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes of course, to brighten up the territory

73
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Brighten the Earth.

74
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If you’re moving, you must do “la comelona” (a big feast)
to harmonize coexistence as well

75
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Another thing, I mean, another question

76
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Was there more fish before or is it the same as now?

77
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
no, there are fewer now

78
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Tell us about it so it's recorded on camera

79
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
There are no longer as many fish as before, that's why there is little fishing now

80
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If we fish, we return with little

81
00:08:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
As it is little, you gain almost nothing with it,
barely enough for food

82
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Also, there are a lot of people fishing nowadays.

83
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Also, the new boats with
Johnson motors make a lot of noise

84
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That noise makes the fish scatter,

85
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yes it's correct.
