1
00:00:01,041 --> 00:00:05,000
Sir, can you tell me your name and where you are from?

2
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:07,916
I am. My name is Hamilton Sierra.

3
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:10,041
I'm not from here
but my wife is from here, from Manaure.

4
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:14,166
I am from there on the lower Magdalena coast.

5
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,291
How long have you been working here?

6
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,958
Two years ago,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,833
I'm here just learning the salt.

8
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:22,791
And how have you been learning?

9
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:27,041
Well thank God well, because of this
we live and from this we eat here and

10
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,166
I have done well

11
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:32,000
thank God, I have already learned many things that I did not know about salt.

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,000
What have you learned?

13
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,541
I have learned to collect

14
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:42,166
to load, I did not know, but here I have learned all that here.

15
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,833
Okay.

16
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:50,333
And well, what is the difference in this job
to another job that you have done?

17
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:54,375
The difference may be that this job is heavy for me.

18
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,375
Yes, heavy.

19
00:00:57,416 --> 00:01:00,375
I had never experienced salt, but I experienced it and

20
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:02,708
from here

21
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:05,708
you live from this here, you live from the salt.

22
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,500
Here, well, you don't want the rain to fall

23
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,625
because if it rains,
we won’t have a job, you understand?

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,041
So we need the weather to be, just as it is now,

25
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:19,083
that it´s breezy, that it’s clear, that the sun shines,
the more sun hits and breeze, the better for us.

26
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:22,750
Because since we live from this, then

27
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,125
We need the sun to shine, the breeze to run.

28
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:28,916
Most people want it to rain, right?

29
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:34,166
If most people want it to rain, but then
if it rains we don't have resources to eat,

30
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:37,458
because if we don't take out the salt
We don't have anything to eat either.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,041
And how is it done?

32
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:42,583
How does salt get damaged by rain?

33
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,458
Well... as it is,

34
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,125
if it’s in a part that is dry above, very little is washed,

35
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,875
but if it is inside the pond, since the pond has no outlet, it is washed,

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,666
it dissolves, it melts in a wash, it melts away.

37
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,583
If if rains too hard, I mean, if it doesn’t rain that much

38
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:05,875
it is not consumed.

39
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:09,083
Have you seen that there is a spirituality here as well?

40
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:12,166
related to salt or elements or not?

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,041
No.

42
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,958
And well, this here by the sea too
come the salt, right?

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,291
Yes of course, because that's where they get the water from,
over there there is a little canal, that over there is

44
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:27,125
a canal, that water falls there,

45
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:31,875
from there it takes a week or about fifteen days.

46
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,166
To end up here.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It comes here and from here the salt goes,

48
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,000
it crystallizes here in the ponds

49
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:45,208
with the sun and the breeze. when it's ready

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,625
one comes, puts the shovel in it and if it is thick it is already good to pick it up.

51
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:54,708
One comes to pick up with the owner of
the pond, the water is removed again,

52
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,958
it passes through the pond and collects the salt.

53
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,208
And that, but it comes from..., why is it done like that?

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,625
It's done like this to make it dry, do you understand?

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,208
So that it drains the water.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,250
So one fixes it here and puts it like this?

57
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,333
Yes of course, because one does it like that

58
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:16,708
one piles it up and the higher it is

59
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:20,375
The lower goes the water, do you understand?

60
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,250
Ah okay I didn't know why it was like that

61
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,125
How long does it last like this, what would be ideal?

62
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:29,833
Well, yes, the pond, for example, is exploited
today you can plow tomorrow, you have all day

63
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:33,250
to cover, tomorrow you can load it
like we´re doing right now

64
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,166
Load it onto the cars and they take it away.

65
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,583
So then it's put in the bag?

66
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,166
In the bag and the car comes and we ship the cars.

67
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:46,916
What is your daily earnings through salt work?

68
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:50,708
Well here depending on the cars.

69
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,833
If, for example, if we fill only one car

70
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,166
among ten people,

71
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,583
Let's put $14,000 or $10,000 among us together,

72
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,958
if the salt is from us, that we export it,

73
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:07,541
Well, that’s around $30,000
to each one, daily,

74
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,208
If we have more salt and two cars arrive, three cars,

75
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,708
we have $60,000, $80,000 left, depending on the cars,

76
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,416
because here if a car doesn't arrive there isn't either,
there is no production of anything.

77
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:26,541
Who are the ones from the cars?

78
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:30,041
Well, the owners of the ponds command the cars,

79
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:34,208
They say “go to that part, that there is a car over there”

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,791
and one loads it.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,541
because one here has the salt,
but if they don't arrive we don't have either

82
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:44,625
nothing.

83
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,208
What knowledge do you have of salt, what is it used for?

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,791
Well, salt is used for many things, for livestock, for eating,

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,333
for many things that …

86
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,708
salt is very important

87
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,500
because if it wasn’t for the salt you couldn’t,

88
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:05,708
You can't make some rice, you can't do something because salt is irreplaceable.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,791
Basis of life?

90
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:11,125
Yes, a base that... for example you,

91
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,125
with sugar, if you’re going to make some juice

92
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,291
You can put some cane sugar or something, but you can’t do that with salt,

93
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,083
You can't season rice, you can't add brown sugar,

94
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,041
you can't put anything on it.

95
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:25,750
So this is a point
which is important to us here in Manaure.

96
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:29,708
I'm not from here, but it's important
because this is where I get the food from

97
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,833
Daily, every day

98
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,583
From 4 in the morning sometimes 3,
depending on the cars,

99
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:42,166
if they arrive early at 5 in the morning or arrive at 3,
at that time you have to stop

100
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,583
to pack the salt

101
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,250
and until ten?

102
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,416
Until ten in the morning and sometimes they take until eleven,

103
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,333
sometimes even until noon,
because they come and go from here to

104
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:54,916
Uribia,

105
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,333
So it takes until that, that they come here.

106
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:03,833
Does it also have to do with the sun,
that is very, very strong?

107
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:08,083
Yes, it affects us a lot
when it’s around this time, eleven o'clock

108
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,166
and a car parks, sometimes you even vomit,

109
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,041
Or faint because of the very strong sun.

110
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,083
But you know, you do that for…

111
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,666
because one must do it, because

112
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:25,083
the food comes from there.
