1
00:00:01:01 --> 00:00:04:24
Sir, can you tell me your name and where you are from?

2
00:00:04:25 --> 00:00:07:22
I am. My name is Hamilton Sierra.

3
00:00:07:23 --> 00:00:10:01
I'm not from here
but my wife is from here, from Manaure.

4
00:00:10:11 --> 00:00:13:28
I am from there on the lower Magdalena coast.

5
00:00:13:29 --> 00:00:15:07
How long have you been working here?

6
00:00:15:15 --> 00:00:17:23
Two years ago,

7
00:00:17:24 --> 00:00:20:20
I'm here just learning the salt.

8
00:00:21:02 --> 00:00:22:19
And how have you been learning?

9
00:00:22:20 --> 00:00:26:25
Well thank God well, because of this
we live and from this we eat here and

10
00:00:27:25 --> 00:00:29:04
I have done well

11
00:00:29:04 --> 00:00:31:24
thank God, I have already learned many things that I did not know about salt.

12
00:00:33:06 --> 00:00:35:00
What have you learned?

13
00:00:35:01 --> 00:00:37:13
I have learned to collect

14
00:00:38:08 --> 00:00:41:28
to load, I did not know, but here I have learned all that here.

15
00:00:42:14 --> 00:00:44:20
Okay.

16
00:00:45:14 --> 00:00:50:08
And well, what is the difference in this job
to another job that you have done?

17
00:00:50:26 --> 00:00:54:09
The difference may be that this job is heavy for me.

18
00:00:55:01 --> 00:00:57:09
Yes, heavy.

19
00:00:57:10 --> 00:01:00:09
I had never experienced salt, but I experienced it and

20
00:01:01:15 --> 00:01:02:17
from here

21
00:01:02:17 --> 00:01:05:17
you live from this here, you live from the salt.

22
00:01:05:18 --> 00:01:08:12
Here, well, you don't want the rain to fall

23
00:01:08:13 --> 00:01:11:15
because if it rains,
we won’t have a job, you understand?

24
00:01:12:00 --> 00:01:14:01
So we need the weather to be, just as it is now,

25
00:01:14:19 --> 00:01:18:26
that it´s breezy, that it’s clear, that the sun shines,
the more sun hits and breeze, the better for us.

26
00:01:18:27 --> 00:01:22:18
Because since we live from this, then

27
00:01:22:19 --> 00:01:24:27
We need the sun to shine, the breeze to run.

28
00:01:25:19 --> 00:01:28:22
Most people want it to rain, right?

29
00:01:29:08 --> 00:01:34:04
If most people want it to rain, but then
if it rains we don't have resources to eat,

30
00:01:34:07 --> 00:01:37:11
because if we don't take out the salt
We don't have anything to eat either.

31
00:01:37:24 --> 00:01:39:01
And how is it done?

32
00:01:39:02 --> 00:01:42:14
How does salt get damaged by rain?

33
00:01:42:15 --> 00:01:44:11
Well... as it is,

34
00:01:44:12 --> 00:01:47:27
if it’s in a part that is dry above, very little is washed,

35
00:01:48:06 --> 00:01:52:21
but if it is inside the pond, since the pond has no outlet, it is washed,

36
00:01:54:00 --> 00:01:56:16
it dissolves, it melts in a wash, it melts away.

37
00:01:58:03 --> 00:02:00:14
If if rains too hard, I mean, if it doesn’t rain that much

38
00:02:01:04 --> 00:02:05:21
it is not consumed.

39
00:02:05:26 --> 00:02:09:02
Have you seen that there is a spirituality here as well?

40
00:02:09:10 --> 00:02:11:28
related to salt or elements or not?

41
00:02:13:00 --> 00:02:15:25
No.

42
00:02:16:12 --> 00:02:19:23
And well, this here by the sea too
come the salt, right?

43
00:02:19:24 --> 00:02:24:07
Yes of course, because that's where they get the water from,
over there there is a little canal, that over there is

44
00:02:24:08 --> 00:02:27:03
a canal, that water falls there,

45
00:02:28:05 --> 00:02:31:21
from there it takes a week or about fifteen days.

46
00:02:31:22 --> 00:02:33:28
To end up here.

47
00:02:35:00 --> 00:02:37:00
It comes here and from here the salt goes,

48
00:02:38:06 --> 00:02:41:00
it crystallizes here in the ponds

49
00:02:41:13 --> 00:02:44:29
with the sun and the breeze. when it's ready

50
00:02:45:00 --> 00:02:49:15
one comes, puts the shovel in it and if it is thick it is already good to pick it up.

51
00:02:49:27 --> 00:02:54:17
One comes to pick up with the owner of
the pond, the water is removed again,

52
00:02:55:07 --> 00:02:57:23
it passes through the pond and collects the salt.

53
00:02:58:25 --> 00:03:00:29
And that, but it comes from..., why is it done like that?

54
00:03:01:00 --> 00:03:03:15
It's done like this to make it dry, do you understand?

55
00:03:04:24 --> 00:03:07:29
So that it drains the water.

56
00:03:08:00 --> 00:03:09:06
So one fixes it here and puts it like this?

57
00:03:10:15 --> 00:03:12:08
Yes of course, because one does it like that

58
00:03:12:08 --> 00:03:16:17
one piles it up and the higher it is

59
00:03:17:03 --> 00:03:20:09
The lower goes the water, do you understand?

60
00:03:20:10 --> 00:03:22:06
Ah okay I didn't know why it was like that

61
00:03:22:15 --> 00:03:24:03
How long does it last like this, what would be ideal?

62
00:03:24:03 --> 00:03:29:20
Well, yes, the pond, for example, is exploited
today you can plow tomorrow, you have all day

63
00:03:29:21 --> 00:03:33:06
to cover, tomorrow you can load it
like we´re doing right now

64
00:03:33:29 --> 00:03:35:28
Load it onto the cars and they take it away.

65
00:03:36:12 --> 00:03:38:14
So then it's put in the bag?

66
00:03:38:15 --> 00:03:40:28
In the bag and the car comes and we ship the cars.

67
00:03:42:01 --> 00:03:46:22
What is your daily earnings through salt work?

68
00:03:46:23 --> 00:03:50:17
Well here depending on the cars.

69
00:03:51:07 --> 00:03:53:20
If, for example, if we fill only one car

70
00:03:53:21 --> 00:03:56:04
among ten people,

71
00:03:56:22 --> 00:03:59:14
Let's put $14,000 or $10,000 among us together,

72
00:04:00:27 --> 00:04:03:23
if the salt is from us, that we export it,

73
00:04:04:04 --> 00:04:07:13
Well, that’s around $30,000
to each one, daily,

74
00:04:08:26 --> 00:04:12:05
If we have more salt and two cars arrive, three cars,

75
00:04:12:06 --> 00:04:17:17
we have $60,000, $80,000 left, depending on the cars,

76
00:04:18:06 --> 00:04:23:10
because here if a car doesn't arrive there isn't either,
there is no production of anything.

77
00:04:23:11 --> 00:04:26:13
Who are the ones from the cars?

78
00:04:26:14 --> 00:04:30:01
Well, the owners of the ponds command the cars,

79
00:04:30:21 --> 00:04:33:29
They say “go to that part, that there is a car over there”

80
00:04:34:00 --> 00:04:35:19
and one loads it.

81
00:04:36:00 --> 00:04:39:13
because one here has the salt,
but if they don't arrive we don't have either

82
00:04:40:08 --> 00:04:44:15
nothing.

83
00:04:44:16 --> 00:04:46:29
What knowledge do you have of salt, what is it used for?

84
00:04:47:00 --> 00:04:50:19
Well, salt is used for many things, for livestock, for eating,

85
00:04:51:24 --> 00:04:54:08
for many things that …

86
00:04:55:26 --> 00:04:57:17
salt is very important

87
00:04:57:25 --> 00:05:00:12
because if it wasn’t for the salt you couldn’t,

88
00:05:00:21 --> 00:05:05:17
You can't make some rice, you can't do something because salt is irreplaceable.

89
00:05:06:24 --> 00:05:07:19
Basis of life?

90
00:05:07:20 --> 00:05:10:27
Yes, a base that... for example you,

91
00:05:12:01 --> 00:05:14:03
with sugar, if you’re going to make some juice

92
00:05:14:04 --> 00:05:17:07
You can put some cane sugar or something, but you can’t do that with salt,

93
00:05:19:02 --> 00:05:20:02
You can't season rice, you can't add brown sugar,

94
00:05:20:02 --> 00:05:22:01
you can't put anything on it.

95
00:05:22:05 --> 00:05:25:18
So this is a point
which is important to us here in Manaure.

96
00:05:25:19 --> 00:05:29:17
I'm not from here, but it's important
because this is where I get the food from

97
00:05:31:11 --> 00:05:33:20
Daily, every day

98
00:05:33:21 --> 00:05:37:14
From 4 in the morning sometimes 3,
depending on the cars,

99
00:05:37:15 --> 00:05:41:28
if they arrive early at 5 in the morning or arrive at 3,
at that time you have to stop

100
00:05:41:29 --> 00:05:43:14
to pack the salt

101
00:05:44:27 --> 00:05:47:06
and until ten?

102
00:05:47:07 --> 00:05:50:10
Until ten in the morning and sometimes they take until eleven,

103
00:05:50:25 --> 00:05:54:08
sometimes even until noon,
because they come and go from here to

104
00:05:54:15 --> 00:05:54:22
Uribia,

105
00:05:55:28 --> 00:05:58:08
So it takes until that, that they come here.

106
00:05:59:17 --> 00:06:03:20
Does it also have to do with the sun,
that is very, very strong?

107
00:06:03:21 --> 00:06:07:26
Yes, it affects us a lot
when it’s around this time, eleven o'clock

108
00:06:08:12 --> 00:06:11:28
and a car parks, sometimes you even vomit,

109
00:06:12:11 --> 00:06:14:25
Or faint because of the very strong sun.

110
00:06:15:25 --> 00:06:17:26
But you know, you do that for…

111
00:06:17:27 --> 00:06:20:16
because one must do it, because

112
00:06:21:17 --> 00:06:24:26
the food comes from there.
