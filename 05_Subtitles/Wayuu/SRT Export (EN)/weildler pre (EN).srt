1
00:00:04:12 --> 00:00:06:12
What I wanted to say about the land

2
00:00:06:13 --> 00:00:07:28
Mma in the case of the Wayú,

3
00:00:07:28 --> 00:00:09:29
is that without a doubt she is

4
00:00:11:10 --> 00:00:13:27
the mother of living beings,

5
00:00:13:28 --> 00:00:17:22
of some of them, those who are over it,
because there are other beings like the stars.

6
00:00:18:10 --> 00:00:19:09
and other beings

7
00:00:19:10 --> 00:00:20:20
that are not from her, the sea itself

8
00:00:20:20 --> 00:00:24:12
It's not her, it's a sister.

9
00:00:24:13 --> 00:00:28:23
In the Wayú conception,
she has a capacity of transformation

10
00:00:28:24 --> 00:00:32:05
of beings, because the Earth is mysterious

11
00:00:33:14 --> 00:00:38:02
and when she is mysterious, we do not know her will

12
00:00:38:03 --> 00:00:42:27
to transform or to change, transform
what’s on it.

13
00:00:42:28 --> 00:00:46:21
And humans are part of that,
but also the animals, the plants.

14
00:00:47:15 --> 00:00:50:13
So the Wayuú have that notion
of the mysteriousness of the earth.

15
00:00:51:12 --> 00:00:53:25
Sometimes it's reckless,

16
00:00:53:26 --> 00:00:57:28
sometimes it's reckless,

17
00:00:57:29 --> 00:01:01:08
curious, confused, curious

18
00:01:03:18 --> 00:01:05:19
and unpredictable, and

19
00:01:07:00 --> 00:01:08:06
There are times when

20
00:01:08:06 --> 00:01:11:24
faints like a woman, lifeless,

21
00:01:12:08 --> 00:01:15:21
In the summer, in the drought, the earth faints.

22
00:01:16:10 --> 00:01:19:28
Then Lluvia (rain), which is a
being masculine, hyper masculine,

23
00:01:21:18 --> 00:01:23:26
appears and it rains.

24
00:01:24:22 --> 00:01:26:28
that rain

25
00:01:27:01 --> 00:01:29:24
Wakes her up from her fainting

26
00:01:30:12 --> 00:01:34:07
And she explodes all her vitality.

27
00:01:34:08 --> 00:01:37:17
The trees shed leaves, flowers, fruits.

28
00:01:37:24 --> 00:01:40:03
Animals reproduce

29
00:01:40:05 --> 00:01:41:11
humans also

30
00:01:41:11 --> 00:01:43:03
reproduce and their

31
00:01:43:03 --> 00:01:45:12
living conditions are greater,

32
00:01:45:28 --> 00:01:48:22
They are better because today

33
00:01:48:23 --> 00:01:50:22
everything is abundant.

34
00:01:51:05 --> 00:01:53:29
So there

35
00:01:54:00 --> 00:01:56:15
we have to see the earth, separating it

36
00:01:56:16 --> 00:01:59:29
a bit of the stereotype that has been created

37
00:02:01:02 --> 00:02:05:18
sometimes from environmentalist sectors,
sometimes in indigenous peoples themselves

38
00:02:05:19 --> 00:02:09:19
who have also idealized that and

39
00:02:11:11 --> 00:02:14:00
something starts forming

40
00:02:14:01 --> 00:02:16:01
something we have called global neo-shamanism,

41
00:02:17:12 --> 00:02:21:19
which is sometimes an idealization
of indigenous peoples and sometimes

42
00:02:21:20 --> 00:02:27:04
we erase borders, as if all indigenous
people think the same and they do not think the same.

43
00:02:27:23 --> 00:02:30:10
Only here, in La Guajira, a few

44
00:02:30:11 --> 00:02:33:04
kilometers, there are the iwa, the Kogi.

45
00:02:33:14 --> 00:02:34:23
and the wayuú

46
00:02:34:23 --> 00:02:36:26
They are here at a few kilometers from them.

47
00:02:37:12 --> 00:02:41:10
They both have completely different cosmologies.

48
00:02:41:11 --> 00:02:44:29
And within the Wayú themselves there are also,
Is it different or more or less?

49
00:02:45:19 --> 00:02:49:29
They share it, only there are geo-environmental nuances,

50
00:02:50:00 --> 00:02:53:16
For example,
the stories among the peoples of the sea

51
00:02:54:06 --> 00:02:57:20
They emphasize marine elements,
for the sea, the

52
00:02:57:21 --> 00:02:59:09
fisherman,

53
00:02:59:10 --> 00:03:03:04
pastors tend to have that,
but it is the same, that is, they have elements.

54
00:03:03:05 --> 00:03:07:23
What happens there is a beautiful concept,
who was attributed by

55
00:03:07:24 --> 00:03:12:22
an American psychologist,
They are called dogmatic neighborhoods.

56
00:03:13:21 --> 00:03:15:29
It means that the knowledge

57
00:03:16:00 --> 00:03:18:19
is not universal, it is distributed in neighborhoods.

58
00:03:19:08 --> 00:03:22:20
The same myth can have its variation if it is
collected

59
00:03:22:21 --> 00:03:26:15
inside the territory
that if you pick it up on the seashore, where the fishermen

60
00:03:27:14 --> 00:03:28:04
are going to add

61
00:03:28:04 --> 00:03:32:16
a very marine environment,

62
00:03:32:18 --> 00:03:37:11
and that allows us to see
how these narratives have their variations.

63
00:03:37:12 --> 00:03:40:11
That kind of things.

64
00:03:40:26 --> 00:03:45:01
So for me it is key
then put as emphasis

65
00:03:45:02 --> 00:03:48:10
that, that, first,

66
00:03:48:11 --> 00:03:51:23
indigenous peoples have cosmologies
differentiated.

67
00:03:51:24 --> 00:03:54:09
Some peoples have cosmogonies

68
00:03:55:02 --> 00:03:57:24
and others have cosmologies

69
00:03:57:25 --> 00:03:59:24
and the difference is key.

70
00:03:59:25 --> 00:04:03:08
Those who are interested in
the origin of the universe,

71
00:04:03:09 --> 00:04:06:16
in the creation stories of the universe,
They one type of people.

72
00:04:08:00 --> 00:04:12:07
The Greeks were very interested
in cosmogonies.

73
00:04:12:08 --> 00:04:16:01
The Theogony of Sidon is the story of the gods
and how the world was formed

74
00:04:16:02 --> 00:04:18:19
and makes a genealogy of the gods.

75
00:04:19:04 --> 00:04:23:19
In the Wayuú world
is more cosmological, they are more curious

76
00:04:23:20 --> 00:04:29:03
About the transformation of the universe,
for the modeling of the universe than for its creation.

77
00:04:29:17 --> 00:04:31:26
Yes, there are creation narratives.

78
00:04:31:27 --> 00:04:34:25
There may be, but it is not an oral set.

79
00:04:34:26 --> 00:04:37:00
When one examines hundreds of myths,

80
00:04:37:25 --> 00:04:41:16
one begins to find that the emphasis and everything is
in the transformative.

81
00:04:41:17 --> 00:04:44:07
In fact, they have notions of transformative times

82
00:04:44:25 --> 00:04:49:08
and they are very interested if their narratives
are about how the universe transforms.

83
00:04:49:26 --> 00:04:52:01
That is the big concern.

84
00:04:52:02 --> 00:04:55:13
So the explanation
that they give to the world, including the Earth,

85
00:04:57:00 --> 00:05:00:08
is that

86
00:05:00:09 --> 00:05:05:11
the world has two elements
the physical element, which is the appearance of beings,

87
00:05:05:12 --> 00:05:06:01
morphology.

88
00:05:06:01 --> 00:05:09:24
That banana that is there, for example, he
has an appearance

89
00:05:09:25 --> 00:05:14:18
that we are seeing, but they have an interior element,
an interiority

90
00:05:15:02 --> 00:05:19:19
that lives within physicality,
which is the capacity

91
00:05:19:20 --> 00:05:22:26
the ability to see the universe, to have

92
00:05:22:27 --> 00:05:25:06
a point of view on the universe

93
00:05:25:28 --> 00:05:27:29
and to act in the universe.

94
00:05:29:22 --> 00:05:32:20
Much of Western thought,
which is also derived from the Greeks,

95
00:05:33:17 --> 00:05:37:21
sees some beings as a backdrop.

96
00:05:38:07 --> 00:05:40:22
Like... like Aristotle said,

97
00:05:42:00 --> 00:05:44:16
He considered plants to be the least

98
00:05:44:17 --> 00:05:49:29
who lack intellect
and emotions,

99
00:05:50:00 --> 00:05:53:25
there are humans,
then the animals, in the Wayuú world it is the other way around.

100
00:05:54:12 --> 00:05:56:06
Plants are naturally wise beings

101
00:05:57:24 --> 00:05:58:16
They

102
00:05:58:16 --> 00:06:00:25
They are the wise ones and then the animals and

103
00:06:00:26 --> 00:06:02:11
then the humans.

104
00:06:02:12 --> 00:06:05:03
That they are the dumbest in the universe.

105
00:06:05:28 --> 00:06:10:27
Why are plants wiser? They are wiser

106
00:06:10:28 --> 00:06:15:16
because they were humans in the past
that were transformed.

107
00:06:16:11 --> 00:06:17:27
Everyone was human.

108
00:06:17:28 --> 00:06:19:11
The entire universe was human.

109
00:06:19:11 --> 00:06:24:14
The stars, the winds,
the animals, everything was human.

110
00:06:25:11 --> 00:06:27:21
And suddenly, by Mma,

111
00:06:27:22 --> 00:06:31:19
the Earth, which is mysterious,
because he fought with Palaa,

112
00:06:33:01 --> 00:06:35:11
because there were floods from

113
00:06:35:12 --> 00:06:38:12
that Palaa, the sea, invaded the Earth

114
00:06:40:04 --> 00:06:42:00
his sister, they fight.

115
00:06:42:01 --> 00:06:44:18
Because there are beings that transform.

116
00:06:44:22 --> 00:06:48:18
When someone breaks a rule,
the very violent like a jaguar,

117
00:06:48:19 --> 00:06:52:22
a human was turned into a jaguar for his desire
for violence,

118
00:06:52:23 --> 00:06:57:03
the war, the blood. The crows,

119
00:06:57:04 --> 00:06:59:21
the carrion birds that were

120
00:07:00:12 --> 00:07:04:21
Wayuú shepherds who liked meat,
They ate the entire flock,

121
00:07:05:00 --> 00:07:08:01
then they ate any dead animal
that they found,

122
00:07:08:14 --> 00:07:12:23
They were uncontrollable
their obsession with meat were transformed

123
00:07:12:24 --> 00:07:16:25
in the buzzards, in the crows that we see today
who eat rotten meat.

124
00:07:17:18 --> 00:07:20:06
The snake, the rabbit, because it was very sad,

125
00:07:21:08 --> 00:07:24:08
He was mischievous and they transformed him. Anyway,

126
00:07:24:10 --> 00:07:27:28
then all those stories of the Wayuú
They show us the transformation,

127
00:07:28:19 --> 00:07:31:06
but from the transformation we move to the current world.

128
00:07:31:27 --> 00:07:34:21
The world as we see it today,

129
00:07:34:22 --> 00:07:36:28
then the plants

130
00:07:37:25 --> 00:07:42:01
When they transformed from being humans,
that their arms turned into leaves,

131
00:07:42:02 --> 00:07:47:18
their legs in stems and in roots,
They stayed in the place where they were assigned.

132
00:07:49:07 --> 00:07:50:24
They are peaceful,

133
00:07:50:25 --> 00:07:53:25
They don't attack anyone, they don't mess with anyone.

134
00:07:54:16 --> 00:07:56:23
This doesn't happen to animals or humans.

135
00:07:57:06 --> 00:08:01:00
So, that desire for pacifism,

136
00:08:01:22 --> 00:08:05:02
that ability to stay in the place that suits you
was assigned,

137
00:08:05:03 --> 00:08:08:03
Well, in these cosmological notions
the world has an order,

138
00:08:08:23 --> 00:08:11:08
the world has an order,

139
00:08:11:16 --> 00:08:13:17
Even the rain has an order.

140
00:08:13:18 --> 00:08:16:28
The rain must water in an way
and the intensity of its fall

141
00:08:16:29 --> 00:08:20:11
must be gradual,
and then all that is an order.

142
00:08:21:15 --> 00:08:23:22
For this reason they are considered the wisest beings

143
00:08:24:09 --> 00:08:25:24
that is in nature.

144
00:08:25:24 --> 00:08:28:11
And when the Wayú fight for land,

145
00:08:29:07 --> 00:08:33:04
displaced persons, for example, violence,
the Wayuú tell him

146
00:08:33:05 --> 00:08:37:06
you have to be like the plants
that they do not dispute the lands with anyone.

147
00:08:37:07 --> 00:08:40:09
They stayed in the place they told them,
this is your place and from there

148
00:08:41:13 --> 00:08:43:09
They live and

149
00:08:43:10 --> 00:08:44:14
there are.

150
00:08:44:15 --> 00:08:49:12
But the plant also preserves
a residual humanity that dwells within her.

151
00:08:50:01 --> 00:08:53:08
That past, not that past
but that transhistorical time,

152
00:08:53:09 --> 00:08:56:24
because it is not a notion of the past,
present and future

153
00:08:56:25 --> 00:08:58:27
as in the West,

154
00:08:58:28 --> 00:09:02:20
that linear vision,
It is a vision of discontinuous time

155
00:09:03:01 --> 00:09:07:23
and other complex shocks of time,
which is not cyclical time.

156
00:09:08:04 --> 00:09:12:16
No, that's linear time that goes around,
It's the same linear time, but it goes around.

157
00:09:12:29 --> 00:09:16:02
These are discontinuous times,

158
00:09:17:07 --> 00:09:19:27
times that may be ahead,

159
00:09:19:28 --> 00:09:23:25
times that can be parallel
with everyday time

160
00:09:23:26 --> 00:09:28:29
and times that are referential, that tell us
we must refer to the order

161
00:09:29:22 --> 00:09:31:09
of this time

162
00:09:32:01 --> 00:09:33:08
that is there.

163
00:09:34:06 --> 00:09:36:22
So with the dream,

164
00:09:37:20 --> 00:09:40:00
the ritual, the landscape,

165
00:09:41:00 --> 00:09:43:08
that time is accessible to the current time,

166
00:09:45:16 --> 00:09:48:24
for the stories, for the history, for the visual.

167
00:09:49:16 --> 00:09:53:06
So every tree, every plant has that
and the animals too.

168
00:09:53:25 --> 00:09:57:25
In fact, it is believed that they had knowledge,
They practiced their trade.

169
00:09:58:24 --> 00:10:03:06
The spider wove and taught humans
to knit, to women.

170
00:10:03:22 --> 00:10:05:18
The jaguar knew how to wage war,

171
00:10:05:18 --> 00:10:09:14
we know the war for them.

172
00:10:09:15 --> 00:10:13:02
Corn was a farmer, just like the bean,

173
00:10:13:09 --> 00:10:15:11
We learn agriculture from them.

174
00:10:16:02 --> 00:10:19:13
Music came to us from animals or trees,

175
00:10:19:20 --> 00:10:23:29
like the flute from which we get the wood.

176
00:10:24:00 --> 00:10:28:01
In short, jobs and human institutions
They are a legacy,

177
00:10:28:29 --> 00:10:31:17
a legacy, from other living beings,

178
00:10:32:02 --> 00:10:35:25
most of which are not human,
They are not human.

179
00:10:47:06 --> 00:10:49:03
So,

180
00:10:49:27 --> 00:10:51:12
let's say for

181
00:10:51:13 --> 00:10:57:00
To explain it this way, they are notions of the Wayuú world
that have to do with the role of the Earth

182
00:10:57:11 --> 00:10:58:24
like a being,

183
00:10:58:25 --> 00:11:02:15
a maternal, feminine, large being, who somehow

184
00:11:02:16 --> 00:11:07:15
She is the mother of us all,
but that sometimes arises in a stereotype.

185
00:11:07:16 --> 00:11:09:18
like that being

186
00:11:09:19 --> 00:11:12:08
wise, infallible, pure.

187
00:11:12:17 --> 00:11:16:11
No, she is a being with generous traits,

188
00:11:16:12 --> 00:11:21:29
fertile, gives life, but mysterious and reckless.

189
00:11:22:00 --> 00:11:25:22
May fall into disputes.
When the Wayuú see climate change

190
00:11:26:04 --> 00:11:29:07
and when the Wayuú talk about coastal erosion

191
00:11:29:08 --> 00:11:33:04
and all this warming, they see it as wars,

192
00:11:33:25 --> 00:11:37:08
tensions between Palaa and Mma, the Earth.

193
00:11:38:26 --> 00:11:40:10
They keep those tensions and

194
00:11:40:11 --> 00:11:43:18
those tensions that are in time.

195
00:11:44:12 --> 00:11:48:04
It’s not like it just happened and the collapse comes,

196
00:11:48:22 --> 00:11:51:05
The world is going to end for the first time.

197
00:11:51:07 --> 00:11:53:12
No, they say, that's old,

198
00:11:54:09 --> 00:11:58:27
we know that they have tensions
and that there may be times when

199
00:12:00:06 --> 00:12:01:16
Palaa invades

200
00:12:01:17 --> 00:12:06:23
and they show us the snails, the shells
that are inside the Earth and the Sea is far away

201
00:12:06:24 --> 00:12:09:13
and says look, this is proof that Mma,

202
00:12:10:00 --> 00:12:12:26
that the sea had invaded the land
so long ago.

203
00:12:14:05 --> 00:12:16:08
Yeah.

204
00:12:16:10 --> 00:12:29:12
So, well, that's how to introduce

205
00:12:29:13 --> 00:12:33:01
what we can talk about,
to give you a vision.

206
00:12:33:26 --> 00:12:35:08
Yes.

207
00:12:35:08 --> 00:12:37:15
Original of all this town

208
00:12:37:26 --> 00:12:38:16
Well,

209
00:12:39:08 --> 00:12:40:22
many of the things you have said,

210
00:12:40:22 --> 00:12:42:02
that's true.

211
00:12:42:03 --> 00:12:45:17
and I have been living in Peru,

212
00:12:45:18 --> 00:12:50:01
and I was noticing a lot about people
there, friends that I was making.

213
00:12:51:00 --> 00:12:53:17
they had a different relationship with the Earth.

214
00:12:53:18 --> 00:12:54:10
Clear.

215
00:12:54:14 --> 00:12:58:02
And all the moon, the sun.

216
00:12:58:12 --> 00:13:02:03
A relationship between a human,

217
00:13:02:04 --> 00:13:06:07
a spiritual being and what I wanted to capture

218
00:13:07:11 --> 00:13:08:18
was in

219
00:13:08:19 --> 00:13:12:26
the minds of city people
or Western culture.

220
00:13:13:25 --> 00:13:17:19
It was that basically

we are killing our mother a little

221
00:13:17:25 --> 00:13:24:00
This is how we can fight that
or how can we stop that in a way

222
00:13:24:06 --> 00:13:27:11
is to show intimate relationships with the earth

223
00:13:27:23 --> 00:13:30:07
or with nature, for example,

224
00:13:30:14 --> 00:13:33:00
because as you are saying, many

225
00:13:33:10 --> 00:13:36:14
indigenous, many are not, there is no separation, right?

226
00:13:37:03 --> 00:13:39:22
And then what we did there

227
00:13:40:14 --> 00:13:43:20
and what we want to do
Here they are two different things.

228
00:13:43:21 --> 00:13:46:01
And I was telling them something about that and

229
00:13:46:02 --> 00:13:51:25
is that first of all we want to expose

230
00:13:52:27 --> 00:13:55:21
the territory,

231
00:13:55:22 --> 00:13:59:29
physical things, like the wind, the hills.

232
00:14:00:02 --> 00:14:01:18
Yes, the hills are brutal. They are brutal

233
00:14:01:19 --> 00:14:05:01
Yes, but as a main character

234
00:14:06:09 --> 00:14:07:14
of the story.

235
00:14:07:14 --> 00:14:12:27
So what we are doing is a documentary
from a series of like six places in Colombia.

236
00:14:12:28 --> 00:14:17:26
Now and in each of them
We want to focus first on the territory,

237
00:14:17:27 --> 00:14:20:20
because as you are saying, that territory

238
00:14:21:11 --> 00:14:25:03
has a different relevance for each group

239
00:14:25:06 --> 00:14:27:27
and then we want to show

240
00:14:28:16 --> 00:14:31:14
the territory as it is alive and we are

241
00:14:31:25 --> 00:14:35:15
from what we have read from you and others
is that here it is the wind.

242
00:14:35:16 --> 00:14:39:21
It's like one of the (…)
which is vital and also

243
00:14:40:11 --> 00:14:42:20
speaking as a filmmaker the best

244
00:14:43:01 --> 00:14:46:18
to show because they have an agency, right?

245
00:14:46:19 --> 00:14:47:21
One can see it.

246
00:14:47:21 --> 00:14:51:21
And there are several, in plural,
It is not just one, it is many winds.

247
00:14:51:22 --> 00:14:54:01
Well, let me see if I can bring you here,

248
00:14:54:02 --> 00:14:57:11
I have something I published
in a Mexican magazine about winds.

249
00:14:57:23 --> 00:15:08:09
Cool.

250
00:15:08:10 --> 00:15:28:01
Wilder Guerra.
Yeah,

251
00:15:29:05 --> 00:15:30:05
that's all.

252
00:15:30:06 --> 00:15:31:10
Of course it is in Spanish.

253
00:15:34:16 --> 00:15:36:09
So,

254
00:15:37:24 --> 00:15:41:21
It is called “At the mercy of the winds”.

255
00:15:41:22 --> 00:15:43:09
Talks a little about the relationship between men and

256
00:15:43:10 --> 00:15:44:28
It is also published in

257
00:15:44:29 --> 00:15:47:02
Internet.

258
00:15:47:14 --> 00:15:48:19
I don't know if I read

259
00:15:48:19 --> 00:15:52:14
everything, but yes.

260
00:15:52:15 --> 00:15:59:25
Yes, at the mercy of the winds.

261
00:15:59:26 --> 00:16:04:15
It's about I guess each of the winds

262
00:16:04:16 --> 00:16:07:22
also has their different character.

263
00:16:07:23 --> 00:16:11:27
their mood, each one their temperament.

264
00:16:12:25 --> 00:16:15:01
Some are beneficial, others

265
00:16:15:02 --> 00:16:18:11
They bring hunger, drought, others...

266
00:16:18:12 --> 00:16:21:02
Yes, that will vary.

267
00:16:21:03 --> 00:16:22:06
Yes, yes.

268
00:16:40:13 --> 00:16:41:26
Well, there's so much to talk about, right?

269
00:16:41:27 --> 00:16:43:03
Yeah.

270
00:16:43:07 --> 00:16:44:04
There's a lot

271
00:16:44:05 --> 00:16:50:11
and I love that of the territory, because
the territory is like a book, the territory

272
00:16:50:12 --> 00:16:53:17
speaks, the territory just with its landscape

273
00:16:53:18 --> 00:16:57:05
He's talking, he's saying,

274
00:16:57:06 --> 00:16:59:03
things and...

275
00:16:59:04 --> 00:17:01:09
and the hills,

276
00:17:01:10 --> 00:17:04:18
each hill has a meaning, it is not there

277
00:17:04:19 --> 00:17:07:23
capriciously, it is not part of a promontory.

278
00:17:08:24 --> 00:17:12:05
In fact, the Wayuú share with the Australians,

279
00:17:12:06 --> 00:17:15:01
with the Australian aborigines, the idea that

280
00:17:16:16 --> 00:17:19:05
life is somewhat part of the intention of the place.

281
00:17:20:11 --> 00:17:22:21
A product not just of the land, but

282
00:17:23:02 --> 00:17:25:29
the place, the specific place.

283
00:17:26:26 --> 00:17:31:08
And there are some places that are called, and that are

284
00:17:32:17 --> 00:17:35:11
the holes like the vaginas of the earth

285
00:17:35:12 --> 00:17:37:26
by which a lineage, not all humans,

286
00:17:38:12 --> 00:17:41:26
a specific human lineage came into the world.

287
00:17:41:27 --> 00:17:43:14
It emerged into the world.

288
00:17:43:17 --> 00:17:47:21
These are called territorial roots,
as heads of the territory.

289
00:17:47:22 --> 00:17:50:23
And each Wayuú lineage has one in the

290
00:17:50:24 --> 00:17:51:14
upper Guajira,

291
00:17:51:14 --> 00:17:54:10
They are water holes or water depressions,

292
00:17:54:26 --> 00:17:58:16
through which it came out, emerged from the Earth,

293
00:17:59:02 --> 00:17:59:20
the world.

294
00:18:01:18 --> 00:18:02:28
And that is very important in the

295
00:18:02:28 --> 00:18:04:21
Wayuú territoriality.

296
00:18:04:22 --> 00:18:07:03
The cemeteries

297
00:18:07:11 --> 00:18:09:00
are important

298
00:18:09:01 --> 00:18:12:24
because they are the way to renew
a pact with the territory

299
00:18:14:17 --> 00:18:15:25
through the corpses.

300
00:18:15:26 --> 00:18:20:19
I return the bodies to you
and I express my will to live here

301
00:18:21:02 --> 00:18:24:19
because I'm burying my relatives here,

302
00:18:25:12 --> 00:18:28:01
I come to this place, marks the world.

303
00:18:28:02 --> 00:18:32:13
Yeah, that's a very, very key thing between that

304
00:18:32:14 --> 00:18:36:25
world of the Samarians. There's a

305
00:18:36:26 --> 00:18:39:00
poem, there is a beautiful poem.

306
00:18:39:01 --> 00:18:42:18
Let me see if I can find it for you, because sometimes the literature
illuminates more,

307
00:18:43:01 --> 00:18:45:12
as much as anthropology.

308
00:18:45:22 --> 00:18:47:08
Yes.

309
00:18:47:09 --> 00:18:49:26
The poem. I don't know if you have read Vito Apshana

310
00:18:49:27 --> 00:18:51:02
No

311
00:18:51:02 --> 00:18:54:16
I advise you to read it.

312
00:18:56:06 --> 00:19:00:24
He is a great Wayuú poet.

313
00:19:00:25 --> 00:19:02:19
I'm going to put it here.

314
00:19:02:20 --> 00:19:04:28
I mean, the newcomer.

315
00:19:04:29 --> 00:19:08:10
And he has a poem.

316
00:19:09:05 --> 00:19:11:14
and the newcomers

317
00:19:23:05 --> 00:19:28:25
poetic and

318
00:19:29:13 --> 00:19:30:26
“Ancient newcomers”

319
00:19:30:26 --> 00:19:33:15
I recommend you this poem

320
00:19:34:00 --> 00:19:35:21
Vito Apshana.

321
00:19:37:15 --> 00:19:41:01
Yes, he has one,

322
00:19:44:12 --> 00:19:45:18
some very Wayuú poems

323
00:19:45:18 --> 00:19:48:23
Within the Wayuú ontology and thought,

324
00:19:49:24 --> 00:19:52:29
So one of the themes is that of the Earth.

325
00:19:53:24 --> 00:19:55:25
Well, he has a lot about Earth.

326
00:19:55:26 --> 00:19:57:20
But,

327
00:19:57:27 --> 00:20:01:29
but I like this one a lot.

328
00:20:02:00 --> 00:20:05:10
Yes, Ancient newcomers.

329
00:20:05:11 --> 00:20:07:26
Here it is

330
00:20:09:25 --> 00:20:11:01
I can

331
00:20:11:20 --> 00:20:19:02
I send it to you

332
00:20:19:03 --> 00:20:20:13
Here it is.

333
00:20:22:14 --> 00:20:24:28
And I send it to you.

334
00:20:24:29 --> 00:20:26:02
So that

335
00:20:33:21 --> 00:20:37:18
the people of La Guajira right?

336
00:20:37:19 --> 00:20:40:16
Yes, is here. I already sent you the link.

337
00:20:40:25 --> 00:20:41:15
You can get in there

338
00:20:42:07 --> 00:20:46:02
It's very beautiful.

339
00:20:46:05 --> 00:20:48:25
Yes, yes, very beautiful. His texts.

340
00:20:49:14 --> 00:20:52:17
He is coming here today.

341
00:20:52:18 --> 00:20:56:10
Yes, he comes today, he is in Bogotá, he will come today

342
00:20:57:13 --> 00:20:59:21
and I can give you the

343
00:20:59:22 --> 00:21:01:05
contact to interview you.

344
00:21:01:06 --> 00:21:02:20
One of these days.

345
00:21:02:20 --> 00:21:07:01
And yes, do an interview talking about his poems.

346
00:21:07:18 --> 00:21:10:14
His poems about the Earth are excellent, powerful

347
00:21:10:15 --> 00:21:15:03
From the earth, from a very good, powerful sun,
a message.

348
00:21:15:20 --> 00:21:17:26
That well, one verse sums up everything we have been talking

349
00:21:17:27 --> 00:21:18:25
about

350
00:21:18:26 --> 00:21:21:29
That's what poetry has.

351
00:21:22:26 --> 00:21:25:03
That gift, that strength

352
00:21:27:12 --> 00:21:30:18
Something beyond scientific words
or the words.

353
00:21:30:19 --> 00:21:34:18
Yes, yes, yes, that's right.

354
00:21:34:19 --> 00:21:44:17
And “Ancient newcomers”

355
00:21:44:18 --> 00:21:46:24
Then you get the whole book.

356
00:21:46:26 --> 00:22:32:20
I'm looking for poems by him.

357
00:22:32:21 --> 00:25:29:00
Yes, poetry.

358
00:25:29:03 --> 00:25:30:16
And well, I

359
00:25:30:25 --> 00:25:33:19
I sent you the link and I can give you the contact.

360
00:25:33:20 --> 00:25:36:20
I talk to him today I tell him you are here,
How long will they be there?

361
00:25:37:04 --> 00:25:40:09
We are in La Guajira, surely a

362
00:25:40:10 --> 00:25:42:29
two more weeks

363
00:25:43:12 --> 00:25:46:10
He's going to last nine days here, he's going to be busy,
but I know that

364
00:25:47:01 --> 00:25:49:11
He can take the time to talk to you.

365
00:25:50:08 --> 00:25:51:02
Because it is that he

366
00:25:51:02 --> 00:25:53:07
President is coming tomorrow.

367
00:25:54:20 --> 00:25:55:09
Petro. and is going to

368
00:25:55:09 --> 00:25:57:22
spend a week in La Guajira,

369
00:25:57:23 --> 00:25:59:12
A shaman?

370
00:25:59:13 --> 00:26:00:15
One week.

371
00:26:00:16 --> 00:26:01:23
Oh, a week.

372
00:26:01:23 --> 00:26:04:05
He will rule for a week from here

373
00:26:04:06 --> 00:26:06:10
then all the ministers come.

374
00:26:06:11 --> 00:26:09:16
They are going to be in Alta Guajira,
There are going to be many meetings with the population.

375
00:26:09:17 --> 00:26:10:16
Wayuú.

376
00:26:10:17 --> 00:26:12:18
With the population of the mountains, too.

377
00:26:12:19 --> 00:26:14:19
About the zoo?

378
00:26:14:20 --> 00:26:18:04
That is a good point, there are other points in water,

379
00:26:18:05 --> 00:26:21:12
malnutrition of children, health,

380
00:26:21:13 --> 00:26:22:12
education,

381
00:26:24:06 --> 00:26:25:23
they have other topics.

382
00:26:25:23 --> 00:26:29:08
Water is key, the issue of water is fundamental.

383
00:26:29:19 --> 00:26:31:09
But the theme about the parks too.

384
00:26:31:10 --> 00:26:36:08
They go to work
to see if they reach an agreement.

385
00:26:36:20 --> 00:26:39:09
And how long will you be here too?

386
00:26:39:10 --> 00:26:41:10
I'll be there until Friday.

387
00:26:41:10 --> 00:26:42:26
Until Friday?

388
00:26:42:27 --> 00:26:45:17
Yes because there is a festival in Bogotá, Festival Gabo.

389
00:26:46:08 --> 00:26:48:12
and then I'm going to go to

390
00:26:48:13 --> 00:26:49:05
festival, I have

391
00:26:49:05 --> 00:26:52:12
a conversation there for Bogotá. Yeah.

392
00:26:52:22 --> 00:26:58:01
It would be nice, maybe and we can come again
and make an interview recorded.

393
00:26:58:02 --> 00:27:02:01
Whenever you want, you tell me, let's set the date and here in the
house if you like.

394
00:27:02:02 --> 00:27:03:29
I know, here, here it is very nice.

395
00:27:04:00 --> 00:27:09:24
I think we can do two
one here and one outside, there the Earth itself.

396
00:27:10:02 --> 00:27:12:26
That's where such. Maybe it's not Monday or Tuesday.

397
00:27:12:27 --> 00:27:14:03
If you have time.

398
00:27:14:04 --> 00:27:16:26
And Tuesday can be Tuesday,
because on Monday it may be very.

399
00:27:16:27 --> 00:27:19:15
Still busy, but can. It will be Tuesday.

400
00:27:19:24 --> 00:27:22:19
Let's do Tuesday, then. Of course.

401
00:27:22:21 --> 00:27:26:19
Something before that I wanted to ask him.

402
00:27:27:21 --> 00:27:30:06
One approach of ours is

403
00:27:30:21 --> 00:27:33:21
Who should tell a story how should it be told?

404
00:27:33:26 --> 00:27:34:13
Of course.

405
00:27:34:14 --> 00:27:38:07
And last night or the night before, the day before yesterday

406
00:27:38:14 --> 00:27:42:13
there was talk about how good
Gabo's story,

407
00:27:42:20 --> 00:27:46:19
I don't remember the name of the book
but because it was from a perspective within the Wayuú.

408
00:27:46:20 --> 00:27:49:08
La Cándida Eréndira.

409
00:27:49:09 --> 00:27:53:14
Yes, that one. And so what we're doing is on Wednesday,

410
00:27:53:15 --> 00:27:57:14
We are going to meet with a young Wayuú, his name is

411
00:27:57:25 --> 00:27:58:21
Neko.

412
00:27:59:04 --> 00:28:01:27
Neko is

413
00:28:01:28 --> 00:28:05:06
It is from near Manaure, where there is a ranch.

414
00:28:05:07 --> 00:28:08:07
There we had the contact of a friend and well,

415
00:28:08:08 --> 00:28:12:18
He is a director starting out in cinema and he

416
00:28:12:19 --> 00:28:16:00
He is going to be like our director for this chapter.

417
00:28:16:13 --> 00:28:17:14
Well.

418
00:28:17:15 --> 00:28:19:25
I have a friend, David Hernández.

419
00:28:19:26 --> 00:28:25:06
David Fernández also directs
He has made documentaries about the Wayuús

420
00:28:25:07 --> 00:28:26:12
He’s made videos, he’s made movies

421
00:28:26:13 --> 00:28:29:27
Yes, Wayuú from Venezuela, David Hernández Palmar

422
00:28:29:28 --> 00:28:33:05
No, a group of Wayuú youth has been formed here

423
00:28:33:06 --> 00:28:35:23
in that audiovisual world.

424
00:28:36:14 --> 00:28:37:13
Seeing that there is a lot.

425
00:28:37:14 --> 00:28:39:14
So many, Leiqui Uriana.

426
00:28:39:14 --> 00:28:43:21
The other girl, Polanco, Mile Polanco

427
00:28:43:22 --> 00:28:47:01
in Cabo de la Vela there is a collective.

428
00:28:47:15 --> 00:28:50:15
Of young Wayú, but very good. Yeah.

429
00:28:51:25 --> 00:28:54:29
They have played a very important role and.

430
00:28:55:13 --> 00:28:57:12
And that's fine.

431
00:28:57:13 --> 00:29:00:28
Following that theme,
we wanted to ask you

432
00:29:01:16 --> 00:29:03:18
if you

433
00:29:04:06 --> 00:29:06:23
would make a wayuú documentary,

434
00:29:07:14 --> 00:29:10:15
How would you do it,
Like I don't know what things

435
00:29:11:07 --> 00:29:14:09
would like, how to put, capture,

436
00:29:14:10 --> 00:29:17:06
explain, what would it be like I don't know,

437
00:29:17:24 --> 00:29:20:17
the story as such that I would believe

438
00:29:21:18 --> 00:29:23:01
There is an advantage with the world

439
00:29:23:01 --> 00:29:25:19
Wayuú and it is that in

440
00:29:25:20 --> 00:29:27:29
their cosmology are in the territory.

441
00:29:28:25 --> 00:29:33:05
So when we go to a hill
like the Teta hill,

442
00:29:33:06 --> 00:29:37:14
that hill speaks to us,
He talks to us, he is telling us things.

443
00:29:38:20 --> 00:29:40:26
Every time you focus on an image,

444
00:29:40:27 --> 00:29:43:18
only the image is telling us things

445
00:29:44:05 --> 00:29:48:09
and there are some popular hills,
I would say that there are about three tutelary hills,

446
00:29:48:17 --> 00:29:51:02
the word would be tutelary, which are

447
00:29:51:28 --> 00:29:56:01
at Cabo La Vela,
a hill called Kamachi, the old. Epitsü that’s near Uribia

448
00:29:56:07 --> 00:30:00:28
which is the Teta Hill and in the upper part,
in La Macuira, there is hill Iitujolu, but those hills

449
00:30:00:29 --> 00:30:06:08
they are brothers,
They are hills that guard the territory,

450
00:30:06:28 --> 00:30:09:19
that give order and meaning to the territory.

451
00:30:09:20 --> 00:30:12:23
Now, there are other small hills that are very rich

452
00:30:12:24 --> 00:30:16:28
historically they are in the cape, you can see Bantu, Piirra and,

453
00:30:18:19 --> 00:30:22:06
others are there near that one and there are many mythical places.

454
00:30:23:10 --> 00:30:25:23
So I would focus a lot

455
00:30:25:24 --> 00:30:28:05
in the geographical

456
00:30:28:06 --> 00:30:32:11
Landmarks of the territory,
because each geographical landmark,

457
00:30:33:02 --> 00:30:35:23
Their single image is already a set of stories.

458
00:30:37:01 --> 00:30:41:17
He is speaking to us, as soon as you
focus on it, he is speaking.

459
00:30:41:18 --> 00:30:44:15
And there is even a book that I don't know
if you know,

460
00:30:45:08 --> 00:30:48:25
Small and simple, stories with GPS.

461
00:30:50:12 --> 00:30:51:16
What is called Stories with GPS?

462
00:30:51:16 --> 00:30:53:15
Stories with GPS.

463
00:30:53:24 --> 00:30:56:12
No,

464
00:30:56:13 --> 00:31:01:08
Yes, in fact, we just read it,
I believe because he quotes you a lot in fact.

465
00:31:01:09 --> 00:31:03:03
In that there is

466
00:31:03:11 --> 00:31:04:07
Stories with GPS

467
00:31:04:08 --> 00:31:05:07
Let me see if I send it to you

468
00:31:05:07 --> 00:31:08:00
because it is a trip that I took,

469
00:31:08:01 --> 00:31:09:25
I was the guide,

470
00:31:10:00 --> 00:31:12:08
the Historical Memory Commission,

471
00:31:12:27 --> 00:31:17:00
they wanted to visit La Guajira
and they wanted me to show them that.

472
00:31:17:07 --> 00:31:19:18
Well, here it is. This is the book.

473
00:31:20:19 --> 00:31:21:29
Okay.

474
00:31:22:00 --> 00:31:24:21
This is from the internet, it can be downloaded on the web.

475
00:31:24:24 --> 00:31:28:11
I think maybe if we read this. Yes Yes.

476
00:31:28:12 --> 00:31:30:06
So this,

477
00:31:30:07 --> 00:31:32:14
This, for example, is the hill of Guososopo

478
00:31:33:07 --> 00:31:34:02
Guososopo

479
00:31:34:02 --> 00:31:38:24
It means our lungs,
because this is as if you

480
00:31:40:15 --> 00:31:43:01
you would open a person's lungs, alive,

481
00:31:43:20 --> 00:31:45:23
and they would look like this pink.

482
00:31:46:15 --> 00:31:51:26
A Wayuú who in mythical times
He traveled from the Sierra Nevada,

483
00:31:51:27 --> 00:31:53:07
He traveled all this

484
00:31:53:08 --> 00:31:54:12
and died of thirst

485
00:31:54:12 --> 00:31:59:05
in the desert,
Only his lungs were left, turned into hills.

486
00:31:59:21 --> 00:32:04:24
So this hill is a story and it is a hill,
then like this

487
00:32:05:02 --> 00:32:07:22
each one of those hills has a meaning,

488
00:32:08:09 --> 00:32:11:28
has a story to tell,
so that's why we did it

489
00:32:11:29 --> 00:32:15:25
So, we traveled for three days stopping in each place,

490
00:32:15:26 --> 00:32:19:13
I told the mythical stories,
That is the story of this book.

491
00:32:19:25 --> 00:32:22:03
Yes, yes.

492
00:32:22:04 --> 00:32:23:26
And in there, like this

493
00:32:24:29 --> 00:32:27:06
they are inside there are

494
00:32:27:08 --> 00:32:31:15
So I would focus on that, if you want,

495
00:32:32:28 --> 00:32:35:06
work the territory very visually.

496
00:32:35:07 --> 00:32:36:23
Sometimes they focus on homes and yes,

497
00:32:36:24 --> 00:32:41:03
homes are important,
but there are multiple, thousands of homes.

498
00:32:41:15 --> 00:32:46:01
Instead, these places,
talk to those background places,

499
00:32:46:02 --> 00:32:46:29
the sea too

500
00:32:49:02 --> 00:32:51:15
or a territorial root.

501
00:32:51:26 --> 00:32:54:24
There is a stone, the stone of Aalasü
that is up there,

502
00:32:56:08 --> 00:32:57:22
that stone is mythological,

503
00:32:57:22 --> 00:32:59:23
there are all the family clan emblems,

504
00:33:00:24 --> 00:33:02:25
That stone tells us a lot.

505
00:33:02:26 --> 00:33:06:03
Let's see if I have it here.

506
00:33:06:04 --> 00:33:09:21
If I have it.

507
00:33:09:22 --> 00:33:13:29
It seems that no, I don't have it here,

508
00:33:14:20 --> 00:33:17:07
but I'm going to put it

509
00:33:17:13 --> 00:33:21:19
Ancient newcomers. Is…

510
00:33:27:26 --> 00:33:29:13
so that's my idea.

511
00:33:29:13 --> 00:33:30:05
Now,

512
00:33:30:26 --> 00:33:33:05
There are trees that tell us a lot.

513
00:33:33:06 --> 00:33:33:17
Also.

514
00:33:33:18 --> 00:33:38:01
Because they are stories about trees
and a beautiful, fundamental, very common tree

515
00:33:38:02 --> 00:33:40:27
here is Trujillo, it's called Aipia.

516
00:33:41:16 --> 00:33:44:06
His task was to heal

517
00:33:44:07 --> 00:33:46:20
the fractures of people when they were human,

518
00:33:47:14 --> 00:33:51:10
before it became a
tree, he dedicated himself to healing

519
00:33:52:10 --> 00:33:56:08
and today if you break your leg,
an arm,

520
00:33:56:26 --> 00:34:01:16
They splint it for you with wood from Trupillo,
because that was his job

521
00:34:02:16 --> 00:34:07:08
and it is a tree that the Wayuú leave near their homes.

522
00:34:07:19 --> 00:34:11:08
They generally cut down everything
to have a view of who is arriving.

523
00:34:11:27 --> 00:34:12:15
So.

524
00:34:12:15 --> 00:34:14:26
But the tree they leave is Trupillo

525
00:34:15:26 --> 00:34:19:12
His name is Aipia and he is very wise, he is peaceful.

526
00:34:19:13 --> 00:34:23:06
It has many advantages.

527
00:34:23:07 --> 00:34:24:20
Gives food,

528
00:34:25:00 --> 00:34:28:26
Before it gave nutritious food,
proteins, vegetables.

529
00:34:29:08 --> 00:34:31:11
Nowadays the Wayuú have somewhat lost their consumption of

530
00:34:31:12 --> 00:34:33:09
that was

531
00:34:33:10 --> 00:34:35:13
so important for Wayuú nutrition.

532
00:34:35:27 --> 00:34:38:28
So the trees tell us things,

533
00:34:39:13 --> 00:34:44:13
So if you focus, you are going to film, look.
what do you have back there,

534
00:34:44:24 --> 00:34:49:08
because surely there is a story in the plant,
It is more than a backdrop,

535
00:34:49:26 --> 00:34:51:17
It is a story.

536
00:34:51:18 --> 00:34:54:01
Yes, so that is what I was going to recommend,

537
00:34:55:05 --> 00:34:58:04
That would be my advice. The rest,

538
00:34:58:05 --> 00:35:01:11
Well, the Earth is an excellent starting point,

539
00:35:01:14 --> 00:35:03:26
perhaps the deepest starting point

540
00:35:04:25 --> 00:35:06:27
It is the issue of territory.

541
00:35:06:28 --> 00:35:09:12
I would have coastal areas,

542
00:35:09:13 --> 00:35:13:14
inland areas, of shepherds, the Wayuú economy

543
00:35:13:25 --> 00:35:16:01
It tells us about a relationship with the land.

544
00:35:17:14 --> 00:35:20:26
Wayuú agriculture is beautiful, and I talked about it
that night.

545
00:35:20:27 --> 00:35:23:03
What's the point of all this?

546
00:35:23:12 --> 00:35:29:10
Grazing, fishing, weaving also speak to us,
because the fabric

547
00:35:29:23 --> 00:35:33:03
look at this,

548
00:35:33:04 --> 00:35:37:07
This is a Wayuú fabric,
but this is a fabric of the sea,

549
00:35:38:04 --> 00:35:43:18
This is called like the eye of the fish,
like the eye of the fish.

550
00:35:44:03 --> 00:35:47:09
So I'm going to show it to you here,

551
00:35:47:10 --> 00:35:48:15
rather,

552
00:35:49:14 --> 00:35:53:25
These are Wayuú graphics, canoe graphics.

553
00:35:54:04 --> 00:35:55:18
So,

554
00:35:55:19 --> 00:35:58:02
when filming a documentary

555
00:35:58:03 --> 00:35:59:29
I would say that,

556
00:36:01:17 --> 00:36:02:17
look at this,

557
00:36:02:24 --> 00:36:07:26
They are the Wayuú
hanging fish like leaves

558
00:36:08:05 --> 00:36:10:05
So,

559
00:36:10:06 --> 00:36:13:29
What I mean is that when we see a backpack,

560
00:36:14:15 --> 00:36:17:19
When we see a Wayuú object, it is talking to us,

561
00:36:18:12 --> 00:36:21:06
but sometimes we go over it

562
00:36:21:07 --> 00:36:24:00
like shapes that have no message that’s just a fabric.

563
00:36:24:15 --> 00:36:26:28
This means like the eye of the fish,

564
00:36:27:23 --> 00:36:31:02
like the eye of the fish.

565
00:36:31:03 --> 00:36:32:15
So,

566
00:36:32:18 --> 00:36:34:27
I would also suggest

567
00:36:36:16 --> 00:36:38:13
To do a lot in

568
00:36:38:13 --> 00:36:42:00
in the graphics, in the designs, in the objects.

569
00:36:42:01 --> 00:36:44:19
The artifacts have a meaning and they are
Talking to us

570
00:36:44:20 --> 00:36:47:17
It’s just that we don't know how to read, we don't know how to read,

571
00:36:47:26 --> 00:36:51:08
we would be illiterate in these graphics,
as if we saw

572
00:36:52:17 --> 00:36:53:24
a sign written in

573
00:36:53:24 --> 00:36:57:07
Russian or Hindi or Chinese, one could not read it,

574
00:36:57:08 --> 00:36:59:00
Well, that's what happens with Wayuú graphics.

575
00:36:59:00 --> 00:37:01:18
Yes.

576
00:37:02:12 --> 00:37:05:24
Look at this for example.

577
00:37:05:25 --> 00:37:07:18
That's nice.
From Palabrero.

578
00:37:08:26 --> 00:37:12:00
Yes, Oops, yes.

579
00:37:12:27 --> 00:37:15:00
This is the first bird

580
00:37:15:13 --> 00:37:18:16
who worked as a palabrero

581
00:37:18:17 --> 00:37:19:25
in mythological times.

582
00:37:19:25 --> 00:37:23:23
He created the Wayuú laws, the norms
and then he retired.

583
00:37:24:09 --> 00:37:28:18
But the knowledge they have of the
Wayuú laws belong to a bird.

584
00:37:29:06 --> 00:37:31:07
Utta is called Utta

585
00:37:31:22 --> 00:37:33:12
and can you still see it?

586
00:37:33:13 --> 00:37:36:16
Yes, the bird exists, of course, I have photographed it.

587
00:37:36:17 --> 00:37:38:17
Of course.

588
00:37:38:18 --> 00:37:40:20
It's a big bird, it's tame.

589
00:37:40:21 --> 00:37:43:19
It's not a bird that gets scared, but no, no, no,

590
00:37:44:00 --> 00:37:47:06
I approached him very close.

591
00:37:47:07 --> 00:37:48:27
He has a bird necklace, here,

592
00:37:48:28 --> 00:37:51:01
a black, yellow and black necklace.

593
00:37:51:02 --> 00:37:52:18
They awarded that necklace,

594
00:37:52:18 --> 00:37:57:01
It was given by Mareiwa,
one of the Wayú figures, for having given the laws

595
00:37:57:06 --> 00:37:59:11
he rewarded him.

596
00:38:09:09 --> 00:38:12:22
and have you seen many signs and symbols like that?

597
00:38:12:24 --> 00:38:15:20
Well, this is my clan.
Your clan?
Mine Yes, yes, yes.

598
00:38:16:23 --> 00:38:17:19
That's why it's there.

599
00:38:17:19 --> 00:38:19:11
That's why I

600
00:38:20:07 --> 00:38:21:14
said,

601
00:38:21:15 --> 00:38:24:15
I was saying that,

602
00:38:24:20 --> 00:38:28:03
that,

603
00:38:28:04 --> 00:38:35:13
that the graphics speak to us,
but we passed over it.

604
00:38:59:03 --> 00:39:01:03
So,

605
00:39:04:01 --> 00:39:07:13
a girl said that night,

606
00:39:07:14 --> 00:39:09:11
a girl said,

607
00:39:09:12 --> 00:39:12:23
Out of all the musical instruments that,

608
00:39:12:25 --> 00:39:13:22
This one is,

609
00:39:13:23 --> 00:39:16:28
But they haven't removed this one's beak.

610
00:39:16:29 --> 00:39:18:17
For this to be a musical instrument,

611
00:39:18:17 --> 00:39:20:17
well, it has to be perfect here, closed

612
00:39:21:08 --> 00:39:23:15
and here one takes off his beak

613
00:39:23:27 --> 00:39:25:19
and it is played like this,

614
00:39:25:20 --> 00:39:28:08
but only from the Wayuú fishermen.

615
00:39:28:09 --> 00:39:30:10
Yes, to communicate.

616
00:39:30:18 --> 00:39:33:18
To communicate yes.

617
00:39:34:12 --> 00:39:37:15
That's interesting because I don't know if you saw it but in

618
00:39:37:29 --> 00:39:40:24
Peru there is an indigenous town, it is called Pituquisca

619
00:39:40:25 --> 00:39:43:28
of the Quechua up the mountain, in the Andes.

620
00:39:43:29 --> 00:39:44:29
Have.

621
00:39:45:00 --> 00:39:48:04
And they have, of course, and they bartered with those on the coast.

622
00:39:49:06 --> 00:39:50:09
The Mayans too,

623
00:39:50:10 --> 00:39:50:28
From the Mayans too

624
00:39:50:28 --> 00:39:51:22
a lot, the

625
00:39:51:22 --> 00:39:54:15
Mayans in Mexico and yes,

626
00:39:54:28 --> 00:39:58:05
In Yucatán that entire area touches those snails.

627
00:39:58:06 --> 00:40:01:24
It must have been a very broad horizon.
among the peoples of America.

628
00:40:01:25 --> 00:40:03:28
The snail
Yes, that's right.

629
00:40:04:08 --> 00:40:08:16
Because I saw a drum and I was in Canadá
about 15 days ago

630
00:40:09:10 --> 00:40:12:17
and I had touring up to Winnipeg
throughout that area.

631
00:40:13:02 --> 00:40:13:18
Yeah

632
00:40:15:07 --> 00:40:17:01
I was in Canadá

633
00:40:17:02 --> 00:40:20:02
I was way up north,
The big rapids and all that,

634
00:40:20:16 --> 00:40:23:23
touring indigenous towns and talking

635
00:40:23:24 --> 00:40:26:17
And we had rituals and everything.

636
00:40:26:18 --> 00:40:29:28
And I saw drums, indigenous drums

637
00:40:30:15 --> 00:40:32:04
in Canada.

638
00:40:32:05 --> 00:40:35:12
Similar to the ones here?
Similar, similar, but with only one instrument.

639
00:40:35:13 --> 00:40:39:04
It is played with only one, not two like the Wayuú but one.

640
00:40:39:14 --> 00:40:43:04
And I saw drums of one layer and others like that, and other made

641
00:40:43:05 --> 00:40:47:14
with deer stomach
or bison which are water drums.

642
00:40:48:05 --> 00:40:49:29
Yes, very interesting.

643
00:40:49:29 --> 00:40:52:13
And I was in several ceremonies and everything there in Canada.

644
00:40:53:06 --> 00:40:56:08
So there are a series of instruments

645
00:40:56:27 --> 00:41:01:14
very, very common,
those found, for example,

646
00:41:03:28 --> 00:41:07:09
The Wayuú have these, but they have them as maracas.

647
00:41:07:19 --> 00:41:08:03
They got them

648
00:41:08:04 --> 00:41:08:17
as

649
00:41:08:17 --> 00:41:12:14
a musical instrument,
They have this with bison horn.

650
00:41:15:06 --> 00:41:16:20
And this is,

651
00:41:16:21 --> 00:41:19:18
It is used for the shamanic ceremony,

652
00:41:20:08 --> 00:41:24:24
to go up, find the spirits up there, to heal.

653
00:41:25:09 --> 00:41:30:17
So this sound allows it to rise
and the tobacco that the woman chews

654
00:41:30:18 --> 00:41:31:26
shaman woman,

655
00:41:31:27 --> 00:41:36:24
It goes up and there it finds in the elevation
the spirit that will help her heal.

656
00:41:37:02 --> 00:41:41:11
And then the Canadians have it too,
but they do it with their animals that they have next to them.

657
00:41:41:13 --> 00:41:44:01
Yes of the bison.

658
00:41:44:15 --> 00:41:46:05
Do you have seeds in there?
Seeds.

659
00:41:49:25 --> 00:41:54:08
That's what you were telling me about the clan symbol,

660
00:41:54:20 --> 00:41:58:26
I wanted to know a little more about you,
that is, you are from

661
00:41:59:18 --> 00:42:03:12
My area is Carrizal, up there, Carrizal.

662
00:42:03:25 --> 00:42:05:27
Carrizal, yes, I'm going to show you,

663
00:42:06:24 --> 00:42:10:06
Carrizal is,

664
00:42:10:07 --> 00:42:13:20
the land of my ancestors.

665
00:42:14:10 --> 00:42:16:20
But that's close to the beach
by Cabo de la Vela.

666
00:42:17:10 --> 00:42:18:15
If there is

667
00:42:18:16 --> 00:42:20:19
the cemetery,

668
00:42:20:20 --> 00:42:28:01
That's why I tell you it's so important.

669
00:43:10:14 --> 00:43:14:19
This is located here, perhaps
you saw it here.

670
00:43:17:16 --> 00:43:21:02
Look at the hills, the hill, the Cabo de la Vela,
I tell you that it is a story,

671
00:43:21:04 --> 00:43:24:06
Kamachi married a windy woman,

672
00:43:24:07 --> 00:43:27:03
He manages the things of the sea.
This is the older brother, he is in the Macuira,

673
00:43:27:04 --> 00:43:29:02
Itojolu

674
00:43:29:19 --> 00:43:31:21
This is the brother, another of the younger brothers.

675
00:43:31:22 --> 00:43:34:09
It is towards the Gulf with Venezuela through Uribia,

676
00:43:35:16 --> 00:43:38:07
Epitsü, Cerro de la Teta.

677
00:43:38:08 --> 00:43:42:01
Each being is a story,
This is a relative of mine, relatives

678
00:43:42:02 --> 00:43:43:26
mine, is on a map of the hills.

679
00:43:43:27 --> 00:43:48:07
Look in La Guajira
how the hills form a triangle, they are tutelary,

680
00:43:48:12 --> 00:43:51:17
In the territory you have to understand their position.

681
00:43:52:06 --> 00:43:54:25
This is a place where there is cattle,

682
00:43:55:25 --> 00:43:57:19
Here I want to show you,

683
00:43:57:19 --> 00:44:00:03
They are Wayuú fishermen.

684
00:44:00:05 --> 00:44:02:11
Wayuú fishermen.

685
00:44:03:21 --> 00:44:07:28
This place is mythological in Cabo de la Vela
It's called xxxx,

686
00:44:08:20 --> 00:44:10:24
It is the hospital where they cure the fish.

687
00:44:11:11 --> 00:44:13:05
The fish have an owner, an owner.

688
00:44:13:05 --> 00:44:16:03
She, she, she is the owner and her name is Pulowi.

689
00:44:17:00 --> 00:44:18:17
She is the owner of the animals.

690
00:44:18:17 --> 00:44:20:24
To fish you have to ask for permission.

691
00:44:21:03 --> 00:44:21:27
You have to do a

692
00:44:21:27 --> 00:44:27:15
ritual and all that, because fish are marine cattle
and those are her flocks.

693
00:44:28:01 --> 00:44:31:20
So
when the fishermen hit them with a harpoon

694
00:44:31:21 --> 00:44:34:17
or a hook and a fishmonger, they are cured there.

695
00:44:35:08 --> 00:44:38:09
That place that is on the cabo.

696
00:44:38:10 --> 00:44:40:15
From here,

697
00:44:41:27 --> 00:44:44:02
They are tombs...

698
00:44:47:13 --> 00:44:49:14
and then in the

699
00:44:49:15 --> 00:44:52:03
sea, in the cape, these are the jepira
a mythological place

700
00:44:52:04 --> 00:44:57:05
in the cape, the children there in the cape,

701
00:44:57:09 --> 00:44:58:03
this is there in the cape,

702
00:44:59:23 --> 00:45:01:15
This is Bahia Onda, this is Bahia Onda, a place too, this

703
00:45:01:16 --> 00:45:04:28
It was a tour of all of Guajira.

704
00:45:05:02 --> 00:45:09:14
in the Macuira, the Macuira

705
00:45:11:15 --> 00:45:11:29
Ah, this is a

706
00:45:11:29 --> 00:45:13:18
mythical place, this was,

707
00:45:14:05 --> 00:45:16:06
She was the first Wayuú woman.

708
00:45:16:07 --> 00:45:17:28
One of the first women,

709
00:45:17:29 --> 00:45:20:17
I had a dentated vagina, she

710
00:45:20:18 --> 00:45:23:28
Couldn’t have relations with anyone,
could not be reproduced

711
00:45:24:13 --> 00:45:26:21
and some wayuú twins

712
00:45:27:03 --> 00:45:31:15
they shot them with an arrow
and all her teeth were blown out.

713
00:45:31:16 --> 00:45:34:24
So, that is a very beautiful myth.

714
00:45:34:25 --> 00:45:35:12
It's called Wolunka,

715
00:45:36:10 --> 00:45:38:10
Wolunka the woman with

716
00:45:38:11 --> 00:45:39:24
the toothed vagina.

717
00:45:41:14 --> 00:45:43:17
This is the stone that I tell you,

718
00:45:43:18 --> 00:45:44:16
Aalasü,

719
00:45:44:17 --> 00:45:47:09
There are all the irons, chlamys,
emblems, look at them,

720
00:45:47:10 --> 00:45:50:11
They are there,

Are they there?
Written there, there they are. Yeah.

721
00:45:50:13 --> 00:45:53:15
Oh, yeah. and does

722
00:45:54:00 --> 00:45:55:17
many years?
Many, of course.

723
00:45:55:17 --> 00:46:00:14
It's a thing that in time,
In mythological time no, they do not have a date,

724
00:46:00:15 --> 00:46:01:26
but in mythical time.

725
00:46:01:27 --> 00:46:04:03
Yes Aalasü,

726
00:46:04:04 --> 00:46:07:03
Aalasü, the stone of the marks, that remains

727
00:46:08:18 --> 00:46:10:04
close to Siapana,

728
00:46:10:05 --> 00:46:12:24
near a place called Wuipa,

729
00:46:14:04 --> 00:46:16:05
Wuipa

730
00:46:17:27 --> 00:46:20:08
It's about six hours from here by car.

731
00:46:22:10 --> 00:46:27:01
It is a beautiful place,
but it is a fundamental place for

732
00:46:27:02 --> 00:46:28:21
Wayuú in the world of myth.

733
00:46:37:06 --> 00:46:37:26
All that

734
00:46:37:26 --> 00:46:39:13
route

735
00:46:42:10 --> 00:46:44:20
and I don't know why not here

736
00:46:44:21 --> 00:46:49:19
Did not come out, it should come out quickly my

737
00:46:49:20 --> 00:46:51:18
cemetery because it is there.

738
00:46:51:19 --> 00:46:52:22
Click here, download PDF.

739
00:46:52:22 --> 00:46:58:03
Charging.

740
00:46:58:04 --> 00:46:59:05
We'll see.

741
00:47:21:06 --> 00:47:23:28
This same book in a more organized PDF.

742
00:47:23:29 --> 00:47:25:02
Better.

743
00:47:25:11 --> 00:47:28:09
Look, here you have this photo,
I can send it to you by pdf,

744
00:47:28:10 --> 00:47:30:21
but I don't know if you saw it, you already have it.

745
00:47:31:03 --> 00:47:35:16
We already saw what we just showed ourselves,
but that's the same, but in

746
00:47:36:13 --> 00:47:37:22
Book shape, right?

747
00:47:37:22 --> 00:47:39:27
Book form, sure, but here it is,

748
00:47:40:29 --> 00:47:41:16
Here you must

749
00:47:41:16 --> 00:47:43:12
be the Cemetery,

750
00:47:43:13 --> 00:47:45:26
I don't know why it didn't come out.

751
00:47:47:11 --> 00:47:48:26
This is a mythological place,

752
00:47:48:26 --> 00:47:50:12
This is The Turtles of Pájara.

753
00:47:50:12 --> 00:47:52:02
This is my territory,

754
00:47:52:03 --> 00:47:54:12
where the Wayuú took up cattle,

755
00:47:55:03 --> 00:47:57:20
the cattle for the Wayuú came from the sea,

756
00:47:57:21 --> 00:47:59:24
They were turtles that turned into cows

757
00:48:00:12 --> 00:48:03:02
and fish that turned into goats,

758
00:48:03:03 --> 00:48:05:15
then one night they caught them

759
00:48:05:16 --> 00:48:06:18
and the

760
00:48:07:08 --> 00:48:08:13
they took and

761
00:48:08:13 --> 00:48:10:28
He converted them, and that is why they were able to have the animals.

762
00:48:55:04 --> 00:48:57:17
Here is my cemetery.

763
00:49:05:02 --> 00:49:09:05
look here at the stone from another perspective,
the stone where all the marks are.

764
00:49:12:07 --> 00:49:13:04
Serrania of what?

765
00:49:13:18 --> 00:49:15:21
This is in Aalasü,

766
00:49:15:22 --> 00:49:16:20
this is,

767
00:49:16:20 --> 00:49:18:15
close to la Macuira,

768
00:49:18:23 --> 00:49:19:17
not in the Macuira,

769
00:49:19:17 --> 00:49:22:01
But close. Yes, yes, close.

770
00:49:22:29 --> 00:49:25:16
This is here in Carrizales about an hour

771
00:49:26:03 --> 00:49:29:05
and a half by car, easy to go.

772
00:49:33:01 --> 00:49:36:16
You have been telling me that the hills themselves,

773
00:49:36:17 --> 00:49:39:24
the symbols, the plants, they all have a story, right?

774
00:49:40:00 --> 00:49:41:02
Everything has a meaning.

775
00:49:41:02 --> 00:49:43:05
What would one be like?

776
00:49:44:00 --> 00:49:46:28
How could one capture that in film?

777
00:49:46:29 --> 00:49:50:21
I mean, would it be someone telling the story more than anything?

778
00:49:50:22 --> 00:49:55:17
Yes, it would be good if someone told it with that in the background,
Someone would tell it with that in the background.

779
00:49:56:04 --> 00:50:00:20
Yes, I'm trying to think of how
We can give our own voice.

780
00:50:00:21 --> 00:50:01:12
That's correct

781
00:50:01:12 --> 00:50:02:01
to the thing, right?

782
00:50:02:02 --> 00:50:05:02
That's right, that's right.

783
00:50:05:16 --> 00:50:08:21
Because they talk, because I know what they're talking about,
but it's hard

784
00:50:08:22 --> 00:50:11:18
sometimes show that.

785
00:50:11:24 --> 00:50:12:23
Of course, of course.

786
00:50:12:23 --> 00:50:13:21
The grace is that there is a

787
00:50:13:21 --> 00:50:16:17
history in each of those places.

788
00:50:17:03 --> 00:50:19:16
Cemeteries also speak to us.

789
00:50:20:13 --> 00:50:23:23
I'm sorry not, I don't know why I didn't find it,

790
00:50:24:12 --> 00:50:26:05
the book the poem

791
00:50:26:06 --> 00:50:31:25
From this poem, from Vito Apshana, which was so beautiful, that

792
00:50:32:10 --> 00:50:35:24
It seems to me that that also has a huge power

793
00:50:37:13 --> 00:50:40:19
In fact, I think that would be a very good way to

794
00:50:42:06 --> 00:50:46:08
make the trees, the hills,
They speak in poems.

795
00:50:46:14 --> 00:50:47:11
Yes, it is

796
00:50:47:12 --> 00:50:48:21
a little more abstract but oh well.

797
00:50:48:21 --> 00:50:51:08
Let's see, let's see if I can find it.

798
00:50:51:09 --> 00:50:59:13
Ancient newcorners.

799
00:51:09:04 --> 00:51:10:26
But here look,

800
00:51:10:26 --> 00:51:12:17
for example, this.

801
00:51:13:04 --> 00:51:15:07
I wrote this column

802
00:51:15:08 --> 00:51:17:22
and published it in El Espectador.

803
00:51:17:23 --> 00:51:19:23
Look at it here, here is this part

804
00:51:20:27 --> 00:51:23:26
to explain the relationship of the Wayuú

805
00:51:24:04 --> 00:51:26:27
with its land, with its cemetery,

806
00:51:26:28 --> 00:51:30:09
the place of belonging,

807
00:51:30:10 --> 00:51:33:02
because the Wayuú have a very beautiful notion,

808
00:51:33:03 --> 00:51:35:13
is the place of birth

809
00:51:35:14 --> 00:51:39:19
and there is a place of residence
I live here in Riohacha, but this does not belong to me.

810
00:51:40:02 --> 00:51:44:06
My place of belonging is my cemetery,
that is the place in the world to which

811
00:51:44:07 --> 00:51:46:04
I am assigned, assigned to

812
00:51:46:05 --> 00:51:47:21
that's the place.

813
00:51:48:01 --> 00:51:50:01
Then look at the poem it says,

814
00:51:51:19 --> 00:51:53:19
you were already born, they say

815
00:51:54:02 --> 00:51:56:19
to a wayuú, you were already born

816
00:51:58:04 --> 00:52:00:06
and you were born the son of people,

817
00:52:01:00 --> 00:52:03:21
of the founders of Trocha del Cerro Epitsü,

818
00:52:05:08 --> 00:52:07:07
and you can go

819
00:52:07:08 --> 00:52:10:24
and you may not come back, but you will always be there,

820
00:52:12:02 --> 00:52:14:04
next to the tree Mokoshira

821
00:52:14:15 --> 00:52:16:14
that surrounds your cemetery

822
00:52:16:14 --> 00:52:20:00
and there belongs your shadow and your rest.

823
00:52:20:09 --> 00:52:22:14
Look at the beauty, ok,

824
00:52:22:15 --> 00:52:26:29
can move. When these
wind farms are arriving in La Guajira,

825
00:52:27:15 --> 00:52:29:17
they are wrong,

826
00:52:29:18 --> 00:52:32:06
they talk to the people who are there

827
00:52:32:26 --> 00:52:36:11
and they believe that those who are there are the owners,

828
00:52:36:12 --> 00:52:40:08
and the owners may be far away because

829
00:52:41:11 --> 00:52:43:29
They can live anywhere in the world,

830
00:52:44:16 --> 00:52:48:14
but its territory is there,
that belongs to them, they are assigned there.

831
00:52:48:25 --> 00:52:54:12
The other could be a son,
but children have no right over the land.

832
00:52:55:01 --> 00:52:58:06
Children only have the right
on the land of their mothers.

833
00:52:59:04 --> 00:53:02:05
So a parent can leave them there.
as guardians.

834
00:53:02:14 --> 00:53:04:28
You take care, but you don't decide about it

835
00:53:04:29 --> 00:53:06:09
territory.

836
00:53:06:09 --> 00:53:08:22
I'm leaving, I am the owner of that territory,

837
00:53:09:05 --> 00:53:12:15
then the son who remains there has the right to live,
but not to decide.

838
00:53:13:03 --> 00:53:15:02
So that's a bit of the conflict.

839
00:53:15:03 --> 00:53:19:24
the conflict that is coming,

between the government and….
Of course,
because the companies arrive, oh

840
00:53:20:00 --> 00:53:22:25
I spoke to the person who lives there! Wait a minute that's not

841
00:53:22:26 --> 00:53:25:13
the son’s, nor the grandson’s.

842
00:53:25:26 --> 00:53:28:23
His territory is his mother's, not that one, he

843
00:53:29:08 --> 00:53:34:01
there he is taking care. And that's why there are so many conflicts,
for not understanding this.

844
00:53:34:13 --> 00:53:38:14
For me, the conflict with companies
and with all this topic

845
00:53:38:15 --> 00:53:43:01
on the land, with the mining companies, with the companies
wind, is not understanding

846
00:53:43:18 --> 00:53:45:25
the sense of the territory,

847
00:53:46:12 --> 00:53:49:08
the sense of the trees, the sense of the landscape.

848
00:53:49:21 --> 00:53:54:15
For the Wayuú the landscape speaks, speaks,
is telling a story,

849
00:53:54:16 --> 00:54:00:20
It is not a decorative thing: it is not a postcard
of beautiful photography to promote tourism, no.

850
00:54:01:11 --> 00:54:03:17
The territory is telling you things.

851
00:54:04:07 --> 00:54:07:11
So when you pass, you read the territory.

852
00:54:07:16 --> 00:54:10:23
The territory is intelligible,
has something to tell you,

853
00:54:11:02 --> 00:54:15:14
It has a narrative structure
that's the territory,

854
00:54:15:17 --> 00:54:19:12
something that has a narrative structure
whose pages are the floor.

855
00:54:20:10 --> 00:54:22:18
So these companies come in and say,

856
00:54:22:19 --> 00:54:25:26
here we lie down, we put a bulldozer,
there is no problem,

857
00:54:25:27 --> 00:54:30:09
we set up a tower
and they are tearing out the pages of a territory.

858
00:54:31:09 --> 00:54:31:24
So,

859
00:54:31:24 --> 00:54:34:25
They don't understand why they are thinking about money.

860
00:54:34:26 --> 00:54:39:23
These people want money, they are asking for a lot of money
and they reduce it to a matter of money.

861
00:54:39:24 --> 00:54:41:14
It is not a money issue.

862
00:54:41:15 --> 00:54:46:15
Obviously, money will have some time
to be addressed, but it is not the essential

863
00:54:46:16 --> 00:54:47:22
of the problem,

864
00:54:49:26 --> 00:55:08:00
not it

865
00:55:12:14 --> 00:55:13:05
is.

866
00:55:13:06 --> 00:55:15:23
So see the whole point,

867
00:55:15:24 --> 00:55:16:26
what's up

868
00:55:18:27 --> 00:55:21:23
where there is an ontological disconnection,

869
00:55:22:16 --> 00:55:25:05
For example, for companies

870
00:55:25:21 --> 00:55:28:21
The winds are a mass of hot air,

871
00:55:29:00 --> 00:55:33:10
geophysical events, inanimate,
that occur on earth

872
00:55:33:11 --> 00:55:38:19
and that can generate energy: for the wayuú,
They are beings that have paths,

873
00:55:38:28 --> 00:55:43:08
temperaments
and that they need to cross those paths.

874
00:55:43:09 --> 00:55:47:17
A wind moves,
He does not live in a place: passes through a place.

875
00:55:47:18 --> 00:55:51:23
And those paths are related to dreams,
They are related to something else.

876
00:55:52:05 --> 00:55:57:13
So how to understand the wind of business,
the wind from wind companies

877
00:55:57:23 --> 00:56:01:14
and the wayuú wind
They are two different worlds in the cosmos.

878
00:56:01:15 --> 00:56:03:12
They are different.

879
00:56:03:13 --> 00:56:06:10
To make those logics meet

880
00:56:06:25 --> 00:56:09:03
They are disputes about the universe,

881
00:56:09:20 --> 00:56:13:28
They are not disputes about development,
no, they are disputes about the universe.

882
00:56:13:29 --> 00:56:14:20
So,

883
00:56:15:18 --> 00:56:18:13
How to make them understand this?

884
00:56:18:25 --> 00:56:22:06
Generally the owners of the companies,
Investors are in a hurry

885
00:56:22:07 --> 00:56:25:21
they want to see their money
producing, the Wayuú have time

886
00:56:26:22 --> 00:56:28:27
and they want to talk about this

887
00:56:28:28 --> 00:56:31:07
and understand how this is not going to affect them.

888
00:56:31:19 --> 00:56:36:15
Then there is a disagreement
that, those do not understand

889
00:56:37:01 --> 00:56:39:18
and they don't want to understand.

890
00:56:39:19 --> 00:56:42:13
They don't want it, they see it as a whim, superstition.

891
00:56:42:14 --> 00:56:44:17
It's a backward thought,

892
00:56:44:18 --> 00:56:48:25
we are modernity,
We are the reason and all this.

893
00:56:49:07 --> 00:56:51:25
This is science, they are superstition.

894
00:56:52:16 --> 00:56:55:01
So there, in that disagreement about the

895
00:56:55:09 --> 00:56:59:09
the land, over the territory,
on the landscape, on the wind,

896
00:56:59:10 --> 00:57:03:05
about each tree that you are going to cut down and that was alive,

897
00:57:04:10 --> 00:57:06:29
that's where no, there hasn't been an agreement,

898
00:57:07:21 --> 00:57:10:19
there has not been an agreement.

899
00:57:10:27 --> 00:57:14:15
As practically in theory,
That cannot be resolved

900
00:57:14:16 --> 00:57:17:07
that, I don't know, maybe there isn't one.

901
00:57:17:13 --> 00:57:20:05
Of course, those are points to understand.

902
00:57:21:25 --> 00:57:24:16
We would have to see how they dialogue, how they converse.

903
00:57:24:17 --> 00:57:27:19
It is always good to talk,
You cannot deny dialogue.

904
00:57:27:28 --> 00:57:30:07
You have to think about

905
00:57:31:15 --> 00:57:34:23
the others, understand each other, sit down, talk

906
00:57:34:27 --> 00:57:38:26
and if one can express that

907
00:57:38:27 --> 00:57:42:00
But, let's see how it turns out,

908
00:57:42:01 --> 00:57:44:22
I think that's why the president is coming from. Hopefully
He will achieve it.

909
00:57:44:23 --> 00:57:47:04
I don't know how he will do it.

910
00:57:47:05 --> 00:57:52:18
I think that
literally spending time in the territory

911
00:57:52:24 --> 00:57:56:15
out there in a hammock,
the president there with the mosquitoes,

912
00:57:57:16 --> 00:58:01:20
with the winds here, telling them,
I think that would help a lot.

913
00:58:01:21 --> 00:58:06:04
Yes, it helps, of course, he's coming to stay here for a week, a week.

914
00:58:06:08 --> 00:58:08:15
I was thinking, and I know that

915
00:58:09:15 --> 00:58:11:27
this is not the point,

916
00:58:12:05 --> 00:58:15:18
is that it is an ontological and

917
00:58:16:19 --> 00:58:17:25
cosmology more than anything,

918
00:58:17:25 --> 00:58:21:12
but I was also thinking, so yeah,

919
00:58:21:13 --> 00:58:24:16
I come from that scientific ontology, although yes

920
00:58:25:04 --> 00:58:28:07
I'm very involved in that other thing, but maybe also

921
00:58:29:03 --> 00:58:34:24
the winds, that is,
If one would put a mill or anything and

922
00:58:36:16 --> 00:58:37:12
changes.

923
00:58:37:12 --> 00:58:39:16
I mean, that changes the wind.

924
00:58:40:01 --> 00:58:42:29
If we are in a semi-desert place, right?

925
00:58:43:00 --> 00:58:44:04
Yes it is.

926
00:58:44:05 --> 00:58:47:03
and the winds bring water, they bring humidity

927
00:58:47:16 --> 00:58:53:20
and a single, a small change
maybe it could bring down the entire environment.

928
00:58:53:21 --> 00:58:56:00
So beyond something like that

929
00:58:56:01 --> 00:58:58:03
Of course, the Wayuú already say it

930
00:58:58:12 --> 00:58:59:27
is one thing we don't know.

931
00:59:00:06 --> 00:59:04:20
Why the importance of studies on this,
How does this affect birds?

932
00:59:05:08 --> 00:59:08:22
how it affects bats that it also affects them
the,

933
00:59:09:04 --> 00:59:11:28
the blades of wind energy

934
00:59:12:20 --> 00:59:14:23
How does it affect the eyesight of human beings?

935
00:59:14:24 --> 00:59:16:25
How does it affect the sound they generate?

936
00:59:16:26 --> 00:59:19:20
Because they generate a low frequency sound, I think,

937
00:59:19:29 --> 00:59:24:03
But it has an impact either way.
The electrical conduction lines,

938
00:59:24:04 --> 00:59:28:08
that energy must be released,
that energy can’t be isolated, they have to come out

939
00:59:28:09 --> 00:59:33:00
by electrical conduction lines
which also generate white smog and energy fields.

940
00:59:33:10 --> 00:59:37:11
And we must deforest and make roads
to get those lines out.

941
00:59:37:21 --> 00:59:41:01
And there will be many people passing by in cars.

942
00:59:41:15 --> 00:59:45:07
where before it was quiet
and the Wayuú really like their tranquility.

943
00:59:45:25 --> 00:59:49:16
They go out for a walk every day

944
00:59:49:17 --> 00:59:52:29
and they see a footprint, a shoe and they know who stepped on it.

945
00:59:53:25 --> 00:59:57:07
They know how their children walk, the neighbors,

946
00:59:58:22 --> 01:00:00:04
They know the…

947
01:00:00:04 --> 01:00:05:02
The Wayuú have some flip flops, the waireñas, do you know them?
Wayuú footwear and that Wayuú footwear,

948
01:00:05:03 --> 01:00:07:15
Well, they are specialists in tracking footprints.

949
01:00:08:01 --> 01:00:10:10
That has been his ancient profession.

950
01:00:11:16 --> 01:00:13:24
When a deer or a thing,

951
01:00:13:25 --> 01:00:18:25
and they also track human footprints
and they know if I walk and tilt my foot when walking

952
01:00:18:26 --> 01:00:21:28
to the left, they say ah, there goes so and so,

953
01:00:21:29 --> 01:00:25:17
because he always walks like that and they know him.

954
01:00:25:18 --> 01:00:29:21
But then they are going to lose that territorial control
because many people are going to pass by

955
01:00:29:22 --> 01:00:33:09
strange vehicles, with strange people
who is not indigenous and

956
01:00:33:19 --> 01:00:37:27
your sense of security, well-being,
will also be affected,

957
01:00:38:08 --> 01:00:39:26
So we have to see all of that.

958
01:00:39:26 --> 01:00:43:24
On the other hand,
The Wayuú have needs for health, water,

959
01:00:44:09 --> 01:00:48:03
of productive projects to live their economy.

960
01:00:48:21 --> 01:00:49:28
I don't know what the meeting will be like,

961
01:00:49:28 --> 01:00:53:23
there will be a dialogue,
I imagine it, and we have to see how that dialogue takes place.

962
01:00:54:10 --> 01:00:55:24
Yes, yes,

963
01:00:57:02 --> 01:01:00:08
you know,

964
01:01:01:06 --> 01:01:02:08
It's going to be interesting.

965
01:01:02:09 --> 01:01:03:10
That's how it is.

966
01:01:03:10 --> 01:01:06:13
That makes me happy. The president is coming.

967
01:01:06:14 --> 01:01:12:09
I was living in Popayán
in 2018 and 2019

968
01:01:12:23 --> 01:01:15:16
and there were these big protests

969
01:01:15:29 --> 01:01:17:13
and yes,

970
01:01:17:14 --> 01:01:18:14
was very hard.

971
01:01:18:15 --> 01:01:20:21
Hard and things

972
01:01:20:22 --> 01:01:25:26
I think Duque would just have to go talk and that's it,

973
01:01:26:07 --> 01:01:30:02
but promise, promise and it never came.

974
01:01:30:14 --> 01:01:32:26
and they asked him to come.

975
01:01:32:27 --> 01:01:35:01
and it was just a dialogue.

976
01:01:36:07 --> 01:01:37:29
and Petro came this time

977
01:01:38:00 --> 01:01:39:00
for own will.

978
01:01:39:01 --> 01:01:41:02
He said he wanted to come to work for a week.

979
01:01:41:03 --> 01:01:44:14
Well, let's see what comes of all this,
because the idea

980
01:01:44:15 --> 01:01:47:16
It is seeing what results, what is achieved.

981
01:01:47:17 --> 01:01:49:01
We'll see.

982
01:01:49:01 --> 01:01:51:10
But it is interesting. No?
Are you going to talk to him too?

983
01:01:52:22 --> 01:01:54:29
No, I prefer to keep distance from power.

984
01:01:55:00 --> 01:01:58:20
I prefer to read the news

985
01:01:59:24 --> 01:02:02:02
They called me from El tiempo (Newspaper),

986
01:02:02:03 --> 01:02:07:06
and they called me yesterday from the newspaper
Time and what do you think and then they ask me

987
01:02:07:07 --> 01:02:08:24
Are you a leader?

988
01:02:08:25 --> 01:02:12:05
Are you a defender of human rights?
Are you an indigenous authority? I told them

989
01:02:12:06 --> 01:02:15:03
I am a solitary voice, I do not represent anyone.

990
01:02:15:06 --> 01:02:16:03
To anyone.

991
01:02:16:18 --> 01:02:17:05
What I speak,

992
01:02:17:05 --> 01:02:19:23
I'll say it for myself, I don't even know if my children listen to me.

993
01:02:21:04 --> 01:02:22:05
I told them.

994
01:02:23:02 --> 01:02:25:06
I am not and I do not want to be

995
01:02:25:07 --> 01:02:27:05
leader, nor leader, nor...

996
01:02:27:05 --> 01:02:29:09
It's a lot of responsibility.

997
01:02:29:10 --> 01:02:33:21
One has enough with one's own life
as to lead another's.

998
01:02:37:28 --> 01:02:39:10
There are some who

999
01:02:39:29 --> 01:02:44:01
bring knowledge, there are others who bring leadership.

1000
01:02:44:02 --> 01:02:48:04
You have your role.

1001
01:02:48:24 --> 01:02:50:19
His role and his role.

1002
01:02:50:20 --> 01:02:53:12
Yes, that's the idea.

1003
01:02:53:13 --> 01:02:58:20
I wanted to talk to you a little about knowing more,
because well, all that, several of those topics

1004
01:02:58:21 --> 01:03:02:10
I think
We are going to talk more on Tuesday, but about that,

1005
01:03:04:20 --> 01:03:06:16
from that lineage of

1006
01:03:06:17 --> 01:03:10:12
the Wayuú people, of course, are very interesting, what is it about that?

1007
01:03:10:13 --> 01:03:13:22
Very interesting,
because the Wayuú kinship system

1008
01:03:14:03 --> 01:03:16:24
It is based on the theory of human procreation.

1009
01:03:17:13 --> 01:03:19:20
When a man and a woman have sex,

1010
01:03:20:04 --> 01:03:23:06
The man contributes with blood,

1011
01:03:23:22 --> 01:03:26:27
the vital blood that causes the child,
semen turns to blood.

1012
01:03:27:22 --> 01:03:30:06
Then the woman provides the meat,

1013
01:03:30:07 --> 01:03:33:28
the body wrap
where the child is born, the womb.

1014
01:03:34:01 --> 01:03:36:24
So,
When a person is born, they have two families,

1015
01:03:37:23 --> 01:03:40:05
a Oupayu, a father's maternal family

1016
01:03:40:18 --> 01:03:45:12
and the apushi which is the mother's maternal family, then,

1017
01:03:47:01 --> 01:03:49:09
This is legally important.

1018
01:03:49:10 --> 01:03:52:06
If I cause a wound to a Wayuú, I will shoot him,

1019
01:03:52:07 --> 01:03:55:29
I don't kill him, the father collects the blood shed,

1020
01:03:56:17 --> 01:04:01:05
but if I kill it, as flesh is destroyed,
the body,

1021
01:04:01:06 --> 01:04:04:28
then the mother's family is going to come and ask

1022
01:04:05:02 --> 01:04:07:26
the great compensation for the destruction of the flesh.

1023
01:04:08:09 --> 01:04:11:08
The father can only ask
a small payment of tears.

1024
01:04:11:09 --> 01:04:13:03
What he has cried, his pain for his son.

1025
01:04:13:03 --> 01:04:18:07
Then the Father is given compensation
for the little tears and He leaves.

1026
01:04:18:15 --> 01:04:21:21
And then the big strong negotiation
It's with the mother's family.

1027
01:04:22:08 --> 01:04:25:04
So the lands, the territory,

1028
01:04:25:25 --> 01:04:31:00
the clan, practically like one's last name
It's the mom's, it's not the dad's,

1029
01:04:31:17 --> 01:04:34:09
So a Wayuú will always have an orientation

1030
01:04:34:10 --> 01:04:39:12
stronger towards your uterine family
that towards the father's uterine family,

1031
01:04:39:22 --> 01:04:43:27
that is, the mother,
because the father is a boss for minor things,

1032
01:04:44:17 --> 01:04:48:09
the father is a boss in the home,
food, food, education.

1033
01:04:48:19 --> 01:04:51:22
But when a problem is strong,
He is your mother's brother,

1034
01:04:51:23 --> 01:04:54:11
It's your uncle who is your real boss.

1035
01:04:54:27 --> 01:04:59:00
That's the boss,
because he is the one who must intervene.

1036
01:04:59:01 --> 01:05:01:08
If I do something, they look for my uncle, my dad

1037
01:05:01:09 --> 01:05:03:28
no, no, because he is almost a stranger.

1038
01:05:03:29 --> 01:05:05:29
I mean, it's not from the same group.

1039
01:05:06:14 --> 01:05:10:10
On the other hand, the lands that belong to my mother,
where my uncles live,

1040
01:05:10:22 --> 01:05:13:20
the defense, the cemetery,
everything is a function of the mother.

1041
01:05:14:09 --> 01:05:17:24
So, the Wayuú society is matrilineal,
It is oriented towards that.

1042
01:05:18:06 --> 01:05:20:18
The father does have some duties in marriage,

1043
01:05:20:23 --> 01:05:24:04
injuries, these things, and he has a role at a minor level,

1044
01:05:24:19 --> 01:05:28:11
well, yes, provide the house with food,
everything any father in the world would do.

1045
01:05:28:23 --> 01:05:31:03
But when the problem is serious, he is out.

1046
01:05:31:04 --> 01:05:33:00
No, it can't be.

1047
01:05:33:01 --> 01:05:36:06
He is his brother-in-law, he is his mother's brother,

1048
01:05:36:07 --> 01:05:40:04
the one who is the boss of his nephews,
it's stronger,

1049
01:05:40:05 --> 01:05:43:02
the uncle nephew father and son relationship.
Really?

1050
01:05:43:21 --> 01:05:45:06
Of course, of course.

1051
01:05:45:07 --> 01:05:45:29
Interesting.

1052
01:05:45:29 --> 01:05:49:12
Yes, a Wayuú has to talk about who
They were your uncles and then,

1053
01:05:50:13 --> 01:05:51:12
in fact,

1054
01:05:51:12 --> 01:05:53:04
to the uncles, they call the Wayú Ta’laüla

1055
01:05:53:05 --> 01:05:54:28
I mean, my old man, my boss.

1056
01:05:54:29 --> 01:05:57:09
That's my uncle. That's how it is said.

1057
01:05:57:25 --> 01:05:59:08
It is a very close relationship.

1058
01:05:59:08 --> 01:06:01:19
And in war always fighting

1059
01:06:01:20 --> 01:06:04:21
Uncle’s side.

1060
01:06:05:03 --> 01:06:06:21
Even if the father's family

1061
01:06:06:21 --> 01:06:10:23
goes to war with the mother's family,
The Wayuú must take their mother's side,

1062
01:06:10:24 --> 01:06:13:13
necessarily on that side.

1063
01:06:15:07 --> 01:06:19:19
There is a story in a Wayuú song of a war that took place,

1064
01:06:20:25 --> 01:06:25:11
They loved their father very much, these Wayuú,
and for some reason the families went to war,

1065
01:06:25:12 --> 01:06:29:03
that these are long families,
and the father died in combat

1066
01:06:29:23 --> 01:06:32:02
and they asked permission to the enemies

1067
01:06:32:03 --> 01:06:34:28
to go cry to their father and they accepted them.

1068
01:06:35:07 --> 01:06:38:04
Then they said let's make a truce
so that you can come to cry at your

1069
01:06:38:05 --> 01:06:38:22
Dad because he was

1070
01:06:38:22 --> 01:06:42:11
their dad and peace came because of that, so it's a story

1071
01:06:42:27 --> 01:06:46:10
very cute.

1072
01:06:46:20 --> 01:06:49:23
So this must be understood,
Companies do not understand this,

1073
01:06:50:12 --> 01:06:55:16
They don't understand this, they don't understand
this form of kinship and they are, and why?

1074
01:06:55:17 --> 01:06:59:05
what is this? And your last name? and not.

1075
01:07:01:01 --> 01:07:02:22
This is how the network is woven,

1076
01:07:02:23 --> 01:07:06:05
wayuú social organization
and that has to do with the land.

1077
01:07:06:14 --> 01:07:10:00
The earth is feminine, the earth is feminine,

1078
01:07:10:01 --> 01:07:14:18
the rain, the rain that fertilizes
the earth is hyper masculine.

1079
01:07:15:05 --> 01:07:18:05
So rain is the most masculine thing there can be,

1080
01:07:18:16 --> 01:07:21:06
because it is what fertilizes the earth, the earth is what

1081
01:07:21:25 --> 01:07:24:09
what bears, what is fruitful, what is fertile.

1082
01:07:24:23 --> 01:07:29:01
The earth is life,
but the masculine is what fertilizes life.

1083
01:07:29:10 --> 01:07:33:00
Then look at all that beautiful relationship
that must be understood.

1084
01:07:33:21 --> 01:07:36:13
So for them the earth is fixed,

1085
01:07:37:14 --> 01:07:41:11
This is a place, but the rain is mobile,
the rain is watered

1086
01:07:42:02 --> 01:07:45:21
and fertilizes the earth, the lands in plural,

1087
01:07:45:22 --> 01:07:49:10
the lands, because each woman is a land.

1088
01:07:50:03 --> 01:07:54:11
Yes, each territory
It has its own history, its own place,

1089
01:07:54:24 --> 01:07:59:21
then more than the earth as a unit
that does exist at a mythological level, it is called Mma.

1090
01:08:00:03 --> 01:08:04:01
There are also
specific lands or places

1091
01:08:04:20 --> 01:08:09:13
to which one is associated
and that are represented in the cemetery housing axis.

1092
01:08:09:15 --> 01:08:13:19
This is why cemeteries are so important.
and that's why Vito's poem says

1093
01:08:13:20 --> 01:08:15:26
what he said, there is your shadow and you rest.

1094
01:08:16:01 --> 01:08:21:10
You can leave and you can not come back,
but there is the tree in your cemetery.

1095
01:08:21:11 --> 01:08:22:03
In wayaqui apushi

1096
01:08:24:20 --> 01:08:26:12
Yes, apushi.

1097
01:08:26:13 --> 01:08:30:09
Yes, apushi is relatives, it is like part,

1098
01:08:30:17 --> 01:08:33:17
It's part uterine relative, yes,

1099
01:08:33:20 --> 01:08:37:22
but a nest is like the family unit, not the clan.

1100
01:08:37:23 --> 01:08:40:06
The clan is called E´iruku and clan means meat.

1101
01:08:41:07 --> 01:08:44:25
Not all members of a clan are family.

1102
01:08:45:11 --> 01:08:46:17
They are like surnames.

1103
01:08:46:18 --> 01:08:49:12
Like someone's last name is Smith.

1104
01:08:49:21 --> 01:08:53:10
There are many Smiths in the world, but those who were born in

1105
01:08:53:16 --> 01:08:56:20
Cabo de la Vela
They are one and the ones who are in such a place.

1106
01:08:56:21 --> 01:09:00:19
So when the land serves as your last name
and you say no,

1107
01:09:00:27 --> 01:09:03:18
I am Uriana from xxxxx

1108
01:09:04:18 --> 01:09:07:21
a Wayuú place called like that,
that has a cemetery,

1109
01:09:07:22 --> 01:09:10:14
a source of water, a territory, a history.

1110
01:09:10:24 --> 01:09:15:22
It is then, that one is different, those do act in war.
The others can be recognized, Ah!

1111
01:09:15:23 --> 01:09:20:10
We share the clan, but we are not family,
we only have an mythological relationship

1112
01:09:21:14 --> 01:09:24:04
and the clan not only of humans.

1113
01:09:24:29 --> 01:09:27:03
The clan involves non-humans,

1114
01:09:28:21 --> 01:09:31:28
because for example

1115
01:09:31:29 --> 01:09:35:23
well, the Uriana ones are from the jaguar and the rabbit,

1116
01:09:37:01 --> 01:09:39:16
They are animals that belong to the clan.

1117
01:09:40:02 --> 01:09:42:29
Some hills and some trees.

1118
01:09:43:00 --> 01:09:48:04
The trees are numerous as is a numerous clan,
The trees that are numerous are from that clan.

1119
01:09:48:22 --> 01:09:53:04
So there are humans, animals and plants
and even hills in one of this clans.

1120
01:09:54:04 --> 01:09:58:17
Well that, that's what you're talking about,
that everything was human.

1121
01:09:58:19 --> 01:09:59:12
Everything was human.

1122
01:09:59:13 --> 01:10:02:04
That's where the kinship comes from, that in time,

1123
01:10:02:15 --> 01:10:05:22
in the reference time,

1124
01:10:05:23 --> 01:10:08:19
Australians have a time called
The Age of Dream

1125
01:10:09:24 --> 01:10:14:08
and the Coyoacán of Alaska
They have a time called distant time.

1126
01:10:14:09 --> 01:10:18:07
The Wayuú call that time wayuu sumaiwa,

1127
01:10:18:23 --> 01:10:21:06
sumaiwa, at one time,

1128
01:10:21:20 --> 01:10:27:04
but in the West we tend to confuse that time
with the past, because stories begin like that.

1129
01:10:27:05 --> 01:10:30:20
There was a time
and people think it's the past, it's not the past.

1130
01:10:30:21 --> 01:10:34:13
They are transhistorical times that go through history.

1131
01:10:36:03 --> 01:10:37:15
Native populance

1132
01:10:37:15 --> 01:10:40:17
they can have notions of time
where the past is ahead

1133
01:10:41:21 --> 01:10:46:08
or a mythical time until
forward, forward time or parallel times.

1134
01:10:46:19 --> 01:10:50:14
And how do you do it between everyday time
and that time?

1135
01:10:50:21 --> 01:10:55:09
Through dream, ritual and landscape.

1136
01:10:55:10 --> 01:10:58:12
That's what makes those time levels
become accessible

1137
01:10:58:13 --> 01:11:02:05
at the current time,
that young people can meet those things.

1138
01:11:02:06 --> 01:11:07:02
So to understand the person in the world
Wayuú, to understand the territories,

1139
01:11:07:03 --> 01:11:10:17
to understand living beings,
everything is explained in time.

1140
01:11:11:25 --> 01:11:15:19
So

1141
01:11:15:20 --> 01:11:18:16
Yes, a Wayuú, he dies like today,

1142
01:11:19:15 --> 01:11:22:06
that Wayuú himself is going to convert

1143
01:11:22:08 --> 01:11:26:08
on a tree or a hill or whatever, or…

1144
01:11:27:08 --> 01:11:30:03
He first takes a trip through the Milky Way,

1145
01:11:31:13 --> 01:11:35:08
a long trip and you arrive at Jepira, another world.

1146
01:11:35:23 --> 01:11:39:23
He will arrive there with his cattle,
the one who was killed at his wake,

1147
01:11:40:12 --> 01:11:44:11
the souls of sacrificed animals
at the wake, goats, cows,

1148
01:11:44:12 --> 01:11:46:09
sheep, accompany him.

1149
01:11:46:10 --> 01:11:48:14
He needs those cattle to live there

1150
01:11:49:04 --> 01:11:51:15
and wants to maintain the status he had

1151
01:11:51:16 --> 01:11:54:17
here, he wants to keep it there.

1152
01:11:54:18 --> 01:11:56:28
After a while,

1153
01:11:57:01 --> 01:11:59:03
his soul begins to dilute,

1154
01:11:59:04 --> 01:12:01:19
begins to lose like life within death

1155
01:12:02:12 --> 01:12:04:21
and comes back like rain

1156
01:12:04:22 --> 01:12:07:27
to start a life cycle and all this

1157
01:12:07:28 --> 01:12:11:05
kind of things.

1158
01:12:11:07 --> 01:12:14:06
But, the kinship we have with plants,

1159
01:12:14:19 --> 01:12:19:00
with animals, it comes from human traits
and from that mythical time when they were human.

1160
01:12:19:07 --> 01:12:21:06
That's why they are cosmic relatives.

1161
01:12:21:07 --> 01:12:23:29
Are they all cosmic relatives, are they different

1162
01:12:25:04 --> 01:12:28:01
practically what humans today?

1163
01:12:28:21 --> 01:12:33:02
If today's humans have an advantage
that were not transformed,

1164
01:12:33:03 --> 01:12:36:19
preserve appearance and language
that they had at that time.

1165
01:12:37:06 --> 01:12:39:15
Humans are the only untransformed beings.

1166
01:12:39:23 --> 01:12:41:18
They transformed into other humans.

1167
01:12:41:19 --> 01:12:44:23
Horses are fallen humans, ex-humans,

1168
01:12:45:17 --> 01:12:48:21
but we are the only beings
not transformed.

1169
01:12:49:08 --> 01:12:53:00
We remain as if in time itself.

1170
01:12:58:02 --> 01:12:59:21
That was my doctoral thesis.

1171
01:12:59:22 --> 01:13:01:26
If we read a little about that.

1172
01:13:01:27 --> 01:13:04:01
Ontology.
is a big thesis.

1173
01:13:04:02 --> 01:13:06:09
I wrote it in Canada, among other things.

1174
01:13:06:10 --> 01:13:07:02
Really?

1175
01:13:07:08 --> 01:13:11:19
It's funny because, well,
our Peru documentary just won

1176
01:13:12:02 --> 01:13:17:19
best documentary of a Canadian film festival
and they are going to bring me there

1177
01:13:17:23 --> 01:13:21:07
July 14.
¿
Where in?

1178
01:13:21:08 --> 01:13:24:19
At xxxx, at the lake

1179
01:13:25:09 --> 01:13:26:00
Ont.

1180
01:13:26:00 --> 01:13:32:03
I was in Ontario, I was in there,
There I was touring all those territories.

1181
01:13:32:04 --> 01:13:33:17
How beautiful the big lakes are there.

1182
01:13:33:17 --> 01:13:38:25
There is a lake in xxxx that is bigger than La Guajira

1183
01:13:38:26 --> 01:13:40:27
24,0000 thousand kilometers.

1184
01:13:40:28 --> 01:13:42:00
We toured it,

1185
01:13:42:00 --> 01:13:43:00
well, not everything.

1186
01:13:43:01 --> 01:13:46:09
I was with the communities
indigenous. There is an indigenous

1187
01:13:47:12 --> 01:13:48:26
geologist, has a Ph.D.

1188
01:13:48:27 --> 01:13:52:22
in geology and in general very, very prepared

1189
01:13:52:23 --> 01:13:56:18
all the leaders,
but I knew pollution problems from Mercury.

1190
01:13:57:06 --> 01:14:02:18
We were in an area called Grassi Narrow.

1191
01:14:02:19 --> 01:14:03:28
There, there I was.

1192
01:14:03:28 --> 01:14:06:09
I have photos there.

1193
01:14:07:03 --> 01:14:09:07
Well there were cold days,

1194
01:14:09:08 --> 01:14:12:23
terribly cold.

1195
01:14:12:24 --> 01:14:13:16
started to enter

1196
01:14:13:16 --> 01:14:16:19
After the heat, I saw dams.

1197
01:14:17:09 --> 01:14:20:26
We met, we worked on common problems.

1198
01:14:20:27 --> 01:14:22:26
I brought water from the ranchería.

1199
01:14:22:27 --> 01:14:24:06
From the River here.

1200
01:14:24:07 --> 01:14:26:09
And we watered it there in Lake Ontario

1201
01:14:26:10 --> 01:14:28:24
and they had brought water here from Ontario

1202
01:14:28:25 --> 01:14:30:26
and we had watered it
here in Riohacha, there in the ranchería.

1203
01:14:30:27 --> 01:14:31:26
It's called Exchange

1204
01:14:31:26 --> 01:14:35:22
of water.

1205
01:14:36:03 --> 01:14:37:27
I love Canada.

1206
01:14:37:28 --> 01:14:41:04
Yeah, well, I'm from there, from Ohio.

1207
01:14:41:05 --> 01:14:43:02
It's close, there in front.

1208
01:14:43:03 --> 01:14:46:28
And we crossed the border and Lake Iris is my lake.

1209
01:14:46:29 --> 01:14:49:01
I mean, yes, the government here.

1210
01:14:59:13 --> 01:15:02:22
We toured

1211
01:15:02:23 --> 01:15:05:16
by boat seeing other lakes

1212
01:15:05:28 --> 01:15:10:12
drawings, hieroglyphs that are there in areas.

1213
01:15:13:11 --> 01:15:15:14
Look, here I am with an indigenous Canadian

1214
01:15:16:20 --> 01:15:17:07
there,

1215
01:15:17:08 --> 01:15:19:02
that

1216
01:15:20:12 --> 01:15:22:19
It's in a camp.

1217
01:15:23:08 --> 01:15:28:17
Very dear, her name is Leona
and this is touring the mountains.

1218
01:15:28:18 --> 01:15:29:27
The mountains in Canada.

1219
01:15:35:18 --> 01:15:39:21
And we sleep with firewood and it's cold at night.

1220
01:15:39:22 --> 01:15:40:29
Look here we go

1221
01:15:41:00 --> 01:15:42:11
touring the lake.

1222
01:15:42:12 --> 01:15:44:18
What the lake

1223
01:15:45:01 --> 01:15:48:00
that the overcrowded
there where they have the pollution problem.

1224
01:15:48:12 --> 01:15:52:02
This is in Winnipeg we were seeing the rivers,

1225
01:15:52:03 --> 01:15:54:10
the rivers. AND.

1226
01:15:55:05 --> 01:15:56:08
All that.

1227
01:15:56:09 --> 01:15:58:21
Ah, look, here in monuments then.

1228
01:15:59:06 --> 01:16:01:27
Oh, they are a beautiful monument of.

1229
01:16:01:28 --> 01:16:04:05
The indigenous people there.

1230
01:16:04:06 --> 01:16:07:12
And what organization was that?

1231
01:16:07:13 --> 01:16:10:00
That those are the indigenous people you were watching.

1232
01:16:10:01 --> 01:16:13:27
Is that so? Yeah.

1233
01:16:13:28 --> 01:16:14:13
Let me see.

1234
01:16:14:13 --> 01:16:18:07
I'm going to bring it here.

1235
01:16:18:08 --> 01:16:18:24
And they say

1236
01:16:20:11 --> 01:16:22:22
Oh, more than

1237
01:16:28:14 --> 01:16:33:06
that is. Oh,

1238
01:16:34:11 --> 01:16:38:27
from there you come out

1239
01:16:40:15 --> 01:16:42:22
This was the bank of a river.

1240
01:16:42:26 --> 01:16:44:12
On time. On time.

1241
01:16:44:13 --> 01:16:47:18
It was about two hours from Winnipeg.

1242
01:16:47:27 --> 01:16:50:09
and it arrived

1243
01:16:50:10 --> 01:16:50:26
for.

1244
01:16:50:27 --> 01:16:55:09
Do something.

1245
01:16:55:10 --> 01:16:59:07
They already saw it

1246
01:16:59:08 --> 01:17:01:18
the first

1247
01:17:03:11 --> 01:17:04:00
years?

1248
01:17:04:11 --> 01:17:06:23
Yes, Yes. This was good.

1249
01:17:06:24 --> 01:17:09:23
A beautiful tour in the.

1250
01:17:09:24 --> 01:17:11:28
Lagos, throughout that area.

1251
01:17:12:17 --> 01:17:15:05
Yes. And I loved this.

1252
01:17:16:07 --> 01:17:18:00
I took one. Photo.

1253
01:17:18:01 --> 01:17:22:01
in a sculpture
which has books by indigenous authors.

1254
01:17:23:15 --> 01:17:25:03
It's called Education

1255
01:17:25:03 --> 01:17:28:07
is the new horizon.

1256
01:17:28:08 --> 01:17:31:08
All these books are by indigenous authors,
those who are there.

1257
01:17:31:21 --> 01:17:34:29
And I loved the motto
Education is the new horizon.

1258
01:17:35:06 --> 01:17:38:17
Yes it is a good name
Yes it is very

1259
01:17:38:18 --> 01:17:40:28
Nice experience in Canada.

1260
01:17:40:29 --> 01:17:44:06
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, with everyone.

1261
01:17:45:05 --> 01:17:46:09
the problems, the

1262
01:17:46:09 --> 01:17:48:18
Beautiful things and landscapes

1263
01:17:49:18 --> 01:17:50:19
and monuments

1264
01:17:50:19 --> 01:17:54:27
to indigenous people, to indigenous women
that are lost, there are also dramas,

1265
01:17:55:02 --> 01:17:59:25
the boarding schools, the children who were lost
in church boarding schools,

1266
01:18:01:03 --> 01:18:02:28
thousands of children, thousands.

1267
01:18:02:29 --> 01:18:04:19
Changed.

1268
01:18:04:20 --> 01:18:07:10
For the Wayuú have influenced them,

1269
01:18:07:22 --> 01:18:11:01
in the sense that when Covid,

1270
01:18:11:02 --> 01:18:15:15
hospitals began to cremate
the bodies of Wayuú women and our bodies

1271
01:18:15:16 --> 01:18:19:17
They are sacred, they have to go to the cemetery
because they are going to be cremated and they dressed in red

1272
01:18:19:18 --> 01:18:24:15
To deny death, women dressed in
red and they made a march dressed in red.

1273
01:18:24:16 --> 01:18:30:13
Well, they took the red of the Wayuú to
also protest for missing women.

1274
01:18:30:28 --> 01:18:36:16
Then look how it influenced
one thing influenced others,
trans American?

1275
01:18:36:21 --> 01:18:38:26
Yes, yes, yes, that's right.

1276
01:18:38:29 --> 01:18:40:25
This is the Winnipeg Human Rights Museum.

1277
01:18:40:25 --> 01:18:41:23
Which is beautiful.

1278
01:18:41:23 --> 01:18:43:25
Here I am in Winnipeg.

1279
01:18:43:26 --> 01:18:47:15
That's the museum.
Yes Yes.

1280
01:18:49:29 --> 01:18:52:16
Oh yeah?

1281
01:18:52:17 --> 01:18:53:28
Then no?

1282
01:18:53:29 --> 01:18:56:28
Well I see. That the idea is there.

1283
01:18:57:06 --> 01:19:00:08
The stories are there,

1284
01:19:00:09 --> 01:19:02:21
they are on Earth

1285
01:19:04:17 --> 01:19:06:28
to make a documentary about the Wayuú land.

1286
01:19:06:29 --> 01:19:12:06
It implies all this that we have talked about,
I don't know, seeing her as a non-perfect being.

1287
01:19:12:16 --> 01:19:15:05
Not perfect. Mysterious.

1288
01:19:15:15 --> 01:19:18:27
And that mystery of the land that the Wayuú say

1289
01:19:19:16 --> 01:19:22:15
entails the transformation of all beings
that we inhabit it

1290
01:19:23:21 --> 01:19:26:00
and reflects the idea that life

1291
01:19:26:17 --> 01:19:28:19
It is a product of the intention of the place.

1292
01:19:29:25 --> 01:19:31:22
Yes, life itself

1293
01:19:31:23 --> 01:19:35:00
It is that product of intention
of a place where we live.

1294
01:19:35:27 --> 01:19:40:05
And his relationship with his sister the sea,

1295
01:19:41:03 --> 01:19:43:21
that is angry,
He has a bit of a strong temperament.

1296
01:19:44:17 --> 01:19:48:05
and sometimes the two collide
and then she invades this one.

1297
01:19:49:02 --> 01:19:51:29
The sea comes in and invades the coast

1298
01:19:52:00 --> 01:19:57:25
and she has to take fire to make her retreat
to its shores and place of origin

1299
01:19:58:26 --> 01:20:00:02
through fire.

1300
01:20:00:03 --> 01:20:01:04
It's the only thing he's afraid of.

1301
01:20:01:04 --> 01:20:05:25
I see her, then she comes back,
It withdraws and returns to its shores, where it should be.

1302
01:20:06:25 --> 01:20:09:04
All of these are beautiful Wayuú stories.

1303
01:20:09:05 --> 01:20:14:27
Yes, very beautiful Wayuú stories.

1304
01:20:14:28 --> 01:20:20:08
Well, I think it's like a last
Question

Ready
and I think we should go.

1305
01:20:20:09 --> 01:20:25:26
But like that thing about the palabreros
which ones, who are they?

1306
01:20:25:27 --> 01:20:26:18
And well.

1307
01:20:26:19 --> 01:20:29:13
You don't know my book, The Dispute and the Word?

1308
01:20:30:03 --> 01:20:32:06
well, I haven't read it.

1309
01:20:32:29 --> 01:20:35:23
Yes, if you want to know about them you should read my book.

1310
01:20:35:24 --> 01:20:40:15
The dispute and the word, The law in the Wayuú society,
It was what I first investigated many years ago.

1311
01:20:41:03 --> 01:20:44:29
The palabreros are intermediaries

1312
01:20:46:16 --> 01:20:48:24
who manage the Wayuú normative system,

1313
01:20:49:05 --> 01:20:52:17
They are facilitators like “go between” and that figure

1314
01:20:52:28 --> 01:20:56:24
then they move
between a family, every damage

1315
01:20:58:09 --> 01:21:00:05
moral, an offense that I do to you

1316
01:21:00:06 --> 01:21:03:19
or any physical damage, a wound that I
cause you, all theft

1317
01:21:03:26 --> 01:21:06:05
What I do to you must be compensated.

1318
01:21:06:25 --> 01:21:12:06
The Wayuú do not believe in prison,
There is no corporal punishment, no, it is payment.

1319
01:21:12:22 --> 01:21:17:03
So that's not done directly.
and I don't charge you.

1320
01:21:17:04 --> 01:21:21:02
I send a person specialized in that,
in fixing,

1321
01:21:21:16 --> 01:21:25:05
to express my complaint
before your family gathered together.

1322
01:21:25:06 --> 01:21:28:25
It is not a problem between individuals,
No, it's between families.

1323
01:21:29:13 --> 01:21:33:27
The individual is not seen in isolation,
but immersed in a group of relatives.

1324
01:21:33:29 --> 01:21:39:20
So my problem is not with him,
It is against the entire group to which he belongs,

1325
01:21:40:00 --> 01:21:44:22
his brothers, sisters, uncles, maternal,
but uterine, maternal.

1326
01:21:45:19 --> 01:21:48:15
That is why it is so important
the concept of apushi among the Wayuú

1327
01:21:50:04 --> 01:21:51:08
and he goes,

1328
01:21:51:14 --> 01:21:55:04
He comes and goes, weaves peace between the parties.

1329
01:21:55:05 --> 01:22:00:10
That doesn't get solved right away.
That can take days, weeks.

1330
01:22:00:11 --> 01:22:05:16
sometimes they set up a meeting,
They come back and reach the agreement and that's it

1331
01:22:05:17 --> 01:22:08:07
when they achieve that there is a will to pay for the fault,

1332
01:22:08:20 --> 01:22:11:13
then they go in to see how much it is

1333
01:22:11:28 --> 01:22:15:08
and that is paid in animals, necklaces.

1334
01:22:15:29 --> 01:22:20:14
If it is a gun wound,
I must ask for the murder weapon.

1335
01:22:20:15 --> 01:22:22:17
If he was killed, that weapon

1336
01:22:22:18 --> 01:22:23:13
It must be delivered to me

1337
01:22:23:13 --> 01:22:27:15
first of all,
the weapon is the first thing that is requested

1338
01:22:27:16 --> 01:22:31:11
and it is the will of peace, hand over the weapon,
So they rule.

1339
01:22:31:12 --> 01:22:34:14
the weapon, it already means that they want peace
because they sent the weapon.

1340
01:22:34:15 --> 01:22:38:07
The weapon must be taken out of circulation
of the things of the world

1341
01:22:39:02 --> 01:22:41:05
because it hurts and has hurt.

1342
01:22:41:06 --> 01:22:45:27
It has something of the soul of the dead,
and the dead man has something of the weapon inside,

1343
01:22:46:09 --> 01:22:50:17
there is an exchange of substances,
then the payments are signed.

1344
01:22:50:18 --> 01:22:57:01
Some payments have no material meaning,
but of ornament, of aesthetics.

1345
01:22:57:02 --> 01:23:01:26
The necklace goes as an ornament, a luxury of payment.

1346
01:23:01:27 --> 01:23:07:01
They have the notion of luxury, which is luxury,
what is the decoration,

1347
01:23:07:02 --> 01:23:11:17
what is the aesthetic, the compensation
It doesn't have to be enough, it has to be beautiful.

1348
01:23:12:05 --> 01:23:14:26
The compensation is a necklace

1349
01:23:14:27 --> 01:23:17:05
and the necklace is made with cattle,

1350
01:23:17:06 --> 01:23:20:11
necklaces and strange animals like mules

1351
01:23:22:00 --> 01:23:23:08
Generally the Wayuú ask

1352
01:23:23:08 --> 01:23:25:17
two mules They can ask for 100 cows,

1353
01:23:26:21 --> 01:23:31:15
200 goats, 200 goats,
but the two mules are done like this,

1354
01:23:31:16 --> 01:23:36:03
because mules are hybrids that cannot be found
easily in the universe.

1355
01:23:36:04 --> 01:23:39:06
A horse and a mare or a donkey.

1356
01:23:39:07 --> 01:23:42:13
No, sorry,
a horse and a donkey, or a donkey and a mare.

1357
01:23:42:29 --> 01:23:48:01
Then the mules decorate the payment.

1358
01:23:48:02 --> 01:23:52:21
Two mules is not a large amount,
but since they are rare like necklaces,

1359
01:23:52:28 --> 01:23:55:21
They serve to decorate the payment,

1360
01:23:55:22 --> 01:23:59:00
So there I can deliver the 200 now

1361
01:23:59:19 --> 01:24:00:13
goats.

1362
01:24:00:14 --> 01:24:05:09
Or they give me deadlines,
because it's not about ruining the other,

1363
01:24:05:25 --> 01:24:08:13
but the other

1364
01:24:08:14 --> 01:24:10:14
Has to be prudent in their conduct.

1365
01:24:10:15 --> 01:24:13:19
And he tells you, I'm going to pay this this year.

1366
01:24:14:09 --> 01:24:18:21
and I will wait for my animals to reproduce
to be able to give you

1367
01:24:18:22 --> 01:24:23:24
the other year of the animals that were born this year
that the goats give birth up to three times,

1368
01:24:24:10 --> 01:24:28:24
then they deliver, and then the other
He does not want to destroy him nor does he want him to go to prison.

1369
01:24:28:25 --> 01:24:32:20
The Wayuú say what good is it to me that my enemy
be imprisoned

1370
01:24:33:02 --> 01:24:35:19
If there they are going to give you free food and free time?

1371
01:24:35:20 --> 01:24:40:24
I want him free to work
and pay me.

1372
01:24:40:25 --> 01:24:46:06
Then they go to jail,
They see it as something barbaric, uncivilized.

1373
01:24:46:23 --> 01:24:49:05
They have to say that prison is an uncivilized place.

1374
01:24:49:16 --> 01:24:53:29
and says because justice is not revenge,
justice is

1375
01:24:54:12 --> 01:24:57:03
reopen social relations

1376
01:24:57:27 --> 01:25:00:14
that were broken by someone's act.

1377
01:25:01:06 --> 01:25:02:04
Such as a theft.

1378
01:25:02:05 --> 01:25:04:25
Or a homicide, an injury, an offense.

1379
01:25:05:03 --> 01:25:08:07
So the Wayuú try to restore
like a fabric.

1380
01:25:08:22 --> 01:25:11:28
When I have a hole in a fabric and I pick up a needle

1381
01:25:12:25 --> 01:25:15:18
and I darn it again
so that the fabric is the same again.

1382
01:25:15:19 --> 01:25:18:23
This is Wayuú justice, it is restorative,

1383
01:25:19:02 --> 01:25:22:26
It is not punitive, it does not emphasize punishment
the penalty.

1384
01:25:22:27 --> 01:25:27:04
No!  emphasizes restoration
of broken social relationships.

1385
01:25:27:14 --> 01:25:32:05
The palabrero handles the rhetoric,
has to be persuasive.

1386
01:25:32:16 --> 01:25:38:01
Their task is to convince and a conflict is settled
when both win.

1387
01:25:38:26 --> 01:25:41:14
No one can feel bad.

1388
01:25:41:15 --> 01:25:46:01
If they pay me for a relative's injury,
My prestige remains intact.

1389
01:25:46:18 --> 01:25:47:21
I have made myself respected.

1390
01:25:48:20 --> 01:25:49:28
If I pay

1391
01:25:49:29 --> 01:25:55:03
what a relative did, the other family says,
They know how to pay.

1392
01:25:55:16 --> 01:25:57:09
Their young people can make a mistake.

1393
01:25:57:09 --> 01:26:00:27
But these people have responsible behavior,
Serious.

1394
01:26:01:06 --> 01:26:02:26
They are good people.

1395
01:26:02:27 --> 01:26:06:14
If something happens to me later, to a family member of mine

1396
01:26:07:19 --> 01:26:11:04
It is said that they are going to pay me because I am used to
pay for the faults.

1397
01:26:11:05 --> 01:26:14:26
Then I keep a collective resume,
not of the individual, but of the family.

1398
01:26:15:10 --> 01:26:19:29
And that resume
He says if, on the other hand, I don't pay, I don't fix it,

1399
01:26:20:09 --> 01:26:24:11
I put myself outside the Wayuú law, there is no police,
There are no judges, there is no problem.

1400
01:26:24:29 --> 01:26:28:03
But someone more powerful than me comes, runs over me

1401
01:26:28:23 --> 01:26:32:06
and I try to pay and they tell me, whoever doesn't know how to pay

1402
01:26:32:07 --> 01:26:36:12
should not charge,
because you humiliated a humble indigenous person

1403
01:26:36:13 --> 01:26:41:17
long ago, I was a fisherman perhaps
and you ran over him and did nothing.

1404
01:26:41:18 --> 01:26:43:07
Now how do you come to complain?

1405
01:26:43:08 --> 01:26:46:24
So I pay to be inside
of the rules of the game of society.

1406
01:26:47:04 --> 01:26:51:02
I don't need police, nor magistrate, nor judges
Make me pay this.

1407
01:26:51:03 --> 01:26:52:08
I do it voluntarily.

1408
01:26:52:09 --> 01:26:52:23
So that?

1409
01:26:52:24 --> 01:26:55:16
to be inside
of the rules of the game of a society.

1410
01:26:55:21 --> 01:26:59:19
It's more or less the payment.

1411
01:26:59:20 --> 01:27:00:13
Very good.

1412
01:27:00:28 --> 01:27:03:02
But if you want to know more, read my book.

1413
01:27:03:08 --> 01:27:04:27
Yes, yes, of course.

1414
01:27:04:28 --> 01:27:06:02
The dispute and the word.

1415
01:27:06:02 --> 01:27:08:03
The law in Wayuú society.

1416
01:27:08:04 --> 01:27:10:13
Yes, of course.

1417
01:27:10:15 --> 01:27:13:07
I do not know if. I have it on hand.

1418
01:27:15:00 --> 01:27:16:12
I don't know if I have it here.

1419
01:27:16:12 --> 01:27:24:19
Sometimes one doesn't, I don't know,

1420
01:27:25:10 --> 01:27:31:11
I have one of those...

1421
01:27:39:07 --> 01:27:41:25
is this!

1422
01:27:42:04 --> 01:27:44:05
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes,

1423
01:27:44:21 --> 01:27:45:17
yes, that's it.

1424
01:27:45:17 --> 01:27:48:18
And these are the palabreros. Here are the pictures.

1425
01:27:48:28 --> 01:27:50:16
This old man, this book of my son's

1426
01:27:50:16 --> 01:27:55:20
These are the palabreros, look at them

1427
01:27:56:23 --> 01:27:58:09
the wayuú palabreros.

1428
01:27:58:27 --> 01:28:02:01
That generation that I filmed, most of them have already died.

1429
01:28:02:27 --> 01:28:07:04
I photographed it with a friend in 1998.

1430
01:28:07:05 --> 01:28:10:04
99, my idol, old Isidro.

1431
01:28:10:05 --> 01:28:10:23
Very good

1432
01:28:10:23 --> 01:28:13:17
Palabrero, Gómez died two years ago.

1433
01:28:13:23 --> 01:28:15:13
Or three years.

1434
01:28:15:14 --> 01:28:18:04
This my friend Angel Amaya,
The greatest of all.

1435
01:28:18:13 --> 01:28:20:26
Yeah. They are going to release him now.

1436
01:28:21:17 --> 01:28:24:19
His years of dead next year in a few days,
and then they are going to take it out.

1437
01:28:24:20 --> 01:28:27:09
This was my great friend,
that was my trusted palabrero

1438
01:28:27:10 --> 01:28:31:17
because I was Secretary of Indigenous Affairs
and he was my right hand.

1439
01:28:32:03 --> 01:28:35:27
I solved the problems with him
through him, we

1440
01:28:35:28 --> 01:28:38:13
we met and, we worked.

1441
01:28:38:14 --> 01:28:41:11
This was my uncle Guillermo Estrada,
a great palabrero.

1442
01:28:42:09 --> 01:28:44:18
This Néstor Polanco lived in Uribia and

1443
01:28:45:21 --> 01:28:47:26
another very famous palabrero,

1444
01:28:47:27 --> 01:28:51:06
This is the old xxx, a good talker.

1445
01:28:51:19 --> 01:28:54:09
This one still lives, he lives.

1446
01:28:54:10 --> 01:28:56:14
The only one who lives is called Ismael Parra

1447
01:28:56:15 --> 01:29:00:05
He is very old now and taught me many things.

1448
01:29:00:16 --> 01:29:02:11
He died Saraucana.

1449
01:29:02:12 --> 01:29:04:27
This one did live, this is my cousin.

1450
01:29:04:28 --> 01:29:06:12
And he lives.

1451
01:29:06:12 --> 01:29:09:19
He is Carlos Curbelo, but he is not a palabrero,
he has been in conflicts.

1452
01:29:09:20 --> 01:29:11:28
I put him in because he knows a lot about war.

1453
01:29:11:29 --> 01:29:12:15
He died.

1454
01:29:12:15 --> 01:29:16:04
King Said Juana.

1455
01:29:16:05 --> 01:29:18:18
This is the cane that too.

1456
01:29:18:25 --> 01:29:20:10
There is another because there are many varieties.

1457
01:29:20:10 --> 01:29:22:08
Not everyone has this.

1458
01:29:22:09 --> 01:29:26:28
That bird could be a simple stick with nothing.

1459
01:29:26:29 --> 01:29:28:01
This is my friend Ángel.

1460
01:29:28:01 --> 01:29:29:22
These are paid collars.

1461
01:29:29:23 --> 01:29:32:07
Look it here.

1462
01:29:32:08 --> 01:29:35:28
A conflict has two solutions.

1463
01:29:35:29 --> 01:29:41:28
Either the war that the staff represents or peace
which represents the necklace.

1464
01:29:42:02 --> 01:29:46:26
That is, human beings always face a dispute
between groups, we go for dialogue,

1465
01:29:47:12 --> 01:29:49:27
peace or we go down that hard path.

1466
01:29:50:13 --> 01:29:54:10
Then look, the photo is very beautiful.

1467
01:29:54:11 --> 01:29:56:28
The picture is beautiful and that’s my pal

1468
01:29:57:18 --> 01:29:59:07
He was a wise man, he was a wise man.

1469
01:29:59:07 --> 01:30:02:04
I talked to him for hours and hours and he told me so many

1470
01:30:02:05 --> 01:30:03:15
things and me

1471
01:30:03:15 --> 01:30:06:06
He explained stories about him, settling conflicts.

1472
01:30:06:07 --> 01:30:08:10
Difficulties, everything he

1473
01:30:08:28 --> 01:30:13:15
He lived, how hard it was for him to fix something
and how he finally solved it.

1474
01:30:14:18 --> 01:30:17:24
These are the payment collars, he is there.

1475
01:30:17:25 --> 01:30:22:17
The palabrero must know the value of the necklaces,
because with this you reach the

1476
01:30:22:18 --> 01:30:24:12
agreements, then.

1477
01:30:24:13 --> 01:30:26:14
There are necklaces that are made of sea coral.

1478
01:30:27:03 --> 01:30:29:16
Or gold corals.

1479
01:30:29:17 --> 01:30:32:07
Basically, archaeological accounts.

1480
01:30:32:08 --> 01:30:33:08
So

1481
01:30:33:09 --> 01:30:35:13
This is her daughter getting ready there on a table.

1482
01:30:35:14 --> 01:30:39:20
This is how they arrange themselves when there is going to be a payment, they get
and the necklaces are displayed so that the other party

1483
01:30:39:21 --> 01:30:43:25
see them and examine if they are happy,
if you are getting a good necklace,

1484
01:30:44:13 --> 01:30:47:15
You can reject some or accept others or all of that.

1485
01:30:47:21 --> 01:30:49:05
Or ask for a specific one?

1486
01:30:49:05 --> 01:30:53:24
If you don't want such a necklace,
then they look for it and bring it,

1487
01:30:53:25 --> 01:30:57:26
and this is what women keep
so when there are wars in the family to be able to pay.

1488
01:30:58:18 --> 01:31:01:15
Generally women guard them. Yeah

1489
01:31:04:00 --> 01:31:04:28
is that it?

1490
01:31:05:00 --> 01:31:07:07
that's the bird

1491
01:31:08:11 --> 01:31:10:16
the first palabrero, the one that brings Utta.

1492
01:31:11:19 --> 01:31:13:20
innelus ruficollis

1493
01:31:13:21 --> 01:31:17:18
It is called in Latin innelus ruficollis .

1494
01:31:17:19 --> 01:31:18:17
Yes, and there is another.

1495
01:31:18:17 --> 01:31:22:11
Even he has a necklace here on his chest.

1496
01:31:23:04 --> 01:31:25:09
Because when he

1497
01:31:25:12 --> 01:31:30:12
Mareiwa one of the great Wayuú beings, an instructor,
A mythical figure told him, I want

1498
01:31:30:13 --> 01:31:34:11
You to give the humans
the laws to live in society.

1499
01:31:34:23 --> 01:31:38:07
He retired to the mountain and brought the laws.

1500
01:31:38:19 --> 01:31:39:15
And Mareiwa

1501
01:31:39:15 --> 01:31:42:27
liked it and told him
I'm going to reward you with two things, a necklace,

1502
01:31:43:07 --> 01:31:47:02
because you did your job very well
and the gift of good humor.

1503
01:31:47:03 --> 01:31:49:26
The bird's song sounds like human laughter.

1504
01:31:50:10 --> 01:31:54:07
You feel it like
laughing, when he is around it is like a laugh.

1505
01:31:54:15 --> 01:31:59:16
And then, because these beings consider that
The best gift for a human being is good humor.

1506
01:32:00:20 --> 01:32:01:13
Keep a.

1507
01:32:01:13 --> 01:32:03:20
Attitude.

1508
01:32:03:21 --> 01:32:05:12
This is a tree

1509
01:32:05:13 --> 01:32:08:06
Trupillo?
Let me see. It could be a trick.

1510
01:32:08:07 --> 01:32:09:27
Yes, I think so.

1511
01:32:09:28 --> 01:32:13:08
A little trick, which is very good.

1512
01:32:14:14 --> 01:32:16:15
Each tree is a story among the Wayuú

1513
01:32:16:16 --> 01:32:19:19
That's why it's good to know what it is. What tree is it?

1514
01:32:23:25 --> 01:32:26:06
And here are interviews that I did with him,

1515
01:32:26:07 --> 01:32:28:22
In addition to the analysis that I did as an anthropologist.

1516
01:32:28:23 --> 01:32:30:08
Of the whole topic.

1517
01:32:30:09 --> 01:32:34:20
I felt that I was facing a generation
of beings that were going to leave

1518
01:32:35:16 --> 01:32:40:09
and I interviewed them and made an annex of interviews,
where I asked them and they

1519
01:32:40:10 --> 01:32:41:18
They answered.

1520
01:32:42:17 --> 01:32:45:16
Well, that's my book about the sea,

1521
01:32:45:18 --> 01:32:48:23
I worked with Wayuú fishermen,
the fishing theme,

1522
01:32:49:23 --> 01:32:53:11
the animals, the seascape,
because there is a landscape at the bottom of the

1523
01:32:53:12 --> 01:32:56:03
Sea and then the Wayuú classify them.

1524
01:32:56:04 --> 01:32:57:16
They have their knowledge.

1525
01:32:57:17 --> 01:33:00:22
Of the winds, as the winds are.

1526
01:33:01:04 --> 01:33:04:25
The Archaeological Museum of Aruba published that to me.
