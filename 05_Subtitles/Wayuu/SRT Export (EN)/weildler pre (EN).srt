1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,500
What I wanted to say about the land

2
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:08,166
Mma in the case of the Wayú,

3
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:10,208
is that without a doubt she is

4
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:14,125
the mother of living beings,

5
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:17,916
of some of them, those who are over it,
because there are other beings like the stars.

6
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,375
and other beings

7
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:20,833
that are not from her, the sea itself

8
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:24,500
It's not her, it's a sister.

9
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:28,958
In the Wayú conception,
she has a capacity of transformation

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,208
of beings, because the Earth is mysterious

11
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:38,083
and when she is mysterious, we do not know her will

12
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:43,125
to transform or to change, transform
what’s on it.

13
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:46,875
And humans are part of that,
but also the animals, the plants.

14
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,541
So the Wayuú have that notion
of the mysteriousness of the earth.

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,041
Sometimes it's reckless,

16
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:58,166
sometimes it's reckless,

17
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:01,333
curious, confused, curious

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,791
and unpredictable, and

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,250
There are times when

20
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,000
faints like a woman, lifeless,

21
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,875
In the summer, in the drought, the earth faints.

22
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:20,166
Then Lluvia (rain), which is a
being masculine, hyper masculine,

23
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,083
appears and it rains.

24
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,166
that rain

25
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:30,000
Wakes her up from her fainting

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,291
And she explodes all her vitality.

27
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:37,708
The trees shed leaves, flowers, fruits.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,125
Animals reproduce

29
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,458
humans also

30
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:43,125
reproduce and their

31
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:45,500
living conditions are greater,

32
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,916
They are better because today

33
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,916
everything is abundant.

34
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:54,208
So there

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,625
we have to see the earth, separating it

36
00:01:56,666 --> 00:02:00,208
a bit of the stereotype that has been created

37
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:05,750
sometimes from environmentalist sectors,
sometimes in indigenous peoples themselves

38
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:09,791
who have also idealized that and

39
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,000
something starts forming

40
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,041
something we have called global neo-shamanism,

41
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,791
which is sometimes an idealization
of indigenous peoples and sometimes

42
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:27,166
we erase borders, as if all indigenous
people think the same and they do not think the same.

43
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,416
Only here, in La Guajira, a few

44
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,166
kilometers, there are the iwa, the Kogi.

45
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:34,958
and the wayuú

46
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,083
They are here at a few kilometers from them.

47
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,416
They both have completely different cosmologies.

48
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:45,208
And within the Wayú themselves there are also,
Is it different or more or less?

49
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:50,208
They share it, only there are geo-environmental nuances,

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,666
For example,
the stories among the peoples of the sea

51
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,833
They emphasize marine elements,
for the sea, the

52
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,375
fisherman,

53
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:03,166
pastors tend to have that,
but it is the same, that is, they have elements.

54
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:07,958
What happens there is a beautiful concept,
who was attributed by

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,916
an American psychologist,
They are called dogmatic neighborhoods.

56
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,208
It means that the knowledge

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,791
is not universal, it is distributed in neighborhoods.

58
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,833
The same myth can have its variation if it is
collected

59
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:26,625
inside the territory
that if you pick it up on the seashore, where the fishermen

60
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,166
are going to add

61
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:32,666
a very marine environment,

62
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,458
and that allows us to see
how these narratives have their variations.

63
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,458
That kind of things.

64
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:45,041
So for me it is key
then put as emphasis

65
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:48,416
that, that, first,

66
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,958
indigenous peoples have cosmologies
differentiated.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,375
Some peoples have cosmogonies

68
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:58,000
and others have cosmologies

69
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,000
and the difference is key.

70
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:03,333
Those who are interested in
the origin of the universe,

71
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:06,666
in the creation stories of the universe,
They one type of people.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,291
The Greeks were very interested
in cosmogonies.

73
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:16,041
The Theogony of Sidon is the story of the gods
and how the world was formed

74
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,791
and makes a genealogy of the gods.

75
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:23,791
In the Wayuú world
is more cosmological, they are more curious

76
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:29,125
About the transformation of the universe,
for the modeling of the universe than for its creation.

77
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,083
Yes, there are creation narratives.

78
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:35,041
There may be, but it is not an oral set.

79
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,000
When one examines hundreds of myths,

80
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,666
one begins to find that the emphasis and everything is
in the transformative.

81
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,291
In fact, they have notions of transformative times

82
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:49,333
and they are very interested if their narratives
are about how the universe transforms.

83
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,041
That is the big concern.

84
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,541
So the explanation
that they give to the world, including the Earth,

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,333
is that

86
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:05,458
the world has two elements
the physical element, which is the appearance of beings,

87
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,041
morphology.

88
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:10,000
That banana that is there, for example, he
has an appearance

89
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:14,750
that we are seeing, but they have an interior element,
an interiority

90
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:19,791
that lives within physicality,
which is the capacity

91
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:23,083
the ability to see the universe, to have

92
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,250
a point of view on the universe

93
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,208
and to act in the universe.

94
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,833
Much of Western thought,
which is also derived from the Greeks,

95
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,875
sees some beings as a backdrop.

96
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,916
Like... like Aristotle said,

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,666
He considered plants to be the least

98
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:50,208
who lack intellect
and emotions,

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,041
there are humans,
then the animals, in the Wayuú world it is the other way around.

100
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,250
Plants are naturally wise beings

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,666
They

102
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,041
They are the wise ones and then the animals and

103
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,458
then the humans.

104
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,125
That they are the dumbest in the universe.

105
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:11,125
Why are plants wiser? They are wiser

106
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:15,666
because they were humans in the past
that were transformed.

107
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,125
Everyone was human.

108
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,458
The entire universe was human.

109
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:24,583
The stars, the winds,
the animals, everything was human.

110
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,875
And suddenly, by Mma,

111
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:31,791
the Earth, which is mysterious,
because he fought with Palaa,

112
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,458
because there were floods from

113
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,500
that Palaa, the sea, invaded the Earth

114
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,000
his sister, they fight.

115
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,750
Because there are beings that transform.

116
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:48,750
When someone breaks a rule,
the very violent like a jaguar,

117
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:52,916
a human was turned into a jaguar for his desire
for violence,

118
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:57,125
the war, the blood. The crows,

119
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,875
the carrion birds that were

120
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,875
Wayuú shepherds who liked meat,
They ate the entire flock,

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,041
then they ate any dead animal
that they found,

122
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:12,958
They were uncontrollable
their obsession with meat were transformed

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,041
in the buzzards, in the crows that we see today
who eat rotten meat.

124
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,250
The snake, the rabbit, because it was very sad,

125
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,333
He was mischievous and they transformed him. Anyway,

126
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:28,166
then all those stories of the Wayuú
They show us the transformation,

127
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,250
but from the transformation we move to the current world.

128
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,875
The world as we see it today,

129
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,166
then the plants

130
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:42,041
When they transformed from being humans,
that their arms turned into leaves,

131
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:47,750
their legs in stems and in roots,
They stayed in the place where they were assigned.

132
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,000
They are peaceful,

133
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:54,041
They don't attack anyone, they don't mess with anyone.

134
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,958
This doesn't happen to animals or humans.

135
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,000
So, that desire for pacifism,

136
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:05,083
that ability to stay in the place that suits you
was assigned,

137
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:08,125
Well, in these cosmological notions
the world has an order,

138
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,333
the world has an order,

139
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,708
Even the rain has an order.

140
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,166
The rain must water in an way
and the intensity of its fall

141
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,458
must be gradual,
and then all that is an order.

142
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,916
For this reason they are considered the wisest beings

143
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,000
that is in nature.

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,458
And when the Wayú fight for land,

145
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:33,166
displaced persons, for example, violence,
the Wayuú tell him

146
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:37,250
you have to be like the plants
that they do not dispute the lands with anyone.

147
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,375
They stayed in the place they told them,
this is your place and from there

148
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,375
They live and

149
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,583
there are.

150
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:49,500
But the plant also preserves
a residual humanity that dwells within her.

151
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,333
That past, not that past
but that transhistorical time,

152
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:57,000
because it is not a notion of the past,
present and future

153
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,125
as in the West,

154
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:02,833
that linear vision,
It is a vision of discontinuous time

155
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:07,958
and other complex shocks of time,
which is not cyclical time.

156
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:12,666
No, that's linear time that goes around,
It's the same linear time, but it goes around.

157
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:16,083
These are discontinuous times,

158
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,125
times that may be ahead,

159
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:24,041
times that can be parallel
with everyday time

160
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:29,208
and times that are referential, that tell us
we must refer to the order

161
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,375
of this time

162
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,333
that is there.

163
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,916
So with the dream,

164
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,000
the ritual, the landscape,

165
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,333
that time is accessible to the current time,

166
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:49,000
for the stories, for the history, for the visual.

167
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:53,250
So every tree, every plant has that
and the animals too.

168
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:58,041
In fact, it is believed that they had knowledge,
They practiced their trade.

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,250
The spider wove and taught humans
to knit, to women.

170
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,750
The jaguar knew how to wage war,

171
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,583
we know the war for them.

172
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:13,083
Corn was a farmer, just like the bean,

173
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,458
We learn agriculture from them.

174
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:19,541
Music came to us from animals or trees,

175
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:24,208
like the flute from which we get the wood.

176
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,041
In short, jobs and human institutions
They are a legacy,

177
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,708
a legacy, from other living beings,

178
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:36,041
most of which are not human,
They are not human.

179
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,125
So,

180
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,500
let's say for

181
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:57,000
To explain it this way, they are notions of the Wayuú world
that have to do with the role of the Earth

182
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,000
like a being,

183
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:02,625
a maternal, feminine, large being, who somehow

184
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:07,625
She is the mother of us all,
but that sometimes arises in a stereotype.

185
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,750
like that being

186
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,333
wise, infallible, pure.

187
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:16,458
No, she is a being with generous traits,

188
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,208
fertile, gives life, but mysterious and reckless.

189
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,916
May fall into disputes.
When the Wayuú see climate change

190
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,291
and when the Wayuú talk about coastal erosion

191
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:33,166
and all this warming, they see it as wars,

192
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,333
tensions between Palaa and Mma, the Earth.

193
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,416
They keep those tensions and

194
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,750
those tensions that are in time.

195
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,166
It’s not like it just happened and the collapse comes,

196
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,208
The world is going to end for the first time.

197
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,500
No, they say, that's old,

198
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:59,125
we know that they have tensions
and that there may be times when

199
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,666
Palaa invades

200
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:06,958
and they show us the snails, the shells
that are inside the Earth and the Sea is far away

201
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,541
and says look, this is proof that Mma,

202
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,083
that the sea had invaded the land
so long ago.

203
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,333
Yeah.

204
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:29,500
So, well, that's how to introduce

205
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,041
what we can talk about,
to give you a vision.

206
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,333
Yes.

207
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,625
Original of all this town

208
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:38,666
Well,

209
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,916
many of the things you have said,

210
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,083
that's true.

211
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,708
and I have been living in Peru,

212
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,041
and I was noticing a lot about people
there, friends that I was making.

213
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,708
they had a different relationship with the Earth.

214
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,416
Clear.

215
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:58,083
And all the moon, the sun.

216
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,125
A relationship between a human,

217
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:06,291
a spiritual being and what I wanted to capture

218
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,750
was in

219
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:13,083
the minds of city people
or Western culture.

220
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,791
It was that basically

we are killing our mother a little

221
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:24,000
This is how we can fight that
or how can we stop that in a way

222
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,458
is to show intimate relationships with the earth

223
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,291
or with nature, for example,

224
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,000
because as you are saying, many

225
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,583
indigenous, many are not, there is no separation, right?

226
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,916
And then what we did there

227
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,833
and what we want to do
Here they are two different things.

228
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,041
And I was telling them something about that and

229
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:52,041
is that first of all we want to expose

230
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,875
the territory,

231
00:13:55,916 --> 00:14:00,208
physical things, like the wind, the hills.

232
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,750
Yes, the hills are brutal. They are brutal

233
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:05,041
Yes, but as a main character

234
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,583
of the story.

235
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:13,125
So what we are doing is a documentary
from a series of like six places in Colombia.

236
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:18,083
Now and in each of them
We want to focus first on the territory,

237
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,833
because as you are saying, that territory

238
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:25,125
has a different relevance for each group

239
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,125
and then we want to show

240
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,583
the territory as it is alive and we are

241
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,625
from what we have read from you and others
is that here it is the wind.

242
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,875
It's like one of the (…)
which is vital and also

243
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,833
speaking as a filmmaker the best

244
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:46,750
to show because they have an agency, right?

245
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:47,875
One can see it.

246
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:51,875
And there are several, in plural,
It is not just one, it is many winds.

247
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,041
Well, let me see if I can bring you here,

248
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,458
I have something I published
in a Mexican magazine about winds.

249
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:08,375
Cool.

250
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:28,041
Wilder Guerra.
Yeah,

251
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,208
that's all.

252
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,416
Of course it is in Spanish.

253
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,375
So,

254
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,875
It is called “At the mercy of the winds”.

255
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,375
Talks a little about the relationship between men and

256
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,166
It is also published in

257
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,083
Internet.

258
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:48,791
I don't know if I read

259
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:52,583
everything, but yes.

260
00:15:52,625 --> 00:16:00,041
Yes, at the mercy of the winds.

261
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:04,625
It's about I guess each of the winds

262
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,916
also has their different character.

263
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:12,125
their mood, each one their temperament.

264
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,041
Some are beneficial, others

265
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,458
They bring hunger, drought, others...

266
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,083
Yes, that will vary.

267
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,250
Yes, yes.

268
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,083
Well, there's so much to talk about, right?

269
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,125
Yeah.

270
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,166
There's a lot

271
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:50,458
and I love that of the territory, because
the territory is like a book, the territory

272
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,708
speaks, the territory just with its landscape

273
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,208
He's talking, he's saying,

274
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,125
things and...

275
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,375
and the hills,

276
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:04,750
each hill has a meaning, it is not there

277
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,958
capriciously, it is not part of a promontory.

278
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,208
In fact, the Wayuú share with the Australians,

279
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,041
with the Australian aborigines, the idea that

280
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,208
life is somewhat part of the intention of the place.

281
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,875
A product not just of the land, but

282
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,208
the place, the specific place.

283
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:31,333
And there are some places that are called, and that are

284
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,458
the holes like the vaginas of the earth

285
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,083
by which a lineage, not all humans,

286
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,083
a specific human lineage came into the world.

287
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,583
It emerged into the world.

288
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:47,875
These are called territorial roots,
as heads of the territory.

289
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,958
And each Wayuú lineage has one in the

290
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,583
upper Guajira,

291
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,416
They are water holes or water depressions,

292
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,666
through which it came out, emerged from the Earth,

293
00:17:59,083 --> 00:17:59,833
the world.

294
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,166
And that is very important in the

295
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,875
Wayuú territoriality.

296
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,125
The cemeteries

297
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,000
are important

298
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:13,000
because they are the way to renew
a pact with the territory

299
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,041
through the corpses.

300
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:20,791
I return the bodies to you
and I express my will to live here

301
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,791
because I'm burying my relatives here,

302
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,041
I come to this place, marks the world.

303
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:32,541
Yeah, that's a very, very key thing between that

304
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:37,041
world of the Samarians. There's a

305
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,000
poem, there is a beautiful poem.

306
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,750
Let me see if I can find it for you, because sometimes the literature
illuminates more,

307
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,500
as much as anthropology.

308
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,333
Yes.

309
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,083
The poem. I don't know if you have read Vito Apshana

310
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,083
No

311
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,666
I advise you to read it.

312
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:01,000
He is a great Wayuú poet.

313
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,791
I'm going to put it here.

314
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,166
I mean, the newcomer.

315
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,416
And he has a poem.

316
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,583
and the newcomers

317
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:29,041
poetic and

318
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,083
“Ancient newcomers”

319
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,625
I recommend you this poem

320
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,875
Vito Apshana.

321
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:41,041
Yes, he has one,

322
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,750
some very Wayuú poems

323
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,958
Within the Wayuú ontology and thought,

324
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,208
So one of the themes is that of the Earth.

325
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,041
Well, he has a lot about Earth.

326
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,833
But,

327
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:02,208
but I like this one a lot.

328
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,416
Yes, Ancient newcomers.

329
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:08,083
Here it is

330
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,041
I can

331
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:19,083
I send it to you

332
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,541
Here it is.

333
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,166
And I send it to you.

334
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,083
So that

335
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:37,750
the people of La Guajira right?

336
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,666
Yes, is here. I already sent you the link.

337
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:41,625
You can get in there

338
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:46,083
It's very beautiful.

339
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:49,041
Yes, yes, very beautiful. His texts.

340
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,708
He is coming here today.

341
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,416
Yes, he comes today, he is in Bogotá, he will come today

342
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,875
and I can give you the

343
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,208
contact to interview you.

344
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,833
One of these days.

345
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:07,041
And yes, do an interview talking about his poems.

346
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,583
His poems about the Earth are excellent, powerful

347
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:15,125
From the earth, from a very good, powerful sun,
a message.

348
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,083
That well, one verse sums up everything we have been talking

349
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,041
about

350
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:22,208
That's what poetry has.

351
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,125
That gift, that strength

352
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,750
Something beyond scientific words
or the words.

353
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,750
Yes, yes, yes, that's right.

354
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:44,708
And “Ancient newcomers”

355
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,000
Then you get the whole book.

356
00:21:47,083 --> 00:22:32,833
I'm looking for poems by him.

357
00:22:32,875 --> 00:25:29,000
Yes, poetry.

358
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,666
And well, I

359
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:33,791
I sent you the link and I can give you the contact.

360
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:36,833
I talk to him today I tell him you are here,
How long will they be there?

361
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:40,375
We are in La Guajira, surely a

362
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:43,208
two more weeks

363
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,416
He's going to last nine days here, he's going to be busy,
but I know that

364
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:49,458
He can take the time to talk to you.

365
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:51,083
Because it is that he

366
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,291
President is coming tomorrow.

367
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:55,375
Petro. and is going to

368
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:57,916
spend a week in La Guajira,

369
00:25:57,958 --> 00:25:59,500
A shaman?

370
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:00,625
One week.

371
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:01,958
Oh, a week.

372
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:04,208
He will rule for a week from here

373
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,416
then all the ministers come.

374
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:09,666
They are going to be in Alta Guajira,
There are going to be many meetings with the population.

375
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:10,666
Wayuú.

376
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:12,750
With the population of the mountains, too.

377
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:14,791
About the zoo?

378
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:18,166
That is a good point, there are other points in water,

379
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:21,500
malnutrition of children, health,

380
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:22,500
education,

381
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,958
they have other topics.

382
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:29,333
Water is key, the issue of water is fundamental.

383
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:31,375
But the theme about the parks too.

384
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:36,333
They go to work
to see if they reach an agreement.

385
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:39,375
And how long will you be here too?

386
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:41,416
I'll be there until Friday.

387
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:43,083
Until Friday?

388
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,708
Yes because there is a festival in Bogotá, Festival Gabo.

389
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,500
and then I'm going to go to

390
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,208
festival, I have

391
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:52,500
a conversation there for Bogotá. Yeah.

392
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:58,041
It would be nice, maybe and we can come again
and make an interview recorded.

393
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:02,041
Whenever you want, you tell me, let's set the date and here in the
house if you like.

394
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:04,208
I know, here, here it is very nice.

395
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I think we can do two
one here and one outside, there the Earth itself.

396
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:13,083
That's where such. Maybe it's not Monday or Tuesday.

397
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:14,125
If you have time.

398
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:17,083
And Tuesday can be Tuesday,
because on Monday it may be very.

399
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:19,625
Still busy, but can. It will be Tuesday.

400
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,791
Let's do Tuesday, then. Of course.

401
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:26,791
Something before that I wanted to ask him.

402
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:30,250
One approach of ours is

403
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:33,875
Who should tell a story how should it be told?

404
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:34,541
Of course.

405
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:38,291
And last night or the night before, the day before yesterday

406
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:42,541
there was talk about how good
Gabo's story,

407
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:46,791
I don't remember the name of the book
but because it was from a perspective within the Wayuú.

408
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,333
La Cándida Eréndira.

409
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:53,583
Yes, that one. And so what we're doing is on Wednesday,

410
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:57,583
We are going to meet with a young Wayuú, his name is

411
00:27:58,041 --> 00:27:58,875
Neko.

412
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:02,125
Neko is

413
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:05,250
It is from near Manaure, where there is a ranch.

414
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:08,291
There we had the contact of a friend and well,

415
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:12,750
He is a director starting out in cinema and he

416
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:16,000
He is going to be like our director for this chapter.

417
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:17,583
Well.

418
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:20,041
I have a friend, David Hernández.

419
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:25,250
David Fernández also directs
He has made documentaries about the Wayuús

420
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:26,500
He’s made videos, he’s made movies

421
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:30,125
Yes, Wayuú from Venezuela, David Hernández Palmar

422
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:33,208
No, a group of Wayuú youth has been formed here

423
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,958
in that audiovisual world.

424
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:37,541
Seeing that there is a lot.

425
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,583
So many, Leiqui Uriana.

426
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:43,875
The other girl, Polanco, Mile Polanco

427
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:47,041
in Cabo de la Vela there is a collective.

428
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,625
Of young Wayú, but very good. Yeah.

429
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:55,208
They have played a very important role and.

430
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:57,500
And that's fine.

431
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:01,166
Following that theme,
we wanted to ask you

432
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:03,750
if you

433
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,958
would make a wayuú documentary,

434
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:10,625
How would you do it,
Like I don't know what things

435
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,375
would like, how to put, capture,

436
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:17,250
explain, what would it be like I don't know,

437
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,708
the story as such that I would believe

438
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,041
There is an advantage with the world

439
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,791
Wayuú and it is that in

440
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:28,208
their cosmology are in the territory.

441
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:33,208
So when we go to a hill
like the Teta hill,

442
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:37,583
that hill speaks to us,
He talks to us, he is telling us things.

443
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:41,083
Every time you focus on an image,

444
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,750
only the image is telling us things

445
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:48,375
and there are some popular hills,
I would say that there are about three tutelary hills,

446
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:51,083
the word would be tutelary, which are

447
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:56,041
at Cabo La Vela,
a hill called Kamachi, the old. Epitsü that’s near Uribia

448
00:29:56,291 --> 00:30:01,166
which is the Teta Hill and in the upper part,
in La Macuira, there is hill Iitujolu, but those hills

449
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:06,333
they are brothers,
They are hills that guard the territory,

450
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:09,791
that give order and meaning to the territory.

451
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:12,958
Now, there are other small hills that are very rich

452
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,166
historically they are in the cape, you can see Bantu, Piirra and,

453
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:22,250
others are there near that one and there are many mythical places.

454
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:25,958
So I would focus a lot

455
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,208
in the geographical

456
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,458
Landmarks of the territory,
because each geographical landmark,

457
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,958
Their single image is already a set of stories.

458
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:41,708
He is speaking to us, as soon as you
focus on it, he is speaking.

459
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,625
And there is even a book that I don't know
if you know,

460
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:49,041
Small and simple, stories with GPS.

461
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,666
What is called Stories with GPS?

462
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:53,625
Stories with GPS.

463
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,500
No,

464
00:30:56,541 --> 00:31:01,333
Yes, in fact, we just read it,
I believe because he quotes you a lot in fact.

465
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:03,125
In that there is

466
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:04,291
Stories with GPS

467
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:05,291
Let me see if I send it to you

468
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:08,000
because it is a trip that I took,

469
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:10,041
I was the guide,

470
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,333
the Historical Memory Commission,

471
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:17,000
they wanted to visit La Guajira
and they wanted me to show them that.

472
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:19,750
Well, here it is. This is the book.

473
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:22,208
Okay.

474
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,875
This is from the internet, it can be downloaded on the web.

475
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,458
I think maybe if we read this. Yes Yes.

476
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,250
So this,

477
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:32,583
This, for example, is the hill of Guososopo

478
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,083
Guososopo

479
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:39,000
It means our lungs,
because this is as if you

480
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:43,041
you would open a person's lungs, alive,

481
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:45,958
and they would look like this pink.

482
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:52,083
A Wayuú who in mythical times
He traveled from the Sierra Nevada,

483
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,291
He traveled all this

484
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,500
and died of thirst

485
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,208
in the desert,
Only his lungs were left, turned into hills.

486
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:05,000
So this hill is a story and it is a hill,
then like this

487
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:07,916
each one of those hills has a meaning,

488
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:12,166
has a story to tell,
so that's why we did it

489
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:16,041
So, we traveled for three days stopping in each place,

490
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:19,541
I told the mythical stories,
That is the story of this book.

491
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:22,125
Yes, yes.

492
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:24,083
And in there, like this

493
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:27,250
they are inside there are

494
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:31,625
So I would focus on that, if you want,

495
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:35,250
work the territory very visually.

496
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:36,958
Sometimes they focus on homes and yes,

497
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,125
homes are important,
but there are multiple, thousands of homes.

498
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:46,041
Instead, these places,
talk to those background places,

499
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:47,208
the sea too

500
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,625
or a territorial root.

501
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:55,000
There is a stone, the stone of Aalasü
that is up there,

502
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:57,916
that stone is mythological,

503
00:32:57,916 --> 00:32:59,958
there are all the family clan emblems,

504
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,041
That stone tells us a lot.

505
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:06,125
Let's see if I have it here.

506
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:09,875
If I have it.

507
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:14,208
It seems that no, I don't have it here,

508
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:17,291
but I'm going to put it

509
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:21,791
Ancient newcomers. Is…

510
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:29,541
so that's my idea.

511
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:30,208
Now,

512
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:33,208
There are trees that tell us a lot.

513
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:33,708
Also.

514
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:38,041
Because they are stories about trees
and a beautiful, fundamental, very common tree

515
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:41,125
here is Trujillo, it's called Aipia.

516
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:44,250
His task was to heal

517
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:46,833
the fractures of people when they were human,

518
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:51,416
before it became a
tree, he dedicated himself to healing

519
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:56,333
and today if you break your leg,
an arm,

520
00:33:57,083 --> 00:34:01,666
They splint it for you with wood from Trupillo,
because that was his job

521
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:07,333
and it is a tree that the Wayuú leave near their homes.

522
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:11,333
They generally cut down everything
to have a view of who is arriving.

523
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:12,625
So.

524
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:15,083
But the tree they leave is Trupillo

525
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:19,500
His name is Aipia and he is very wise, he is peaceful.

526
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:23,250
It has many advantages.

527
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:24,833
Gives food,

528
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,083
Before it gave nutritious food,
proteins, vegetables.

529
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,458
Nowadays the Wayuú have somewhat lost their consumption of

530
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,375
that was

531
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:35,541
so important for Wayuú nutrition.

532
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:39,166
So the trees tell us things,

533
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:44,541
So if you focus, you are going to film, look.
what do you have back there,

534
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,333
because surely there is a story in the plant,
It is more than a backdrop,

535
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,708
It is a story.

536
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,041
Yes, so that is what I was going to recommend,

537
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:58,166
That would be my advice. The rest,

538
00:34:58,208 --> 00:35:01,458
Well, the Earth is an excellent starting point,

539
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:04,083
perhaps the deepest starting point

540
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:07,125
It is the issue of territory.

541
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:09,500
I would have coastal areas,

542
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:13,583
inland areas, of shepherds, the Wayuú economy

543
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:16,041
It tells us about a relationship with the land.

544
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:21,083
Wayuú agriculture is beautiful, and I talked about it
that night.

545
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:23,125
What's the point of all this?

546
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:29,416
Grazing, fishing, weaving also speak to us,
because the fabric

547
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:33,125
look at this,

548
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:37,291
This is a Wayuú fabric,
but this is a fabric of the sea,

549
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:43,750
This is called like the eye of the fish,
like the eye of the fish.

550
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:47,375
So I'm going to show it to you here,

551
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:48,625
rather,

552
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:54,041
These are Wayuú graphics, canoe graphics.

553
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,750
So,

554
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:58,083
when filming a documentary

555
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:00,208
I would say that,

556
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:02,708
look at this,

557
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,083
They are the Wayuú
hanging fish like leaves

558
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,208
So,

559
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:14,208
What I mean is that when we see a backpack,

560
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:17,791
When we see a Wayuú object, it is talking to us,

561
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,250
but sometimes we go over it

562
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:24,000
like shapes that have no message that’s just a fabric.

563
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:27,166
This means like the eye of the fish,

564
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:31,083
like the eye of the fish.

565
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:32,625
So,

566
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,125
I would also suggest

567
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:38,541
To do a lot in

568
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:42,000
in the graphics, in the designs, in the objects.

569
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:44,791
The artifacts have a meaning and they are
Talking to us

570
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:47,708
It’s just that we don't know how to read, we don't know how to read,

571
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:51,333
we would be illiterate in these graphics,
as if we saw

572
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:54,000
a sign written in

573
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,291
Russian or Hindi or Chinese, one could not read it,

574
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:59,000
Well, that's what happens with Wayuú graphics.

575
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,750
Yes.

576
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,000
Look at this for example.

577
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:07,750
That's nice.
From Palabrero.

578
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:12,000
Yes, Oops, yes.

579
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:15,000
This is the first bird

580
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:18,666
who worked as a palabrero

581
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:20,041
in mythological times.

582
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:23,958
He created the Wayuú laws, the norms
and then he retired.

583
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:28,750
But the knowledge they have of the
Wayuú laws belong to a bird.

584
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,291
Utta is called Utta

585
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,500
and can you still see it?

586
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:36,666
Yes, the bird exists, of course, I have photographed it.

587
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:38,708
Of course.

588
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,833
It's a big bird, it's tame.

589
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:43,791
It's not a bird that gets scared, but no, no, no,

590
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,250
I approached him very close.

591
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:49,125
He has a bird necklace, here,

592
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,041
a black, yellow and black necklace.

593
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,750
They awarded that necklace,

594
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:57,041
It was given by Mareiwa,
one of the Wayú figures, for having given the laws

595
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,458
he rewarded him.

596
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:12,916
and have you seen many signs and symbols like that?

597
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,833
Well, this is my clan.
Your clan?
Mine Yes, yes, yes.

598
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:17,791
That's why it's there.

599
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:19,458
That's why I

600
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:21,583
said,

601
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:24,625
I was saying that,

602
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:28,125
that,

603
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:35,541
that the graphics speak to us,
but we passed over it.

604
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:01,125
So,

605
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:07,541
a girl said that night,

606
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:09,458
a girl said,

607
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,958
Out of all the musical instruments that,

608
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:13,916
This one is,

609
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:17,166
But they haven't removed this one's beak.

610
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:18,708
For this to be a musical instrument,

611
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:20,708
well, it has to be perfect here, closed

612
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,625
and here one takes off his beak

613
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:25,791
and it is played like this,

614
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:28,333
but only from the Wayuú fishermen.

615
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:30,416
Yes, to communicate.

616
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,750
To communicate yes.

617
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,625
That's interesting because I don't know if you saw it but in

618
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:41,000
Peru there is an indigenous town, it is called Pituquisca

619
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:44,166
of the Quechua up the mountain, in the Andes.

620
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:45,208
Have.

621
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,166
And they have, of course, and they bartered with those on the coast.

622
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,375
The Mayans too,

623
00:39:50,416 --> 00:39:51,166
From the Mayans too

624
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:51,916
a lot, the

625
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:54,625
Mayans in Mexico and yes,

626
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:58,208
In Yucatán that entire area touches those snails.

627
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:02,000
It must have been a very broad horizon.
among the peoples of America.

628
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:04,166
The snail
Yes, that's right.

629
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:08,666
Because I saw a drum and I was in Canadá
about 15 days ago

630
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:12,708
and I had touring up to Winnipeg
throughout that area.

631
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:13,750
Yeah

632
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:17,041
I was in Canadá

633
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,083
I was way up north,
The big rapids and all that,

634
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:23,958
touring indigenous towns and talking

635
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,708
And we had rituals and everything.

636
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,166
And I saw drums, indigenous drums

637
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,166
in Canada.

638
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:35,500
Similar to the ones here?
Similar, similar, but with only one instrument.

639
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:39,166
It is played with only one, not two like the Wayuú but one.

640
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:43,166
And I saw drums of one layer and others like that, and other made

641
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:47,583
with deer stomach
or bison which are water drums.

642
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:50,208
Yes, very interesting.

643
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:52,541
And I was in several ceremonies and everything there in Canada.

644
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,333
So there are a series of instruments

645
00:40:57,125 --> 00:41:01,583
very, very common,
those found, for example,

646
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:07,375
The Wayuú have these, but they have them as maracas.

647
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:08,125
They got them

648
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:08,708
as

649
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:12,583
a musical instrument,
They have this with bison horn.

650
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,833
And this is,

651
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:19,750
It is used for the shamanic ceremony,

652
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:25,000
to go up, find the spirits up there, to heal.

653
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:30,708
So this sound allows it to rise
and the tobacco that the woman chews

654
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,083
shaman woman,

655
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:37,000
It goes up and there it finds in the elevation
the spirit that will help her heal.

656
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:41,458
And then the Canadians have it too,
but they do it with their animals that they have next to them.

657
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:44,041
Yes of the bison.

658
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:46,208
Do you have seeds in there?
Seeds.

659
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:54,333
That's what you were telling me about the clan symbol,

660
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:59,083
I wanted to know a little more about you,
that is, you are from

661
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:03,500
My area is Carrizal, up there, Carrizal.

662
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:06,125
Carrizal, yes, I'm going to show you,

663
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,250
Carrizal is,

664
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:13,833
the land of my ancestors.

665
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:16,833
But that's close to the beach
by Cabo de la Vela.

666
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:18,625
If there is

667
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:20,791
the cemetery,

668
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:28,041
That's why I tell you it's so important.

669
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:14,791
This is located here, perhaps
you saw it here.

670
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:21,083
Look at the hills, the hill, the Cabo de la Vela,
I tell you that it is a story,

671
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:24,250
Kamachi married a windy woman,

672
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:27,125
He manages the things of the sea.
This is the older brother, he is in the Macuira,

673
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:29,083
Itojolu

674
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:31,875
This is the brother, another of the younger brothers.

675
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:34,375
It is towards the Gulf with Venezuela through Uribia,

676
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:38,291
Epitsü, Cerro de la Teta.

677
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:42,041
Each being is a story,
This is a relative of mine, relatives

678
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:44,083
mine, is on a map of the hills.

679
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:48,291
Look in La Guajira
how the hills form a triangle, they are tutelary,

680
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,708
In the territory you have to understand their position.

681
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,041
This is a place where there is cattle,

682
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:57,791
Here I want to show you,

683
00:43:57,791 --> 00:44:00,125
They are Wayuú fishermen.

684
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:02,458
Wayuú fishermen.

685
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:08,166
This place is mythological in Cabo de la Vela
It's called xxxx,

686
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:11,000
It is the hospital where they cure the fish.

687
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:13,208
The fish have an owner, an owner.

688
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:16,125
She, she, she is the owner and her name is Pulowi.

689
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,708
She is the owner of the animals.

690
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:21,000
To fish you have to ask for permission.

691
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,125
You have to do a

692
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:27,625
ritual and all that, because fish are marine cattle
and those are her flocks.

693
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:31,833
So
when the fishermen hit them with a harpoon

694
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:34,708
or a hook and a fishmonger, they are cured there.

695
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:38,375
That place that is on the cabo.

696
00:44:38,416 --> 00:44:40,625
From here,

697
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:44,083
They are tombs...

698
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:49,583
and then in the

699
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:52,125
sea, in the cape, these are the jepira
a mythological place

700
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:57,208
in the cape, the children there in the cape,

701
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:58,125
this is there in the cape,

702
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:01,625
This is Bahia Onda, this is Bahia Onda, a place too, this

703
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:05,166
It was a tour of all of Guajira.

704
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:09,583
in the Macuira, the Macuira

705
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,208
Ah, this is a

706
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:13,750
mythical place, this was,

707
00:45:14,208 --> 00:45:16,250
She was the first Wayuú woman.

708
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:18,166
One of the first women,

709
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:20,708
I had a dentated vagina, she

710
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:24,166
Couldn’t have relations with anyone,
could not be reproduced

711
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:26,875
and some wayuú twins

712
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:31,625
they shot them with an arrow
and all her teeth were blown out.

713
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:35,000
So, that is a very beautiful myth.

714
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:35,500
It's called Wolunka,

715
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:38,416
Wolunka the woman with

716
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:40,000
the toothed vagina.

717
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:43,708
This is the stone that I tell you,

718
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,666
Aalasü,

719
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:47,375
There are all the irons, chlamys,
emblems, look at them,

720
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:50,458
They are there,

Are they there?
Written there, there they are. Yeah.

721
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:53,625
Oh, yeah. and does

722
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,708
many years?
Many, of course.

723
00:45:55,708 --> 00:46:00,583
It's a thing that in time,
In mythological time no, they do not have a date,

724
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:02,083
but in mythical time.

725
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,125
Yes Aalasü,

726
00:46:04,166 --> 00:46:07,125
Aalasü, the stone of the marks, that remains

727
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:10,166
close to Siapana,

728
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:13,000
near a place called Wuipa,

729
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:16,208
Wuipa

730
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:20,333
It's about six hours from here by car.

731
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:27,041
It is a beautiful place,
but it is a fundamental place for

732
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:28,875
Wayuú in the world of myth.

733
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,083
All that

734
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:39,541
route

735
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:44,833
and I don't know why not here

736
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:49,791
Did not come out, it should come out quickly my

737
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:51,750
cemetery because it is there.

738
00:46:51,791 --> 00:46:52,916
Click here, download PDF.

739
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:58,125
Charging.

740
00:46:58,166 --> 00:46:59,208
We'll see.

741
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:24,166
This same book in a more organized PDF.

742
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:25,083
Better.

743
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:28,375
Look, here you have this photo,
I can send it to you by pdf,

744
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:30,875
but I don't know if you saw it, you already have it.

745
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:35,666
We already saw what we just showed ourselves,
but that's the same, but in

746
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:37,916
Book shape, right?

747
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:40,125
Book form, sure, but here it is,

748
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:41,666
Here you must

749
00:47:41,666 --> 00:47:43,500
be the Cemetery,

750
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:46,083
I don't know why it didn't come out.

751
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:49,083
This is a mythological place,

752
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,500
This is The Turtles of Pájara.

753
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,083
This is my territory,

754
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:54,500
where the Wayuú took up cattle,

755
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:57,833
the cattle for the Wayuú came from the sea,

756
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,000
They were turtles that turned into cows

757
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,083
and fish that turned into goats,

758
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:05,625
then one night they caught them

759
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:06,750
and the

760
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:08,541
they took and

761
00:48:08,541 --> 00:48:11,166
He converted them, and that is why they were able to have the animals.

762
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:57,708
Here is my cemetery.

763
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:09,208
look here at the stone from another perspective,
the stone where all the marks are.

764
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:13,166
Serrania of what?

765
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,875
This is in Aalasü,

766
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:16,833
this is,

767
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:18,625
close to la Macuira,

768
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:19,708
not in the Macuira,

769
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:22,041
But close. Yes, yes, close.

770
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:25,666
This is here in Carrizales about an hour

771
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:29,208
and a half by car, easy to go.

772
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:36,666
You have been telling me that the hills themselves,

773
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:40,000
the symbols, the plants, they all have a story, right?

774
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,083
Everything has a meaning.

775
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:43,208
What would one be like?

776
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,166
How could one capture that in film?

777
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:50,875
I mean, would it be someone telling the story more than anything?

778
00:49:50,916 --> 00:49:55,708
Yes, it would be good if someone told it with that in the background,
Someone would tell it with that in the background.

779
00:49:56,166 --> 00:50:00,833
Yes, I'm trying to think of how
We can give our own voice.

780
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:01,500
That's correct

781
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,041
to the thing, right?

782
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:05,083
That's right, that's right.

783
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:08,875
Because they talk, because I know what they're talking about,
but it's hard

784
00:50:08,916 --> 00:50:11,750
sometimes show that.

785
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,958
Of course, of course.

786
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:13,875
The grace is that there is a

787
00:50:13,875 --> 00:50:16,708
history in each of those places.

788
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:19,666
Cemeteries also speak to us.

789
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:23,958
I'm sorry not, I don't know why I didn't find it,

790
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,208
the book the poem

791
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:32,041
From this poem, from Vito Apshana, which was so beautiful, that

792
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:36,000
It seems to me that that also has a huge power

793
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:40,791
In fact, I think that would be a very good way to

794
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:46,333
make the trees, the hills,
They speak in poems.

795
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:47,458
Yes, it is

796
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,875
a little more abstract but oh well.

797
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:51,333
Let's see, let's see if I can find it.

798
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:59,541
Ancient newcorners.

799
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,083
But here look,

800
00:51:11,083 --> 00:51:12,708
for example, this.

801
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:15,291
I wrote this column

802
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:17,916
and published it in El Espectador.

803
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:19,958
Look at it here, here is this part

804
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:24,083
to explain the relationship of the Wayuú

805
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:27,125
with its land, with its cemetery,

806
00:51:27,166 --> 00:51:30,375
the place of belonging,

807
00:51:30,416 --> 00:51:33,083
because the Wayuú have a very beautiful notion,

808
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:35,541
is the place of birth

809
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:39,791
and there is a place of residence
I live here in Riohacha, but this does not belong to me.

810
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:44,250
My place of belonging is my cemetery,
that is the place in the world to which

811
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:46,166
I am assigned, assigned to

812
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:47,875
that's the place.

813
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:50,041
Then look at the poem it says,

814
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:53,791
you were already born, they say

815
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:56,791
to a wayuú, you were already born

816
00:51:58,166 --> 00:52:00,250
and you were born the son of people,

817
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,875
of the founders of Trocha del Cerro Epitsü,

818
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:07,291
and you can go

819
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:11,000
and you may not come back, but you will always be there,

820
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:14,166
next to the tree Mokoshira

821
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:16,583
that surrounds your cemetery

822
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:20,000
and there belongs your shadow and your rest.

823
00:52:20,375 --> 00:52:22,583
Look at the beauty, ok,

824
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:27,208
can move. When these
wind farms are arriving in La Guajira,

825
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:29,708
they are wrong,

826
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:32,250
they talk to the people who are there

827
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:36,458
and they believe that those who are there are the owners,

828
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:40,333
and the owners may be far away because

829
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:44,208
They can live anywhere in the world,

830
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:48,583
but its territory is there,
that belongs to them, they are assigned there.

831
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:54,500
The other could be a son,
but children have no right over the land.

832
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:58,250
Children only have the right
on the land of their mothers.

833
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:02,208
So a parent can leave them there.
as guardians.

834
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:05,166
You take care, but you don't decide about it

835
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:06,375
territory.

836
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:08,916
I'm leaving, I am the owner of that territory,

837
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:12,625
then the son who remains there has the right to live,
but not to decide.

838
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:15,083
So that's a bit of the conflict.

839
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:20,000
the conflict that is coming,

between the government and….
Of course,
because the companies arrive, oh

840
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,041
I spoke to the person who lives there! Wait a minute that's not

841
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:25,541
the son’s, nor the grandson’s.

842
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:28,958
His territory is his mother's, not that one, he

843
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:34,041
there he is taking care. And that's why there are so many conflicts,
for not understanding this.

844
00:53:34,541 --> 00:53:38,583
For me, the conflict with companies
and with all this topic

845
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:43,041
on the land, with the mining companies, with the companies
wind, is not understanding

846
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:46,041
the sense of the territory,

847
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,333
the sense of the trees, the sense of the landscape.

848
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:54,625
For the Wayuú the landscape speaks, speaks,
is telling a story,

849
00:53:54,666 --> 00:54:00,833
It is not a decorative thing: it is not a postcard
of beautiful photography to promote tourism, no.

850
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:03,708
The territory is telling you things.

851
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:07,458
So when you pass, you read the territory.

852
00:54:07,666 --> 00:54:10,958
The territory is intelligible,
has something to tell you,

853
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:15,583
It has a narrative structure
that's the territory,

854
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:19,500
something that has a narrative structure
whose pages are the floor.

855
00:54:20,416 --> 00:54:22,750
So these companies come in and say,

856
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:26,083
here we lie down, we put a bulldozer,
there is no problem,

857
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:30,375
we set up a tower
and they are tearing out the pages of a territory.

858
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:32,000
So,

859
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,041
They don't understand why they are thinking about money.

860
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:39,958
These people want money, they are asking for a lot of money
and they reduce it to a matter of money.

861
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,583
It is not a money issue.

862
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:46,625
Obviously, money will have some time
to be addressed, but it is not the essential

863
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:47,916
of the problem,

864
00:54:50,083 --> 00:55:08,000
not it

865
00:55:12,583 --> 00:55:13,208
is.

866
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:15,958
So see the whole point,

867
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,083
what's up

868
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:21,958
where there is an ontological disconnection,

869
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:25,208
For example, for companies

870
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:28,875
The winds are a mass of hot air,

871
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,416
geophysical events, inanimate,
that occur on earth

872
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:38,791
and that can generate energy: for the wayuú,
They are beings that have paths,

873
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:43,333
temperaments
and that they need to cross those paths.

874
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:47,708
A wind moves,
He does not live in a place: passes through a place.

875
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:51,958
And those paths are related to dreams,
They are related to something else.

876
00:55:52,208 --> 00:55:57,541
So how to understand the wind of business,
the wind from wind companies

877
00:55:57,958 --> 00:56:01,583
and the wayuú wind
They are two different worlds in the cosmos.

878
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:03,500
They are different.

879
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:06,416
To make those logics meet

880
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:09,125
They are disputes about the universe,

881
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:14,166
They are not disputes about development,
no, they are disputes about the universe.

882
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:14,833
So,

883
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,541
How to make them understand this?

884
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:22,250
Generally the owners of the companies,
Investors are in a hurry

885
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:25,875
they want to see their money
producing, the Wayuú have time

886
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,125
and they want to talk about this

887
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:31,291
and understand how this is not going to affect them.

888
00:56:31,791 --> 00:56:36,625
Then there is a disagreement
that, those do not understand

889
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:39,750
and they don't want to understand.

890
00:56:39,791 --> 00:56:42,541
They don't want it, they see it as a whim, superstition.

891
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:44,708
It's a backward thought,

892
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:49,041
we are modernity,
We are the reason and all this.

893
00:56:49,291 --> 00:56:52,041
This is science, they are superstition.

894
00:56:52,666 --> 00:56:55,041
So there, in that disagreement about the

895
00:56:55,375 --> 00:56:59,375
the land, over the territory,
on the landscape, on the wind,

896
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:03,208
about each tree that you are going to cut down and that was alive,

897
00:57:04,416 --> 00:57:07,208
that's where no, there hasn't been an agreement,

898
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:10,791
there has not been an agreement.

899
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:14,625
As practically in theory,
That cannot be resolved

900
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:17,291
that, I don't know, maybe there isn't one.

901
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:20,208
Of course, those are points to understand.

902
00:57:22,041 --> 00:57:24,666
We would have to see how they dialogue, how they converse.

903
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:27,791
It is always good to talk,
You cannot deny dialogue.

904
00:57:28,166 --> 00:57:30,291
You have to think about

905
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:34,958
the others, understand each other, sit down, talk

906
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:39,083
and if one can express that

907
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:42,000
But, let's see how it turns out,

908
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,916
I think that's why the president is coming from. Hopefully
He will achieve it.

909
00:57:44,958 --> 00:57:47,166
I don't know how he will do it.

910
00:57:47,208 --> 00:57:52,750
I think that
literally spending time in the territory

911
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,625
out there in a hammock,
the president there with the mosquitoes,

912
00:57:57,666 --> 00:58:01,833
with the winds here, telling them,
I think that would help a lot.

913
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:06,166
Yes, it helps, of course, he's coming to stay here for a week, a week.

914
00:58:06,333 --> 00:58:08,625
I was thinking, and I know that

915
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:12,125
this is not the point,

916
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:15,750
is that it is an ontological and

917
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:18,041
cosmology more than anything,

918
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:21,500
but I was also thinking, so yeah,

919
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:24,666
I come from that scientific ontology, although yes

920
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:28,291
I'm very involved in that other thing, but maybe also

921
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:35,000
the winds, that is,
If one would put a mill or anything and

922
00:58:36,666 --> 00:58:37,500
changes.

923
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,666
I mean, that changes the wind.

924
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:43,208
If we are in a semi-desert place, right?

925
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,166
Yes it is.

926
00:58:44,208 --> 00:58:47,125
and the winds bring water, they bring humidity

927
00:58:47,666 --> 00:58:53,833
and a single, a small change
maybe it could bring down the entire environment.

928
00:58:53,875 --> 00:58:56,000
So beyond something like that

929
00:58:56,041 --> 00:58:58,125
Of course, the Wayuú already say it

930
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,125
is one thing we don't know.

931
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:04,833
Why the importance of studies on this,
How does this affect birds?

932
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:08,916
how it affects bats that it also affects them
the,

933
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:12,166
the blades of wind energy

934
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:14,958
How does it affect the eyesight of human beings?

935
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,041
How does it affect the sound they generate?

936
00:59:17,083 --> 00:59:19,833
Because they generate a low frequency sound, I think,

937
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:24,125
But it has an impact either way.
The electrical conduction lines,

938
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:28,333
that energy must be released,
that energy can’t be isolated, they have to come out

939
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:33,000
by electrical conduction lines
which also generate white smog and energy fields.

940
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:37,458
And we must deforest and make roads
to get those lines out.

941
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:41,041
And there will be many people passing by in cars.

942
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:45,291
where before it was quiet
and the Wayuú really like their tranquility.

943
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:49,666
They go out for a walk every day

944
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:53,208
and they see a footprint, a shoe and they know who stepped on it.

945
00:59:54,041 --> 00:59:57,291
They know how their children walk, the neighbors,

946
00:59:58,916 --> 01:00:00,166
They know the…

947
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:05,083
The Wayuú have some flip flops, the waireñas, do you know them?
Wayuú footwear and that Wayuú footwear,

948
01:00:05,125 --> 01:00:07,625
Well, they are specialists in tracking footprints.

949
01:00:08,041 --> 01:00:10,416
That has been his ancient profession.

950
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:14,000
When a deer or a thing,

951
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:19,041
and they also track human footprints
and they know if I walk and tilt my foot when walking

952
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:22,166
to the left, they say ah, there goes so and so,

953
01:00:22,208 --> 01:00:25,708
because he always walks like that and they know him.

954
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:29,875
But then they are going to lose that territorial control
because many people are going to pass by

955
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:33,375
strange vehicles, with strange people
who is not indigenous and

956
01:00:33,791 --> 01:00:38,125
your sense of security, well-being,
will also be affected,

957
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:40,083
So we have to see all of that.

958
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:44,000
On the other hand,
The Wayuú have needs for health, water,

959
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:48,125
of productive projects to live their economy.

960
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:50,166
I don't know what the meeting will be like,

961
01:00:50,166 --> 01:00:53,958
there will be a dialogue,
I imagine it, and we have to see how that dialogue takes place.

962
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:56,000
Yes, yes,

963
01:00:57,083 --> 01:01:00,333
you know,

964
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:02,333
It's going to be interesting.

965
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:03,416
That's how it is.

966
01:01:03,416 --> 01:01:06,541
That makes me happy. The president is coming.

967
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:12,375
I was living in Popayán
in 2018 and 2019

968
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:15,666
and there were these big protests

969
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:17,541
and yes,

970
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:18,583
was very hard.

971
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:20,875
Hard and things

972
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:26,083
I think Duque would just have to go talk and that's it,

973
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:30,083
but promise, promise and it never came.

974
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:33,083
and they asked him to come.

975
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:35,041
and it was just a dialogue.

976
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:38,208
and Petro came this time

977
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
for own will.

978
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:41,083
He said he wanted to come to work for a week.

979
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:44,583
Well, let's see what comes of all this,
because the idea

980
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:47,666
It is seeing what results, what is achieved.

981
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:49,041
We'll see.

982
01:01:49,041 --> 01:01:51,416
But it is interesting. No?
Are you going to talk to him too?

983
01:01:52,916 --> 01:01:55,208
No, I prefer to keep distance from power.

984
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,833
I prefer to read the news

985
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,083
They called me from El tiempo (Newspaper),

986
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:07,250
and they called me yesterday from the newspaper
Time and what do you think and then they ask me

987
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:09,000
Are you a leader?

988
01:02:09,041 --> 01:02:12,208
Are you a defender of human rights?
Are you an indigenous authority? I told them

989
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:15,125
I am a solitary voice, I do not represent anyone.

990
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:16,125
To anyone.

991
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:17,208
What I speak,

992
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:19,958
I'll say it for myself, I don't even know if my children listen to me.

993
01:02:21,166 --> 01:02:22,208
I told them.

994
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:25,250
I am not and I do not want to be

995
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:27,208
leader, nor leader, nor...

996
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:29,375
It's a lot of responsibility.

997
01:02:29,416 --> 01:02:33,875
One has enough with one's own life
as to lead another's.

998
01:02:38,166 --> 01:02:39,416
There are some who

999
01:02:40,208 --> 01:02:44,041
bring knowledge, there are others who bring leadership.

1000
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:48,166
You have your role.

1001
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,791
His role and his role.

1002
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:53,500
Yes, that's the idea.

1003
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:58,833
I wanted to talk to you a little about knowing more,
because well, all that, several of those topics

1004
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:02,416
I think
We are going to talk more on Tuesday, but about that,

1005
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:06,666
from that lineage of

1006
01:03:06,708 --> 01:03:10,500
the Wayuú people, of course, are very interesting, what is it about that?

1007
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:13,916
Very interesting,
because the Wayuú kinship system

1008
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:17,000
It is based on the theory of human procreation.

1009
01:03:17,541 --> 01:03:19,833
When a man and a woman have sex,

1010
01:03:20,166 --> 01:03:23,250
The man contributes with blood,

1011
01:03:23,916 --> 01:03:27,125
the vital blood that causes the child,
semen turns to blood.

1012
01:03:27,916 --> 01:03:30,250
Then the woman provides the meat,

1013
01:03:30,291 --> 01:03:34,166
the body wrap
where the child is born, the womb.

1014
01:03:34,041 --> 01:03:37,000
So,
When a person is born, they have two families,

1015
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:40,208
a Oupayu, a father's maternal family

1016
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:45,500
and the apushi which is the mother's maternal family, then,

1017
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:49,375
This is legally important.

1018
01:03:49,416 --> 01:03:52,250
If I cause a wound to a Wayuú, I will shoot him,

1019
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:56,208
I don't kill him, the father collects the blood shed,

1020
01:03:56,708 --> 01:04:01,208
but if I kill it, as flesh is destroyed,
the body,

1021
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:05,166
then the mother's family is going to come and ask

1022
01:04:05,083 --> 01:04:08,083
the great compensation for the destruction of the flesh.

1023
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:11,333
The father can only ask
a small payment of tears.

1024
01:04:11,375 --> 01:04:13,125
What he has cried, his pain for his son.

1025
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:18,291
Then the Father is given compensation
for the little tears and He leaves.

1026
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:21,875
And then the big strong negotiation
It's with the mother's family.

1027
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:25,166
So the lands, the territory,

1028
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:31,000
the clan, practically like one's last name
It's the mom's, it's not the dad's,

1029
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:34,375
So a Wayuú will always have an orientation

1030
01:04:34,416 --> 01:04:39,500
stronger towards your uterine family
that towards the father's uterine family,

1031
01:04:39,916 --> 01:04:44,125
that is, the mother,
because the father is a boss for minor things,

1032
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:48,375
the father is a boss in the home,
food, food, education.

1033
01:04:48,791 --> 01:04:51,916
But when a problem is strong,
He is your mother's brother,

1034
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:54,458
It's your uncle who is your real boss.

1035
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:59,000
That's the boss,
because he is the one who must intervene.

1036
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:01,333
If I do something, they look for my uncle, my dad

1037
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:04,166
no, no, because he is almost a stranger.

1038
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:06,208
I mean, it's not from the same group.

1039
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:10,416
On the other hand, the lands that belong to my mother,
where my uncles live,

1040
01:05:10,916 --> 01:05:13,833
the defense, the cemetery,
everything is a function of the mother.

1041
01:05:14,375 --> 01:05:18,000
So, the Wayuú society is matrilineal,
It is oriented towards that.

1042
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,750
The father does have some duties in marriage,

1043
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:24,166
injuries, these things, and he has a role at a minor level,

1044
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:28,458
well, yes, provide the house with food,
everything any father in the world would do.

1045
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:31,125
But when the problem is serious, he is out.

1046
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:33,000
No, it can't be.

1047
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:36,250
He is his brother-in-law, he is his mother's brother,

1048
01:05:36,291 --> 01:05:40,166
the one who is the boss of his nephews,
it's stronger,

1049
01:05:40,208 --> 01:05:43,083
the uncle nephew father and son relationship.
Really?

1050
01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:45,250
Of course, of course.

1051
01:05:45,291 --> 01:05:46,208
Interesting.

1052
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:49,500
Yes, a Wayuú has to talk about who
They were your uncles and then,

1053
01:05:50,541 --> 01:05:51,500
in fact,

1054
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,166
to the uncles, they call the Wayú Ta’laüla

1055
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:55,166
I mean, my old man, my boss.

1056
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:57,375
That's my uncle. That's how it is said.

1057
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,333
It is a very close relationship.

1058
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:01,791
And in war always fighting

1059
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:04,875
Uncle’s side.

1060
01:06:05,125 --> 01:06:06,875
Even if the father's family

1061
01:06:06,875 --> 01:06:10,958
goes to war with the mother's family,
The Wayuú must take their mother's side,

1062
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,541
necessarily on that side.

1063
01:06:15,291 --> 01:06:19,791
There is a story in a Wayuú song of a war that took place,

1064
01:06:21,041 --> 01:06:25,458
They loved their father very much, these Wayuú,
and for some reason the families went to war,

1065
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:29,125
that these are long families,
and the father died in combat

1066
01:06:29,958 --> 01:06:32,083
and they asked permission to the enemies

1067
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:35,166
to go cry to their father and they accepted them.

1068
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:38,166
Then they said let's make a truce
so that you can come to cry at your

1069
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:38,916
Dad because he was

1070
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:42,458
their dad and peace came because of that, so it's a story

1071
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:46,416
very cute.

1072
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:49,958
So this must be understood,
Companies do not understand this,

1073
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:55,666
They don't understand this, they don't understand
this form of kinship and they are, and why?

1074
01:06:55,708 --> 01:06:59,208
what is this? And your last name? and not.

1075
01:07:01,041 --> 01:07:02,916
This is how the network is woven,

1076
01:07:02,958 --> 01:07:06,208
wayuú social organization
and that has to do with the land.

1077
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:10,000
The earth is feminine, the earth is feminine,

1078
01:07:10,041 --> 01:07:14,750
the rain, the rain that fertilizes
the earth is hyper masculine.

1079
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:18,208
So rain is the most masculine thing there can be,

1080
01:07:18,666 --> 01:07:21,250
because it is what fertilizes the earth, the earth is what

1081
01:07:22,041 --> 01:07:24,375
what bears, what is fruitful, what is fertile.

1082
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:29,041
The earth is life,
but the masculine is what fertilizes life.

1083
01:07:29,416 --> 01:07:33,000
Then look at all that beautiful relationship
that must be understood.

1084
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:36,541
So for them the earth is fixed,

1085
01:07:37,583 --> 01:07:41,458
This is a place, but the rain is mobile,
the rain is watered

1086
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:45,875
and fertilizes the earth, the lands in plural,

1087
01:07:45,916 --> 01:07:49,416
the lands, because each woman is a land.

1088
01:07:50,125 --> 01:07:54,458
Yes, each territory
It has its own history, its own place,

1089
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,875
then more than the earth as a unit
that does exist at a mythological level, it is called Mma.

1090
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:04,041
There are also
specific lands or places

1091
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:09,541
to which one is associated
and that are represented in the cemetery housing axis.

1092
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:13,791
This is why cemeteries are so important.
and that's why Vito's poem says

1093
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:16,083
what he said, there is your shadow and you rest.

1094
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:21,416
You can leave and you can not come back,
but there is the tree in your cemetery.

1095
01:08:21,458 --> 01:08:22,125
In wayaqui apushi

1096
01:08:24,833 --> 01:08:26,500
Yes, apushi.

1097
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:30,375
Yes, apushi is relatives, it is like part,

1098
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:33,708
It's part uterine relative, yes,

1099
01:08:33,833 --> 01:08:37,916
but a nest is like the family unit, not the clan.

1100
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:40,250
The clan is called E´iruku and clan means meat.

1101
01:08:41,291 --> 01:08:45,041
Not all members of a clan are family.

1102
01:08:45,458 --> 01:08:46,708
They are like surnames.

1103
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:49,500
Like someone's last name is Smith.

1104
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:53,416
There are many Smiths in the world, but those who were born in

1105
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:56,833
Cabo de la Vela
They are one and the ones who are in such a place.

1106
01:08:56,875 --> 01:09:00,791
So when the land serves as your last name
and you say no,

1107
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:03,750
I am Uriana from xxxxx

1108
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:07,875
a Wayuú place called like that,
that has a cemetery,

1109
01:09:07,916 --> 01:09:10,583
a source of water, a territory, a history.

1110
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,916
It is then, that one is different, those do act in war.
The others can be recognized, Ah!

1111
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:20,416
We share the clan, but we are not family,
we only have an mythological relationship

1112
01:09:21,583 --> 01:09:24,166
and the clan not only of humans.

1113
01:09:25,208 --> 01:09:27,125
The clan involves non-humans,

1114
01:09:28,875 --> 01:09:32,166
because for example

1115
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:35,958
well, the Uriana ones are from the jaguar and the rabbit,

1116
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:39,666
They are animals that belong to the clan.

1117
01:09:40,083 --> 01:09:43,208
Some hills and some trees.

1118
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,166
The trees are numerous as is a numerous clan,
The trees that are numerous are from that clan.

1119
01:09:48,916 --> 01:09:53,166
So there are humans, animals and plants
and even hills in one of this clans.

1120
01:09:54,166 --> 01:09:58,708
Well that, that's what you're talking about,
that everything was human.

1121
01:09:58,791 --> 01:09:59,500
Everything was human.

1122
01:09:59,541 --> 01:10:02,166
That's where the kinship comes from, that in time,

1123
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:05,916
in the reference time,

1124
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:08,791
Australians have a time called
The Age of Dream

1125
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,333
and the Coyoacán of Alaska
They have a time called distant time.

1126
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:18,291
The Wayuú call that time wayuu sumaiwa,

1127
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:21,250
sumaiwa, at one time,

1128
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:27,166
but in the West we tend to confuse that time
with the past, because stories begin like that.

1129
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:30,833
There was a time
and people think it's the past, it's not the past.

1130
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:34,541
They are transhistorical times that go through history.

1131
01:10:36,125 --> 01:10:37,625
Native populance

1132
01:10:37,625 --> 01:10:40,708
they can have notions of time
where the past is ahead

1133
01:10:41,875 --> 01:10:46,333
or a mythical time until
forward, forward time or parallel times.

1134
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:50,583
And how do you do it between everyday time
and that time?

1135
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:55,375
Through dream, ritual and landscape.

1136
01:10:55,416 --> 01:10:58,500
That's what makes those time levels
become accessible

1137
01:10:58,541 --> 01:11:02,208
at the current time,
that young people can meet those things.

1138
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:07,083
So to understand the person in the world
Wayuú, to understand the territories,

1139
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:10,708
to understand living beings,
everything is explained in time.

1140
01:11:12,041 --> 01:11:15,791
So

1141
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:18,666
Yes, a Wayuú, he dies like today,

1142
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:22,250
that Wayuú himself is going to convert

1143
01:11:22,333 --> 01:11:26,333
on a tree or a hill or whatever, or…

1144
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:30,125
He first takes a trip through the Milky Way,

1145
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:35,333
a long trip and you arrive at Jepira, another world.

1146
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:39,958
He will arrive there with his cattle,
the one who was killed at his wake,

1147
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:44,458
the souls of sacrificed animals
at the wake, goats, cows,

1148
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,375
sheep, accompany him.

1149
01:11:46,416 --> 01:11:48,583
He needs those cattle to live there

1150
01:11:49,166 --> 01:11:51,625
and wants to maintain the status he had

1151
01:11:51,666 --> 01:11:54,708
here, he wants to keep it there.

1152
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:57,166
After a while,

1153
01:11:57,041 --> 01:11:59,125
his soul begins to dilute,

1154
01:11:59,166 --> 01:12:01,791
begins to lose like life within death

1155
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,875
and comes back like rain

1156
01:12:04,916 --> 01:12:08,125
to start a life cycle and all this

1157
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:11,208
kind of things.

1158
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:14,250
But, the kinship we have with plants,

1159
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:19,000
with animals, it comes from human traits
and from that mythical time when they were human.

1160
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:21,250
That's why they are cosmic relatives.

1161
01:12:21,291 --> 01:12:24,208
Are they all cosmic relatives, are they different

1162
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:28,041
practically what humans today?

1163
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:33,083
If today's humans have an advantage
that were not transformed,

1164
01:12:33,125 --> 01:12:36,791
preserve appearance and language
that they had at that time.

1165
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:39,625
Humans are the only untransformed beings.

1166
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:41,750
They transformed into other humans.

1167
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:44,958
Horses are fallen humans, ex-humans,

1168
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:48,875
but we are the only beings
not transformed.

1169
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:53,000
We remain as if in time itself.

1170
01:12:58,083 --> 01:12:59,875
That was my doctoral thesis.

1171
01:12:59,916 --> 01:13:02,083
If we read a little about that.

1172
01:13:02,125 --> 01:13:04,041
Ontology.
is a big thesis.

1173
01:13:04,083 --> 01:13:06,375
I wrote it in Canada, among other things.

1174
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:07,083
Really?

1175
01:13:07,333 --> 01:13:11,791
It's funny because, well,
our Peru documentary just won

1176
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:17,791
best documentary of a Canadian film festival
and they are going to bring me there

1177
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:21,291
July 14.
¿
Where in?

1178
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:24,791
At xxxx, at the lake

1179
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:26,000
Ont.

1180
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:32,125
I was in Ontario, I was in there,
There I was touring all those territories.

1181
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:33,708
How beautiful the big lakes are there.

1182
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:39,041
There is a lake in xxxx that is bigger than La Guajira

1183
01:13:39,083 --> 01:13:41,125
24,0000 thousand kilometers.

1184
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:42,000
We toured it,

1185
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
well, not everything.

1186
01:13:43,041 --> 01:13:46,375
I was with the communities
indigenous. There is an indigenous

1187
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:49,083
geologist, has a Ph.D.

1188
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:52,916
in geology and in general very, very prepared

1189
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:56,750
all the leaders,
but I knew pollution problems from Mercury.

1190
01:13:57,250 --> 01:14:02,750
We were in an area called Grassi Narrow.

1191
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:04,166
There, there I was.

1192
01:14:04,166 --> 01:14:06,375
I have photos there.

1193
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:09,291
Well there were cold days,

1194
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:12,958
terribly cold.

1195
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:13,666
started to enter

1196
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:16,791
After the heat, I saw dams.

1197
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:21,083
We met, we worked on common problems.

1198
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:23,083
I brought water from the ranchería.

1199
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,250
From the River here.

1200
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:26,375
And we watered it there in Lake Ontario

1201
01:14:26,416 --> 01:14:29,000
and they had brought water here from Ontario

1202
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:31,083
and we had watered it
here in Riohacha, there in the ranchería.

1203
01:14:31,125 --> 01:14:32,083
It's called Exchange

1204
01:14:32,083 --> 01:14:35,916
of water.

1205
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:38,125
I love Canada.

1206
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:41,166
Yeah, well, I'm from there, from Ohio.

1207
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:43,083
It's close, there in front.

1208
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:47,166
And we crossed the border and Lake Iris is my lake.

1209
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:49,041
I mean, yes, the government here.

1210
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:02,916
We toured

1211
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:05,666
by boat seeing other lakes

1212
01:15:06,166 --> 01:15:10,500
drawings, hieroglyphs that are there in areas.

1213
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:15,583
Look, here I am with an indigenous Canadian

1214
01:15:16,833 --> 01:15:17,291
there,

1215
01:15:17,333 --> 01:15:19,083
that

1216
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,791
It's in a camp.

1217
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:28,708
Very dear, her name is Leona
and this is touring the mountains.

1218
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,125
The mountains in Canada.

1219
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:39,875
And we sleep with firewood and it's cold at night.

1220
01:15:39,916 --> 01:15:41,208
Look here we go

1221
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,458
touring the lake.

1222
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,750
What the lake

1223
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:48,000
that the overcrowded
there where they have the pollution problem.

1224
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:52,083
This is in Winnipeg we were seeing the rivers,

1225
01:15:52,125 --> 01:15:54,416
the rivers. AND.

1226
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:56,333
All that.

1227
01:15:56,375 --> 01:15:58,875
Ah, look, here in monuments then.

1228
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:02,125
Oh, they are a beautiful monument of.

1229
01:16:02,166 --> 01:16:04,208
The indigenous people there.

1230
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:07,500
And what organization was that?

1231
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:10,000
That those are the indigenous people you were watching.

1232
01:16:10,041 --> 01:16:14,125
Is that so? Yeah.

1233
01:16:14,166 --> 01:16:14,541
Let me see.

1234
01:16:14,541 --> 01:16:18,291
I'm going to bring it here.

1235
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:19,000
And they say

1236
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:22,916
Oh, more than

1237
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:33,250
that is. Oh,

1238
01:16:34,458 --> 01:16:39,125
from there you come out

1239
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:42,916
This was the bank of a river.

1240
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:44,500
On time. On time.

1241
01:16:44,541 --> 01:16:47,750
It was about two hours from Winnipeg.

1242
01:16:48,125 --> 01:16:50,375
and it arrived

1243
01:16:50,416 --> 01:16:51,083
for.

1244
01:16:51,125 --> 01:16:55,375
Do something.

1245
01:16:55,416 --> 01:16:59,291
They already saw it

1246
01:16:59,333 --> 01:17:01,750
the first

1247
01:17:03,458 --> 01:17:04,000
years?

1248
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:06,958
Yes, Yes. This was good.

1249
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,958
A beautiful tour in the.

1250
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,166
Lagos, throughout that area.

1251
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:15,208
Yes. And I loved this.

1252
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:18,000
I took one. Photo.

1253
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:22,041
in a sculpture
which has books by indigenous authors.

1254
01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:25,125
It's called Education

1255
01:17:25,125 --> 01:17:28,291
is the new horizon.

1256
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:31,333
All these books are by indigenous authors,
those who are there.

1257
01:17:31,875 --> 01:17:35,208
And I loved the motto
Education is the new horizon.

1258
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:38,708
Yes it is a good name
Yes it is very

1259
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:41,166
Nice experience in Canada.

1260
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:44,250
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, with everyone.

1261
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:46,375
the problems, the

1262
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:48,750
Beautiful things and landscapes

1263
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:50,791
and monuments

1264
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:55,125
to indigenous people, to indigenous women
that are lost, there are also dramas,

1265
01:17:55,083 --> 01:18:00,041
the boarding schools, the children who were lost
in church boarding schools,

1266
01:18:01,125 --> 01:18:03,166
thousands of children, thousands.

1267
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:04,791
Changed.

1268
01:18:04,833 --> 01:18:07,416
For the Wayuú have influenced them,

1269
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:11,041
in the sense that when Covid,

1270
01:18:11,083 --> 01:18:15,625
hospitals began to cremate
the bodies of Wayuú women and our bodies

1271
01:18:15,666 --> 01:18:19,708
They are sacred, they have to go to the cemetery
because they are going to be cremated and they dressed in red

1272
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:24,625
To deny death, women dressed in
red and they made a march dressed in red.

1273
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:30,541
Well, they took the red of the Wayuú to
also protest for missing women.

1274
01:18:31,166 --> 01:18:36,666
Then look how it influenced
one thing influenced others,
trans American?

1275
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:39,083
Yes, yes, yes, that's right.

1276
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:41,041
This is the Winnipeg Human Rights Museum.

1277
01:18:41,041 --> 01:18:41,958
Which is beautiful.

1278
01:18:41,958 --> 01:18:44,041
Here I am in Winnipeg.

1279
01:18:44,083 --> 01:18:47,625
That's the museum.
Yes Yes.

1280
01:18:50,208 --> 01:18:52,666
Oh yeah?

1281
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:54,166
Then no?

1282
01:18:54,208 --> 01:18:57,166
Well I see. That the idea is there.

1283
01:18:57,250 --> 01:19:00,333
The stories are there,

1284
01:19:00,375 --> 01:19:02,875
they are on Earth

1285
01:19:04,708 --> 01:19:07,166
to make a documentary about the Wayuú land.

1286
01:19:07,208 --> 01:19:12,250
It implies all this that we have talked about,
I don't know, seeing her as a non-perfect being.

1287
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:15,208
Not perfect. Mysterious.

1288
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:19,125
And that mystery of the land that the Wayuú say

1289
01:19:19,666 --> 01:19:22,625
entails the transformation of all beings
that we inhabit it

1290
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:26,000
and reflects the idea that life

1291
01:19:26,708 --> 01:19:28,791
It is a product of the intention of the place.

1292
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:31,916
Yes, life itself

1293
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:35,000
It is that product of intention
of a place where we live.

1294
01:19:36,125 --> 01:19:40,208
And his relationship with his sister the sea,

1295
01:19:41,125 --> 01:19:43,875
that is angry,
He has a bit of a strong temperament.

1296
01:19:44,708 --> 01:19:48,208
and sometimes the two collide
and then she invades this one.

1297
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:52,208
The sea comes in and invades the coast

1298
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:58,041
and she has to take fire to make her retreat
to its shores and place of origin

1299
01:19:59,083 --> 01:20:00,083
through fire.

1300
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:01,166
It's the only thing he's afraid of.

1301
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:06,041
I see her, then she comes back,
It withdraws and returns to its shores, where it should be.

1302
01:20:07,041 --> 01:20:09,166
All of these are beautiful Wayuú stories.

1303
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:15,125
Yes, very beautiful Wayuú stories.

1304
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:20,333
Well, I think it's like a last
Question

Ready
and I think we should go.

1305
01:20:20,375 --> 01:20:26,083
But like that thing about the palabreros
which ones, who are they?

1306
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:26,750
And well.

1307
01:20:26,791 --> 01:20:29,541
You don't know my book, The Dispute and the Word?

1308
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:32,250
well, I haven't read it.

1309
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:35,958
Yes, if you want to know about them you should read my book.

1310
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,625
The dispute and the word, The law in the Wayuú society,
It was what I first investigated many years ago.

1311
01:20:41,125 --> 01:20:45,208
The palabreros are intermediaries

1312
01:20:46,666 --> 01:20:49,000
who manage the Wayuú normative system,

1313
01:20:49,208 --> 01:20:52,708
They are facilitators like “go between” and that figure

1314
01:20:53,166 --> 01:20:57,000
then they move
between a family, every damage

1315
01:20:58,375 --> 01:21:00,208
moral, an offense that I do to you

1316
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:03,791
or any physical damage, a wound that I
cause you, all theft

1317
01:21:04,083 --> 01:21:06,208
What I do to you must be compensated.

1318
01:21:07,041 --> 01:21:12,250
The Wayuú do not believe in prison,
There is no corporal punishment, no, it is payment.

1319
01:21:12,916 --> 01:21:17,125
So that's not done directly.
and I don't charge you.

1320
01:21:17,166 --> 01:21:21,083
I send a person specialized in that,
in fixing,

1321
01:21:21,666 --> 01:21:25,208
to express my complaint
before your family gathered together.

1322
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:29,041
It is not a problem between individuals,
No, it's between families.

1323
01:21:29,541 --> 01:21:34,125
The individual is not seen in isolation,
but immersed in a group of relatives.

1324
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:39,833
So my problem is not with him,
It is against the entire group to which he belongs,

1325
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,916
his brothers, sisters, uncles, maternal,
but uterine, maternal.

1326
01:21:45,791 --> 01:21:48,625
That is why it is so important
the concept of apushi among the Wayuú

1327
01:21:50,166 --> 01:21:51,333
and he goes,

1328
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:55,166
He comes and goes, weaves peace between the parties.

1329
01:21:55,208 --> 01:22:00,416
That doesn't get solved right away.
That can take days, weeks.

1330
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:05,666
sometimes they set up a meeting,
They come back and reach the agreement and that's it

1331
01:22:05,708 --> 01:22:08,291
when they achieve that there is a will to pay for the fault,

1332
01:22:08,833 --> 01:22:11,541
then they go in to see how much it is

1333
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:15,333
and that is paid in animals, necklaces.

1334
01:22:16,208 --> 01:22:20,583
If it is a gun wound,
I must ask for the murder weapon.

1335
01:22:20,625 --> 01:22:22,708
If he was killed, that weapon

1336
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:23,541
It must be delivered to me

1337
01:22:23,541 --> 01:22:27,625
first of all,
the weapon is the first thing that is requested

1338
01:22:27,666 --> 01:22:31,458
and it is the will of peace, hand over the weapon,
So they rule.

1339
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:34,583
the weapon, it already means that they want peace
because they sent the weapon.

1340
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:38,291
The weapon must be taken out of circulation
of the things of the world

1341
01:22:39,083 --> 01:22:41,208
because it hurts and has hurt.

1342
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:46,125
It has something of the soul of the dead,
and the dead man has something of the weapon inside,

1343
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:50,708
there is an exchange of substances,
then the payments are signed.

1344
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:57,041
Some payments have no material meaning,
but of ornament, of aesthetics.

1345
01:22:57,083 --> 01:23:02,083
The necklace goes as an ornament, a luxury of payment.

1346
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:07,041
They have the notion of luxury, which is luxury,
what is the decoration,

1347
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:11,708
what is the aesthetic, the compensation
It doesn't have to be enough, it has to be beautiful.

1348
01:23:12,208 --> 01:23:15,083
The compensation is a necklace

1349
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:17,208
and the necklace is made with cattle,

1350
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:20,458
necklaces and strange animals like mules

1351
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,333
Generally the Wayuú ask

1352
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:25,708
two mules They can ask for 100 cows,

1353
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:31,625
200 goats, 200 goats,
but the two mules are done like this,

1354
01:23:31,666 --> 01:23:36,125
because mules are hybrids that cannot be found
easily in the universe.

1355
01:23:36,166 --> 01:23:39,250
A horse and a mare or a donkey.

1356
01:23:39,291 --> 01:23:42,541
No, sorry,
a horse and a donkey, or a donkey and a mare.

1357
01:23:43,208 --> 01:23:48,041
Then the mules decorate the payment.

1358
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:52,875
Two mules is not a large amount,
but since they are rare like necklaces,

1359
01:23:53,166 --> 01:23:55,875
They serve to decorate the payment,

1360
01:23:55,916 --> 01:23:59,000
So there I can deliver the 200 now

1361
01:23:59,791 --> 01:24:00,541
goats.

1362
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:05,375
Or they give me deadlines,
because it's not about ruining the other,

1363
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,541
but the other

1364
01:24:08,583 --> 01:24:10,583
Has to be prudent in their conduct.

1365
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:13,791
And he tells you, I'm going to pay this this year.

1366
01:24:14,375 --> 01:24:18,875
and I will wait for my animals to reproduce
to be able to give you

1367
01:24:18,916 --> 01:24:24,000
the other year of the animals that were born this year
that the goats give birth up to three times,

1368
01:24:24,416 --> 01:24:29,000
then they deliver, and then the other
He does not want to destroy him nor does he want him to go to prison.

1369
01:24:29,041 --> 01:24:32,833
The Wayuú say what good is it to me that my enemy
be imprisoned

1370
01:24:33,083 --> 01:24:35,791
If there they are going to give you free food and free time?

1371
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:41,000
I want him free to work
and pay me.

1372
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:46,250
Then they go to jail,
They see it as something barbaric, uncivilized.

1373
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:49,208
They have to say that prison is an uncivilized place.

1374
01:24:49,666 --> 01:24:54,208
and says because justice is not revenge,
justice is

1375
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:57,125
reopen social relations

1376
01:24:58,125 --> 01:25:00,583
that were broken by someone's act.

1377
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:02,166
Such as a theft.

1378
01:25:02,208 --> 01:25:05,041
Or a homicide, an injury, an offense.

1379
01:25:05,125 --> 01:25:08,291
So the Wayuú try to restore
like a fabric.

1380
01:25:08,916 --> 01:25:12,166
When I have a hole in a fabric and I pick up a needle

1381
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:15,750
and I darn it again
so that the fabric is the same again.

1382
01:25:15,791 --> 01:25:18,958
This is Wayuú justice, it is restorative,

1383
01:25:19,083 --> 01:25:23,083
It is not punitive, it does not emphasize punishment
the penalty.

1384
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:27,166
No!  emphasizes restoration
of broken social relationships.

1385
01:25:27,583 --> 01:25:32,208
The palabrero handles the rhetoric,
has to be persuasive.

1386
01:25:32,666 --> 01:25:38,041
Their task is to convince and a conflict is settled
when both win.

1387
01:25:39,083 --> 01:25:41,583
No one can feel bad.

1388
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:46,041
If they pay me for a relative's injury,
My prestige remains intact.

1389
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:47,875
I have made myself respected.

1390
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:50,166
If I pay

1391
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:55,125
what a relative did, the other family says,
They know how to pay.

1392
01:25:55,666 --> 01:25:57,375
Their young people can make a mistake.

1393
01:25:57,375 --> 01:26:01,125
But these people have responsible behavior,
Serious.

1394
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:03,083
They are good people.

1395
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:06,583
If something happens to me later, to a family member of mine

1396
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:11,166
It is said that they are going to pay me because I am used to
pay for the faults.

1397
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:15,083
Then I keep a collective resume,
not of the individual, but of the family.

1398
01:26:15,416 --> 01:26:20,208
And that resume
He says if, on the other hand, I don't pay, I don't fix it,

1399
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:24,458
I put myself outside the Wayuú law, there is no police,
There are no judges, there is no problem.

1400
01:26:25,208 --> 01:26:28,125
But someone more powerful than me comes, runs over me

1401
01:26:28,958 --> 01:26:32,250
and I try to pay and they tell me, whoever doesn't know how to pay

1402
01:26:32,291 --> 01:26:36,500
should not charge,
because you humiliated a humble indigenous person

1403
01:26:36,541 --> 01:26:41,708
long ago, I was a fisherman perhaps
and you ran over him and did nothing.

1404
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:43,291
Now how do you come to complain?

1405
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:47,000
So I pay to be inside
of the rules of the game of society.

1406
01:26:47,166 --> 01:26:51,083
I don't need police, nor magistrate, nor judges
Make me pay this.

1407
01:26:51,125 --> 01:26:52,333
I do it voluntarily.

1408
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:52,958
So that?

1409
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,666
to be inside
of the rules of the game of a society.

1410
01:26:55,875 --> 01:26:59,791
It's more or less the payment.

1411
01:26:59,833 --> 01:27:00,541
Very good.

1412
01:27:01,166 --> 01:27:03,083
But if you want to know more, read my book.

1413
01:27:03,333 --> 01:27:05,125
Yes, yes, of course.

1414
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:06,083
The dispute and the word.

1415
01:27:06,083 --> 01:27:08,125
The law in Wayuú society.

1416
01:27:08,166 --> 01:27:10,541
Yes, of course.

1417
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:13,291
I do not know if. I have it on hand.

1418
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,500
I don't know if I have it here.

1419
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:24,791
Sometimes one doesn't, I don't know,

1420
01:27:25,416 --> 01:27:31,458
I have one of those...

1421
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:42,041
is this!

1422
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:44,208
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes,

1423
01:27:44,875 --> 01:27:45,708
yes, that's it.

1424
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:48,750
And these are the palabreros. Here are the pictures.

1425
01:27:49,166 --> 01:27:50,666
This old man, this book of my son's

1426
01:27:50,666 --> 01:27:55,833
These are the palabreros, look at them

1427
01:27:56,958 --> 01:27:58,375
the wayuú palabreros.

1428
01:27:59,125 --> 01:28:02,041
That generation that I filmed, most of them have already died.

1429
01:28:03,125 --> 01:28:07,166
I photographed it with a friend in 1998.

1430
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:10,166
99, my idol, old Isidro.

1431
01:28:10,208 --> 01:28:10,958
Very good

1432
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:13,708
Palabrero, Gómez died two years ago.

1433
01:28:13,958 --> 01:28:15,541
Or three years.

1434
01:28:15,583 --> 01:28:18,166
This my friend Angel Amaya,
The greatest of all.

1435
01:28:18,541 --> 01:28:21,083
Yeah. They are going to release him now.

1436
01:28:21,708 --> 01:28:24,791
His years of dead next year in a few days,
and then they are going to take it out.

1437
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:27,375
This was my great friend,
that was my trusted palabrero

1438
01:28:27,416 --> 01:28:31,708
because I was Secretary of Indigenous Affairs
and he was my right hand.

1439
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:36,125
I solved the problems with him
through him, we

1440
01:28:36,166 --> 01:28:38,541
we met and, we worked.

1441
01:28:38,583 --> 01:28:41,458
This was my uncle Guillermo Estrada,
a great palabrero.

1442
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:44,750
This Néstor Polanco lived in Uribia and

1443
01:28:45,875 --> 01:28:48,083
another very famous palabrero,

1444
01:28:48,125 --> 01:28:51,250
This is the old xxx, a good talker.

1445
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:54,375
This one still lives, he lives.

1446
01:28:54,416 --> 01:28:56,583
The only one who lives is called Ismael Parra

1447
01:28:56,625 --> 01:29:00,208
He is very old now and taught me many things.

1448
01:29:00,666 --> 01:29:02,458
He died Saraucana.

1449
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:05,125
This one did live, this is my cousin.

1450
01:29:05,166 --> 01:29:06,500
And he lives.

1451
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:09,791
He is Carlos Curbelo, but he is not a palabrero,
he has been in conflicts.

1452
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:12,166
I put him in because he knows a lot about war.

1453
01:29:12,208 --> 01:29:12,625
He died.

1454
01:29:12,625 --> 01:29:16,166
King Said Juana.

1455
01:29:16,208 --> 01:29:18,750
This is the cane that too.

1456
01:29:19,041 --> 01:29:20,416
There is another because there are many varieties.

1457
01:29:20,416 --> 01:29:22,333
Not everyone has this.

1458
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:27,166
That bird could be a simple stick with nothing.

1459
01:29:27,208 --> 01:29:28,041
This is my friend Ángel.

1460
01:29:28,041 --> 01:29:29,916
These are paid collars.

1461
01:29:29,958 --> 01:29:32,291
Look it here.

1462
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:36,166
A conflict has two solutions.

1463
01:29:36,208 --> 01:29:42,166
Either the war that the staff represents or peace
which represents the necklace.

1464
01:29:42,083 --> 01:29:47,083
That is, human beings always face a dispute
between groups, we go for dialogue,

1465
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:50,125
peace or we go down that hard path.

1466
01:29:50,541 --> 01:29:54,416
Then look, the photo is very beautiful.

1467
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:57,166
The picture is beautiful and that’s my pal

1468
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:59,291
He was a wise man, he was a wise man.

1469
01:29:59,291 --> 01:30:02,166
I talked to him for hours and hours and he told me so many

1470
01:30:02,208 --> 01:30:03,625
things and me

1471
01:30:03,625 --> 01:30:06,250
He explained stories about him, settling conflicts.

1472
01:30:06,291 --> 01:30:08,416
Difficulties, everything he

1473
01:30:09,166 --> 01:30:13,625
He lived, how hard it was for him to fix something
and how he finally solved it.

1474
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:18,000
These are the payment collars, he is there.

1475
01:30:18,041 --> 01:30:22,708
The palabrero must know the value of the necklaces,
because with this you reach the

1476
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,500
agreements, then.

1477
01:30:24,541 --> 01:30:26,583
There are necklaces that are made of sea coral.

1478
01:30:27,125 --> 01:30:29,666
Or gold corals.

1479
01:30:29,708 --> 01:30:32,291
Basically, archaeological accounts.

1480
01:30:32,333 --> 01:30:33,333
So

1481
01:30:33,375 --> 01:30:35,541
This is her daughter getting ready there on a table.

1482
01:30:35,583 --> 01:30:39,833
This is how they arrange themselves when there is going to be a payment, they get
and the necklaces are displayed so that the other party

1483
01:30:39,875 --> 01:30:44,041
see them and examine if they are happy,
if you are getting a good necklace,

1484
01:30:44,541 --> 01:30:47,625
You can reject some or accept others or all of that.

1485
01:30:47,875 --> 01:30:49,208
Or ask for a specific one?

1486
01:30:49,208 --> 01:30:54,000
If you don't want such a necklace,
then they look for it and bring it,

1487
01:30:54,041 --> 01:30:58,083
and this is what women keep
so when there are wars in the family to be able to pay.

1488
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:01,625
Generally women guard them. Yeah

1489
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,166
is that it?

1490
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,291
that's the bird

1491
01:31:08,458 --> 01:31:10,666
the first palabrero, the one that brings Utta.

1492
01:31:11,791 --> 01:31:13,833
innelus ruficollis

1493
01:31:13,875 --> 01:31:17,750
It is called in Latin innelus ruficollis .

1494
01:31:17,791 --> 01:31:18,708
Yes, and there is another.

1495
01:31:18,708 --> 01:31:22,458
Even he has a necklace here on his chest.

1496
01:31:23,166 --> 01:31:25,375
Because when he

1497
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:30,500
Mareiwa one of the great Wayuú beings, an instructor,
A mythical figure told him, I want

1498
01:31:30,541 --> 01:31:34,458
You to give the humans
the laws to live in society.

1499
01:31:34,958 --> 01:31:38,291
He retired to the mountain and brought the laws.

1500
01:31:38,791 --> 01:31:39,625
And Mareiwa

1501
01:31:39,625 --> 01:31:43,125
liked it and told him
I'm going to reward you with two things, a necklace,

1502
01:31:43,291 --> 01:31:47,083
because you did your job very well
and the gift of good humor.

1503
01:31:47,125 --> 01:31:50,083
The bird's song sounds like human laughter.

1504
01:31:50,416 --> 01:31:54,291
You feel it like
laughing, when he is around it is like a laugh.

1505
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:59,666
And then, because these beings consider that
The best gift for a human being is good humor.

1506
01:32:00,833 --> 01:32:01,541
Keep a.

1507
01:32:01,541 --> 01:32:03,833
Attitude.

1508
01:32:03,875 --> 01:32:05,500
This is a tree

1509
01:32:05,541 --> 01:32:08,250
Trupillo?
Let me see. It could be a trick.

1510
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:10,125
Yes, I think so.

1511
01:32:10,166 --> 01:32:13,333
A little trick, which is very good.

1512
01:32:14,583 --> 01:32:16,625
Each tree is a story among the Wayuú

1513
01:32:16,666 --> 01:32:19,791
That's why it's good to know what it is. What tree is it?

1514
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:26,250
And here are interviews that I did with him,

1515
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:28,916
In addition to the analysis that I did as an anthropologist.

1516
01:32:28,958 --> 01:32:30,333
Of the whole topic.

1517
01:32:30,375 --> 01:32:34,833
I felt that I was facing a generation
of beings that were going to leave

1518
01:32:35,666 --> 01:32:40,375
and I interviewed them and made an annex of interviews,
where I asked them and they

1519
01:32:40,416 --> 01:32:41,750
They answered.

1520
01:32:42,708 --> 01:32:45,666
Well, that's my book about the sea,

1521
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:48,958
I worked with Wayuú fishermen,
the fishing theme,

1522
01:32:49,958 --> 01:32:53,458
the animals, the seascape,
because there is a landscape at the bottom of the

1523
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:56,125
Sea and then the Wayuú classify them.

1524
01:32:56,166 --> 01:32:57,666
They have their knowledge.

1525
01:32:57,708 --> 01:33:00,916
Of the winds, as the winds are.

1526
01:33:01,166 --> 01:33:05,041
The Archaeological Museum of Aruba published that to me.
