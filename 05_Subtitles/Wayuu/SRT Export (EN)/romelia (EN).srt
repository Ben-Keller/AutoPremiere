1
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:25,583
What does that mean?

2
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,583
symbols that are being put?

3
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,708
ah, what I'm going to place here.

4
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,833
It is the symbol of the sun

5
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,541
here

6
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,291
and

7
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:41,333
this.

8
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,541
Is

9
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,666
the same.

10
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,666
AND

11
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:33,958
these.

12
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,458
These paintings are going to be for parties only.

13
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and they are like, they are the fine ones

14
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,250
because there are others too, kind of…

15
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,791
as for daily and this is it,

16
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:48,291
which is a

17
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,291
kind of canned powder.

18
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,833
Is this.

19
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,958
And where does the dust come from?

20
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,750
It is from female tree fungus species

21
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,416
that they produce from the mountains and that occurs when it is already winter.

22
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,541
By

23
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,083
when it is cold, that produces the cold

24
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,875
species of mushrooms. It has its time

25
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,875
in winter, that happens in November.

26
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,000
So

27
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,125
can you introduce yourself, who are you, what do you really do?

28
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:50,916
I introduce myself,

29
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,208
my name is Romelia Montiel,

30
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:56,666
I am the one who knows the Kayushipana community here in Alta

31
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,666
Guajira Nazareth

32
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,750
I belong to the Uriana clan,

33
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,291
I am from, my origin

34
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,416
It's there on the hill that's back there.

35
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,416
Sekuolu (name of the hill)

36
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,541
So I'm going to talk about medicinal plants,

37
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:17,458
to a few species of plants that are here, uff

38
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,583
there is still more

39
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,541
that is, still

40
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,333
There is after this and there is still more.

41
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,583
The one who keeps it, Macuira, is our grandmother.

42
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:29,500
It's where they were all born, it's where they spawned

43
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,916
God to us so that this plant

44
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,333
will stay here with us, because all this

45
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,333
They were humans before us.

46
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,416
That's why it has its magic, it has its spirit.

47
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:45,375
We respect them, we respect them a lot

48
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,708
that we still preserve the ancestral tradition.

49
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,208
As,

50
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:52,625
as already

51
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,875
I have done a lot of research,

52
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:57,250
my research is so deep for many years

53
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,291
It is behind everything, not only in the medicinal plant

54
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
but in everything that has to do with our culture

55
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,125
ancestral.

56
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:09,125
How have you investigated? What is the method?

57
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,083
I have investigated with the old men of Macuira

58
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,458
that there are a few

59
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,458
that no longer exist here on earth, they are with daddy God

60
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,166
and those who are left after them

61
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,250
They are the grandchildren, the grandparents.

62
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,541
That's why I keep them.

63
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,916
My grandmothers are also people who are

64
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,125
They like all this,

65
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,125
They are people who have spirit too.

66
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:31,958
Are

67
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:36,125
shamans, they are spiritualists and all that, they are like us

68
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,291
we call it Outsü.

69
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:40,041
We the Wayuu indigenous people, Outsü.

70
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,708
because it's called Outsü, because that one comes

71
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,291
of vision, of vision.

72
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,250
Of the O'u (see further).

73
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,583
That's why we call it

74
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,083
Outsü,

75
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:56,750
because she is the one who sees, the one who watches, the one who sees for us

76
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,875
the one who sees through spirituality.

77
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,166
They are the ones who work so that they can give lives,

78
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,500
give more life to everything,

79
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,750
to the children, to the elderly, to everything, to everything, to everyone

80
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,666
that protects them against illness and against evil

81
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,666
spirit of the immune.

82
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,458
AHA.

83
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,416
So to start all this off, let's explain

84
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,291
colors. First the color red,

85
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:30,125
you see a red cloth here, so for you this is,

86
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:34,166
It is as if they saw a simple tablecloth.

87
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,583
But this has its symbol, why?

88
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:41,041
Because we have respect for all this, because this has its

89
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:44,291
magic, it has its spirit, red

90
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:48,708
It is what keeps everything in us Wayuu, it is what protects,

91
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,958
is the one who,

92
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,458
I mean that's the one that,

93
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,458
where we respect the color red more

94
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:00,458
because it symbolizes many things in the Wayuu culture,

95
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,833
because he is the one who keeps, he is the one who gives the dream,

96
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,541
It is the one that reveals dreams,

97
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:09,375
He is the one who has to do with everything, he is the one who takes care of us. One

98
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,041
take this

99
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:14,125
to be able to get something out of the mountain or get something out of a tree,

100
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:17,375
One wears a red patch or

101
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,000
a piece of red thread.

102
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
These are the oldest skein threads there,

103
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,375
I don't think they sell them anymore.

104
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,416
That,

105
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,541
If a piece is left on the mountain it is for power,

106
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:34,333
talk to the spirit of the plants, so one can

107
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:37,833
Grab part of those plants, why not grab it and that's it

108
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,833
You sit there to talk to them,

109
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:44,583
to ask, to give change, to say

110
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,750
Well, I come to ask you to give me this,

111
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,791
and I leave you this in exchange,

112
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,583
that's how we talk to him

113
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:56,416
And one wears his red cloth too or one dresses in red

114
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,625
to look for all this.

115
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,083
It's not that one is getting off to a bad start.

116
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:03,041
Because? because there are people who just go and start, not like that

117
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,041
further.

118
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,000
How is it?

119
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,166
they go blind,

120
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,958
They are left with other defects that one day they will leave it

121
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,958
Because? because their spirituality does not respect them.

122
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,958
Each one has their spirituality,

123
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,041
there is male and female

124
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:18,916
like us,

125
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:22,708
like us there are women and there are men, like this

126
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,250
the plants

127
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,375
There is also in that aspect.

128
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,375
That's why they each

129
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,000
one fulfills his function.

130
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,041
What is it for

131
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,833
each one already has its function, each one has its

132
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,250
function.

133
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,250
He fulfills his role.

134
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,208
And when are you going

135
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,208
well searching, harvesting,

136
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:53,125
does that also happen with a thread?

137
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,291
You leave him, you don't leave him just like that

138
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,500
because they don't have a hand,

139
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,166
one goes where the root is, one digs and buries

140
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,291
leave what has to be, it can be a necklace

141
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,750
because that necklace is because I'm not going to wear it again

142
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,333
this, this stays there forever

143
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:15,125
and he is also staying with one, because yes

144
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,958
There is one who says no, I am going to make the change another day,

145
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,666
I'm going to change with something else. No it can not be done.

146
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,083
Now what you gave him

147
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:22,958
I already said it. Already

148
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,625
what you started is already for you,

149
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,000
you are never going to return it,

150
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,708
That's how it is, that's why one has to respect it.

151
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,208
Is it always an exchange?

152
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,250
It's always an exchange one

153
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,083
one, because we humans to protect from them

154
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,250
we are present, because they are the ones who protect one.

155
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,583
Spirituality, what one respects,

156
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,666
the tradition of grandparents,

157
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:50,291
just as they left them, so we have to continue, so

158
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,291
we have to teach our children,

159
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,083
so they will also respect.

160
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,583
One has to teach them respect for the plant,

161
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:03,375
towards all this, just as we teach to respect

162
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:07,166
to other people, like this

163
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,083
we have to teach our children, our grandchildren,

164
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,958
to respect this.

165
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,416
What they have, because those are theirs,

166
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,416
because they are in their territory.

167
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,125
We don't get this from another territory, it's from here

168
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,833
Of the territory

169
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:25,166
Uriana, from here all this mountain range, this mountain range

170
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:28,041
It is full of everything, which is what it doesn't have,

171
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,375
He even has amulets.
Amulets?

172
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:31,958
Of course

173
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:32,375
that is

174
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,250
very reserved,

175
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,875
That is not here within this, that is separate.

176
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,500
That has

177
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,458
even more respect, because they can even

178
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,500
ask for expensive things,

179
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,291
They can ask for gold or they can ask for a beef to eat,

180
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,333
so that one can grasp

181
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,291
that.

182
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,291
Even more expensive than this.

183
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:54,500
By

184
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,875
that we respect that part and the grandparents know

185
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:04,416
What each thing is for is that and it teaches one and

186
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,000
One too

187
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,083
reserve it as they reserved it, then

188
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,083
we also reserve,

189
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,083
We keep it in there.

190
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,875
The most we know.

191
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,833
When one wants it is from one that a person crawls

192
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:20,791
I want, I want, it is done.

193
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,833
As?

194
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,750
How are you

195
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,666
It is already done.

196
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,083
This is done. It's dry.

197
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,791
This is already macerated, dry.

198
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:30,458
This is

199
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,166
macerated.

200
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:31,916
This is

201
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:34,125
another species of plant, but that cannot be

202
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:37,125
nor place in plain sight.

203
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,791
Because?

204
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,458
Because that is one

205
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,375
for the preservation of the baby in the mother's womb.

206
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:48,333
So that he doesn't get the evil eye, so that he doesn't get

207
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,166
pain in childbirth when going to

208
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,083
give birth to a person

209
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:55,291
What did they do when there was no doctor before?

210
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,916
It is with that, all

211
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:59,916
Those plants. And it was bought, it was changed

212
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:02,916
for a goat, for one of these things.

213
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,541
For a goat,

214
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:07,208
For a goat worth this

215
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:10,208
at that time. Because now no,

216
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:11,125
that now

217
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:15,708
If my baby goes through, that's a cesarean section, go to the hospital,

218
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,708
Not before, it's with that, that's it.

219
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,250
That's why the midwife is there, there are the

220
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,166
people best suited for that. Is the person that

221
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,291
will do the echogram

222
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:32,458
Wayuu, who see sex and everything.

223
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:36,583
Of course, that's why they are called Wayuu echograms because they fix that.

224
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,000
and they come and say right away, this one is female, this one

225
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,958
It is male,

226
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,958
so it's in the belly.

227
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,375
Let's get started.

228
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:52,166
This is a maraca,

229
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:55,166
Let's start and here we are with the reds.

230
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:58,125
Then the maraca,

231
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:01,041
This is the first who gives life, the one who saves

232
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,791
all.

233
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,625
Through Yüi (marijuana) which is

234
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:07,375
the tobacco leaf from here, from Macuira,

235
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,875
This is what they also call Macuira,

236
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,875
This is the Macuira.

237
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:13,000
Tobacco that

238
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,916
They are from here, because there are tobaccos that are very

239
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,666
different from this.

240
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:20,708
Instead of tobacco they write Macuira.

241
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,541
And does it come from here?

242
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:24,750
Is that why the name?

243
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,083
He was born here and are from here originally,

244
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:28,416
from here.

245
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:32,208
They are very typical from here,

246
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:33,083
it's tobacco

247
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:35,833
this.

248
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,041
and this one who, the

249
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:40,250
that calls the spirit of this, when one eats it

250
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:40,875
it already works

251
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:42,041
to cure everything.

252
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,375
And so they were all born

253
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:45,666
these.

254
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:47,541
In the middle

255
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:49,500
of that,

256
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,291
of that spiritualist who

257
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,583
exists in our

258
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:56,583
culture.

259
00:24:59,041 --> 00:24:59,708
AND

260
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,666
this is a species

261
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,916
of rattan,

262
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:06,958
that's here too,

263
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:09,958
This is also there in the Serranía de Perijá,

264
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,750
of this, there are things that are

265
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,750
far away and exists here with us.

266
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:16,708
As?

267
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:22,000
Because God put it, that's how it has to be, because that's what they are,

268
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,666
They are from a cold land and where there is a river and that

269
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:29,083
and here it occurs where there is no river.

270
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,125
This.

271
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:35,541
This serves to

272
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:38,166
When one makes a fracture, then one

273
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:39,500
part of the bone and that,

274
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,333
it scratches

275
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,333
with a stone, it is placed, it has its,

276
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,208
his diet, his diet is long,

277
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,958
there are things that should not be eaten,

278
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:56,958
the meats, the cheese most of all, the milk.

279
00:25:58,166 --> 00:25:59,750
This with this.

280
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,500
When you are taking that, you can't?

281
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,250
It can't be done,

282
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,500
has to be under confinement

283
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,541
with this because it works quickly

284
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:07,291
and

285
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:09,000
the bone is composed quickly

286
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,041
and returns to its normal state.

287
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:15,000
And that thing about the

288
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,041
the music there?

289
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:19,833
No,

290
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:23,166
Now that, now that, another different magic is coming and this

291
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:26,500
and those things that are already from here.

292
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And they are also powerful because,

293
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,166
Why does it have its magic and that,

294
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:35,416
and

295
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:38,958
with people who dream, that's what maceration does.

296
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:39,416
It's this one.

297
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,750
Here are some, some leaves of a plant

298
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,791
which is useful for the person who has menstrual cramps.

299
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:55,333
This serves those who suffer from it.

300
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,791
With this,

301
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:58,416
these are

302
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:02,958
leaves, they are from here too. This is when the person already

303
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:06,000
they are giving them cancer,

304
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,541
when she is already getting cancer in the womb,

305
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:09,666
when it comes

306
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:13,083
bleeding and it is frequent and with this you can

307
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,625
and it has a smell of,

308
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,500
Of,

309
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,500
from the rotten matrix.

310
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:27,125
Happens.
What is your name?

311
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:30,625
That's a kind of hawapi,

312
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:34,500
when the person can no longer

313
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,791
more and those days it is already rotting, to save it

314
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,250
he saves himself with that.

315
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,125
As? miracles are done

316
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:45,125
with that.

317
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:47,791
It is very miraculous.

318
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,833
This for us,

319
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:52,333
of an illness of us women.

320
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:54,375
When you get an infection there

321
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:56,541
in the matrix everything

322
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:58,333
fixes it.

323
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:01,041
And it is so important because before, as there was no

324
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:04,500
doctor, how did you get your womb removed?

325
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,583
nothing, there is no one, because people were dying,

326
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:10,583
You could and you would die, there was no more.

327
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:11,625
Not now.

328
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:12,500
And that the person

329
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,708
and this one is expensive, they sell it, they don't show it at all,

330
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:16,833
but,

331
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:19,750
They show him when he is like this,

332
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,083
but not in leaves like that, I am

333
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:24,875
I dare to do this now

334
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:26,375
with you.

335
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:28,083
Uh-huh, sure.

336
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,500
Everything has its change,

337
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,083
as I say.

338
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:34,083
This is the baby's bath,

339
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:37,083
when he is newborn he is the special one for them

340
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:39,500
naked

341
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,333
For baths and the Majayülü (lady in menarche) afterwards,

342
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:44,291
when you get off the hammock and the

343
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:47,083
confinement, this bathes him for a month,

344
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,250
He bathes with this.

345
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,083
And this is also taken so that you do not get sick,

346
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:56,416
Because the matrix also shrinks, too

347
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:59,916
this one and it is very common because this one is very well known

348
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:00,250
here,

349
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:01,666
No

350
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:04,666
They are like there are some that are not, you can hardly see them.

351
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,666
You have to walk.
Which one is that?

352
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:10,958
It is the naked Indian.

353
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:14,375
and this is the

354
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:17,375
the bija leaf

355
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:18,458
and that

356
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:21,416
women also take it

357
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:23,958
Confinement, at the time of his puberty.

358
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:24,958
This.

359
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:27,333
And also the newly born ones,

360
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,541
they take it.

361
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:32,208
And the child drinks and the newborn to clean

362
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:33,291
the

363
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:37,666
phlegm and in there what he fed with the

364
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:40,750
Mom, you have to clean it, it stays very clean.

365
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:51,083
And this is another kind of

366
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:54,125
Jawapi, they take this

367
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:57,958
women after childbirth.

368
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:59,583
This.

369
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:01,250
And it is very common of this too.

370
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:06,625
They are not from the mountains, from here in the region,

371
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:10,083
flat part.

372
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,833
How do you find them?

373
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:13,875
are you?

374
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:16,875
How do you find them in the mountains?

375
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:20,666
What is found in the mountains is different, like this one,

376
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:24,875
This is in the mountains, it doesn't exist here,

377
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:29,166
on the flat part, on the lower part, it is

378
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:33,541
It is the anamu.

379
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:36,500
And how do you know which is which when you're searching?

380
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,458
As

381
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:40,708
one knows it by the smell and everything by the leaf, everything

382
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,583
indigenous people know what it is, this is the anamú, which is good

383
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:47,625
carcinogenic

384
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:48,875
and to

385
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:51,208
the flu too

386
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:52,833
and a lot.

387
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:56,791
And this is another one too, the Guazuma, this is the Guazuma,

388
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:00,041
this is the one that,

389
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:02,291
this one works for everyone

390
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:05,291
viruses, as if to say

391
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:08,041
for whooping cough.

392
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:11,291
Everything that has to do with measles, smallpox

393
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:14,625
When you get old, then this is where

394
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,500
boiled,

395
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,250
It is taken in panela and also when diarrhea occurs.

396
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:26,541
acute that there is almost no cure, and people

397
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:29,541
now you can, now with this

398
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:32,541
for.

399
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:36,541
How is it done?

400
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:39,291
Is taken

401
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:41,208
It is not macerated, it is taken

402
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:46,375
And this is also another, another line of,

403
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:47,375
of

404
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:49,833
those bitter ones too

405
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:52,833
takes the Majayülü in their confinement too,

406
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:57,166
people who are sickly, who are skinny,

407
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:01,041
that she looks like an old lady, she takes it and turns back

408
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,333
plump and shiny.

409
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,833
With this.

410
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:08,833
But hey, it's good, isn't it?

411
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:11,791
smell it

412
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:14,250
you can take it

413
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:14,833
No.

414
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,875
Not for Neko who is there.

415
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:19,333
Something I know.

416
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:22,333
Put.

417
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:27,041
And yet it has.

418
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:28,625
AHA.

419
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:30,208
As you know.

420
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,291
Forks. For.

421
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:34,750
And this is the famous Wararat (Bejuco) that

422
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,250
It is the vine that is here, it is bitter and if this

423
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,208
HE

424
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:44,833
it takes a lot, here they are used quite a bit in the territory

425
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:47,958
and in other places they look for it, you buy it in pieces like that

426
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:50,250
They sell it where there is none.

427
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,250
On the other hand, here one has it like this.

428
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,583
Because

429
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:56,583
Of course because here we have it, we are rich in these.

430
00:32:57,916 --> 00:33:00,416
What is your name?

431
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:03,666
Wararat as a kind of vine, like a vine.

432
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:06,375
So they are the

433
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:09,583
and he has a lot of family about this,

434
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:12,875
They have a lot of family, different, different.

435
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:16,250
There are white and brown and there are this color.

436
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:19,083
And do they have a smell?

437
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:22,166
It has a smell and it has a taste and it has feet to

438
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,500
burping in people whose stomach is full

439
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,541
and they can't one day and not again,

440
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,041
with this it is cleaned and

441
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:33,125
that everything is bad for him and with this he gets better,

442
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:37,125
it is cleaned, it is purified.

443
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:45,083
And this is another species of jawapi,

444
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:49,250
This is what Majayülü takes in the running of the bulls.

445
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,791
This.

446
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:52,875
Can you explain

447
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:55,583
for someone who doesn't know, what is the running of the bulls?

448
00:33:56,041 --> 00:34:00,500
The confinement of what, of the Majayülü, or any confinement?

449
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:04,625
the one that represents the beginning for women, right?

450
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:09,083
Of course the Majayülü do their confinement, the mothers,

451
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,250
we mothers,

452
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,916
The grandmothers, we do the running of the bulls, for what purpose?

453
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,041
So that?

454
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:18,416
Because that girl is going to spend her life

455
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,583
to be a woman, she is no longer a girl, she is now a woman

456
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:27,416
and this woman has to value what she is too.

457
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:30,583
Before society she is no longer a girl, she is now a woman who

458
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:33,583
she's going to be, she's going to be a mother one day,

459
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:36,250
she's going to be a grandmother, she's not going to be anymore

460
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,375
the same toys from yesterday,

461
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:43,250
This is another role and those where women settle

462
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:47,000
and the girls to read, where one teaches them everything,

463
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:51,416
to knitting, to work, in the kitchen, in everything,

464
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:56,666
in everything, what her job is, what she is going to do one day

465
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:58,833
and what I eat

466
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:01,791
She is going to be seen before society.

467
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:04,250
She deserves your respect.

468
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,458
All that she can't be touching like before,

469
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:09,625
so she grabbed the other child and pushed him

470
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:13,125
because that will no longer be touching that child

471
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:14,500
nor to the other, nothing,

472
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,708
but she is going to do her job now

473
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:19,416
and it will be respected.

474
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:22,416
He who dares to grab her is because

475
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:26,125
They want to pay a goat for the performance.

476
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:30,541
Yes, that is a very big respect.

477
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:31,166
No

478
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:34,791
because he didn't give us that, no, not more for the touch, that

479
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:37,833
It can't be for him either,

480
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:40,958
must be respected.

481
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:43,916
and this plant

482
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:46,916
It is very good for phlegm,

483
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:48,708
Mashulü (cotton leaves)

484
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:49,375
Is

485
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:51,166
this good for phlegm,

486
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:54,916
when a child is born with phlegm and suffers from that and with this

487
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:55,333
it does,

488
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:57,708
are made of,

489
00:35:57,708 --> 00:36:01,041
It becomes a winter thing, it is baptized.

490
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:04,791
And this

491
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:07,833
It is another type of vine too.

492
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,666
This is for

493
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:13,291
a person who does not want to have more children,

494
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:16,125
let that be so,

495
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:18,541
This is…

496
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:20,041
Don't you want to have more children?

497
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:22,291
Whether

498
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:25,291
you want to sterilize, well, you take this,

499
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:28,000
A bun is made with this amount.

500
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,583
And this

501
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:33,041
is

502
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,666
the famous Kepisuta

503
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:35,041
this

504
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:38,625
It is the bath for babies and is also used for flu and

505
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:41,916
It's a good bath.

506
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:43,666
And this the Cortex of the

507
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:46,083
Carob tree,

508
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:47,375
which is very good too

509
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:50,416
to clean the blood

510
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,000
and when one,

511
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,750
when one sees that one

512
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,125
It gives him reluctance and everything, so with this

513
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:00,125
the blood is cleaned.

514
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:11,541
This one they call Bacchus's eye is called Chi'pira,

515
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:15,500
That's in the mountains, it's a kind of

516
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,416
bejuco

517
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:20,416
What purpose does that serve in our culture?

518
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:26,041
This helps so that when they are given to children, children,

519
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:30,458
Not the girls, let's go with the boys, with the men.

520
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,750
It is given to children when they later develop

521
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,958
Also, it is saved for a day and it is taken.

522
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,625
So that? For your health,

523
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:44,750
so that the rum does not become so tampered with

524
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,750
someday, when they go to take their chirinche.

525
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,916
It's not going to be rigged, but they measure their rum with it.

526
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,500
And this is also Soluou'ta, it is a kind of

527
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:59,291
very good for pain, for inflammation,

528
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:02,000
To reduce inflammation it can be

529
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,625
a blow, a bruise.

530
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:07,750
Or it could be, it could also be

531
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,583
When you get a toothache, you scratch it, it macerates.

532
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:13,666
with this already

533
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,750
goodbye pain.

534
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,750
San Diego Dentistry.

535
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,416
And that

536
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:23,416
It is also for a phlegm, this is also, they are

537
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:25,458
They are… What is it called?

538
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:28,291
They call it cloud, those live over there

539
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:31,458
in the mountains up there and it is called a cloud,

540
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:34,583
yes because he is the one who calls the clouds,

541
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:37,166
the cloud goes down in the mountains, because there is enough of that

542
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:38,583
Up there.

543
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:39,666
And this also works,

544
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:42,291
because the phlegm and illness of children

545
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:45,291
newly born.

546
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:49,083
Which one is missing?

547
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:51,000
Come on let's go with this one.

548
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,416
Well, that's what I said.

549
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,458
So this one is, this one is for,

550
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,083
for the person when they are pregnant,

551
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:02,250
so that there is no pain when she is going to give birth

552
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:05,375
he takes it when he already has his,

553
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:08,375
when he is nine months old, eight months already

554
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:09,833
to give birth,

555
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:13,041
that happens and maceration is also done

556
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,500
in a

557
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,500
chirinche and rub the belly so that the baby

558
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:20,958
don't be born with evil

559
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,291
eye and with other things.

560
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:25,583
And this is for the evil of

561
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:28,583
spirit.

562
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:29,500
This is for

563
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,500
the evil of spirit. When a person suffers from a bad spirit,

564
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:36,083
This is taken, grated and

565
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,541
take

566
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,666
And that evil spirit that is bothering you goes away,

567
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:43,833
may be cause of,

568
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:44,666
of,

569
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:49,416
other things that are not natural, can be false,

570
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:53,083
So it pushes him away.

571
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:56,375
And this is a seed that is a seed

572
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:59,375
that comes from other parts, they are from cold land

573
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:03,166
and here we also use it to cure diseases,

574
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:06,875
also of

575
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:08,291
for,

576
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:10,416
serves for

577
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:12,416
this serves to,

578
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:15,416
It's called Sekuanrü,

579
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:18,458
What is it for?

580
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,458
It serves to reduce inflammation.

581
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:30,041
That more than anything else.

582
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:32,041
Ah!

583
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:33,166
To wonder.

584
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:37,666
This is the wonder that serves as a bathroom,

585
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:40,166
to reduce the

586
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:43,166
fever

587
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:45,916
and to deworm

588
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:47,666
also.

589
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:50,916
Deworm more than in children the roots are used,

590
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:54,958
It is counted that only one is cooked so that

591
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:56,458
take.

592
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:58,625
And there is also another dewormer,

593
00:40:58,625 --> 00:40:59,833
It's also this one.

594
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:02,833
This seed that is from the great granite,

595
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:05,708
It is there,

596
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:07,041
The great granite.

597
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:10,041
With this

598
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:13,083
which when it is made has a brown color

599
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:14,541
and this here

600
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:15,791
this

601
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:18,708
it is macerated and taken,

602
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:20,750
for the parasite

603
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,500
and also the animals

604
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,000
They burn it and it gets into the donkey's anus

605
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,208
when there is also a cover,

606
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:29,750
that no longer shits,

607
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,458
so to make him shit it is like a suppository

608
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:35,166
for the animals.

609
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,208
AHA.

610
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:37,083
Good.

611
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:40,125
Do they also need?

612
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:41,958
and this is the famous tua tua,

613
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:45,208
This tua tua has,

614
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:49,583
has, vote liquid

615
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
and that liquid that is here is useful for sight.

616
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:54,916
When it gets dirty

617
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:57,916
in the eyes then they get,

618
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:58,875
he puts that on.

619
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:01,958
And it also serves to,

620
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:03,500
for

621
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,708
clean the blood and to lose weight

622
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:09,583
this.

623
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:13,083
A very fat person, with a lot of fat and a paunch

624
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:16,083
and take this and it is ready.

625
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:19,750
AHA.

626
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,000
And this,

627
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,875
the festival,

628
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:24,875
this is the festival

629
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,875
what we call the scorpion tail,

630
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:30,041
It's a vulgar name.

631
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:32,375
Aja Aja.

632
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:35,208
This is used for infection

633
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:37,708
in the throat

634
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:39,416
and internally too.

635
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:42,416
This.

636
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,375
This one too

637
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:02,375
It's called bija, they call it bija, white bija and

638
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,041
This spice is malua that we call,

639
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,333
These are typical from here too,

640
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:12,541
not like malambo, because malambo is from somewhere else.

641
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:15,708
On the other hand, this one here is very typical from here.

642
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,250
and this is for Buddhism,

643
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:22,875
that one can take it too and one can burn it too.

644
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:25,166
And with this it is also done

645
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:27,875
It has its rituality.

646
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:30,500
It is also to distance

647
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,250
To the evil spirits in the houses and it burns like yes

648
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:36,791
out,

649
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:39,791
that…

650
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:40,958
There are many ways

651
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:43,958
how to avoid diseases with this

652
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:48,375
and that's why children use handles and

653
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:50,125
to what end?

654
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:53,125
because they are going to keep away the diseases,

655
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:56,416
of flu from other things.

656
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,291
That's why

657
00:43:57,291 --> 00:43:59,500
we use it quite a bit.

658
00:44:08,666 --> 00:44:10,875
And then what is like anti COVID?

659
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:14,250
Which of those did they use during COVID?

660
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:16,583
This.

661
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:17,458
This is the one that

662
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:20,166
We call Wasim.

663
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:23,166
Anti-COVID and there is also,

664
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:24,500
Wararat

665
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,958
How did you know that this worked against COVID?

666
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:29,916
What is that process of knowing what plant

667
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:32,291
is it used for what things?

668
00:44:32,291 --> 00:44:33,500
And this too,

669
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:37,291
This almost subsides in almost half of the

670
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:38,666
mountain range, of these

671
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:41,125
They take it and sell it around, they take it to save

672
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:42,541
Uribia's brothers.

673
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:45,416
They looted them in the hills behind this.

674
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,875
This why

675
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:51,500
In reality, it is what saves many lives

676
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,250
and thank God we are here because we have it

677
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:56,791
here.

678
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:58,416
Here that pod

679
00:44:58,416 --> 00:45:01,416
It didn't arrive, it did arrive here, but we scared them away.

680
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,291
Well, it's just that what's here

681
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:12,291
Right now these are the few,

682
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:16,250
Because if I had everyone here, better said,

683
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:19,541
It would be all day.

684
00:45:21,833 --> 00:45:24,958
Those are the ones I'm showing you,

685
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:26,416
for now.

686
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:29,416
I already explained

687
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:31,666
colors.

688
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:33,250
And also,

689
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,250
can explain some of the yonna,

690
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:40,166
dance, dance, I don't know, are you one who teaches

691
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:40,416
right?

692
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:42,583
Oh yes I am one of the teachers

693
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:44,500
those who want to learn from.

694
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,791
AHA.

695
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:47,958
Uh-huh, sure.

696
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:48,666
And yes.

697
00:45:48,666 --> 00:45:51,666
So what does the yonna mean, when it is danced?

698
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,625
And for what?

699
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,416
What is it for?

700
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:59,000
that's what we call that

701
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,375
If this is the Outsü

702
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:04,375
"He gets drunk with this," Yonna asks.

703
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:07,875
And that is why there are the variants of the yonna.

704
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,500
What are the variants?

705
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,541
What they imitated from animals later,

706
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:15,083
because the common

707
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:15,791
is the step

708
00:46:15,791 --> 00:46:18,791
common that we call that are from our ancestors,

709
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,666
that they were the first that they learned

710
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:24,458
to do that

711
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:27,458
Epichikua, which is the one that,

712
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:30,083
which

713
00:46:30,083 --> 00:46:31,208
he begat the yonna

714
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:31,750
here

715
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:35,166
on earth, when in those times, in times

716
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:38,166
remote.

717
00:46:39,916 --> 00:46:41,833
And when one dances?

718
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:43,125
One?

719
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:47,333
One dances yonna when the Outsü orders

720
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:52,083
If there is going to be a yonna, when there is a sick person, he locks himself in,

721
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:55,208
It is saved and when the people leave,

722
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,958
the family has to be happy,

723
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:58,625
It has to make you want to dance,

724
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:00,791
because one is not going to have his yonna

725
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:03,333
Having a sick person doesn't make you want to do anything,

726
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:05,583
like you just want to cry,

727
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:07,833
but one is happy to see him

728
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:10,083
He has healed the child and the Majayülü

729
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:12,000
and when you lower it too

730
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,333
because it has to come out before society, before it

731
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,208
see enough,

732
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:19,750
the yonna is made, the feast is made,

733
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,750
You know that you have to get out, that you are going to get out.

734
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:40,041
There are many types of doing the yonna,

735
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,208
at housewarmings,

736
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:46,208
It is the marking of animals.

737
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:51,625
At the inauguration of the orchards, the graves

738
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:55,958
There is a lot, a lot, a lot.

739
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:58,541
When you inaugurate the water, when you do your

740
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:01,541
Wells, when already,

741
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:04,958
when, when Juya (old father)

742
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,083
He

743
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,166
He is angry with us and

744
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:10,666
he doesn't want to come, so you call him on the drum

745
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:14,458
As? eating roasted corn,

746
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:17,916
eating grit (Sa'wa) all that

747
00:48:17,916 --> 00:48:20,916
calling him there, appreciating that he comes,

748
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,875
that someone talks to him, someone tells him you don't see me as dirty, you

749
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:28,333
You don't see sweaty, one goes and dances and one has to wallow

750
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:31,333
the sand so that it can see that one is dirty, that one

751
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:32,375
you need it,

752
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:35,541
one is calling him, one like that with the spirit.

753
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:38,583
Of course, everything that has to do with

754
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:39,666
and that goes from house to house.

755
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,958
So at home one cannot say there is no food,

756
00:48:41,958 --> 00:48:44,583
because if one says, one goes wrong,

757
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:47,083
cannot say, one has to consume

758
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:48,791
whether it be beans or whatever,

759
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:52,166
not so much the meat but the beans that he loves and

760
00:48:52,916 --> 00:48:54,833
scrambled with toasted corn.

761
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:57,375
Yeah.

762
00:48:57,375 --> 00:49:00,041
Those traditions are no longer seen,

763
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:03,041
That is rather dying,

764
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:05,916
but you have to revive it, one

765
00:49:05,916 --> 00:49:08,958
you have to remember, one has to do that

766
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:11,375
so that

767
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:15,125
the little ones who were born after one see it

768
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:19,000
and they also have to familiarize themselves with that

769
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,458
And they have to feel

770
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,583
that are theirs, that are their culture,

771
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:25,833
that you don't have to feel sorry for him or be afraid of

772
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,458
exit on the Piyoi which is the Yonna track.

773
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:32,208
You have to lose your fear.

774
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:35,208
There are people who are afraid of traveling too.

775
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:38,958
Does painting also have to do with

776
00:49:39,416 --> 00:49:40,625
part of culture?

777
00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:43,583
Of course makeup is so important too.

778
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:46,958
because that's what goes with it, it's what accompanies

779
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,750
and the red scarf too

780
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:53,750
that accompanies the Yonna.

781
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:56,458
On the runway, makeup, accessories,

782
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:59,458
all that has to do with it.

783
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:00,041
And you

784
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:03,541
What is your relationship with nature or with plants

785
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:06,083
or with this place?

786
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:07,125
With Macuira?

787
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:10,125
Take care of them and respect them.

788
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:11,875
Ujum,

789
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:12,500
No no.

790
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,708
Don't take out so much just to have it there,

791
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:17,166
you know that when something is

792
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:20,166
so important that one is going to use it, it is not,

793
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:22,750
He's not going to take it out just to have it there,

794
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:25,750
but to use it for whatever is useful.

795
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,666
It's very curious,

796
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:31,666
like this time about medicinal plants.

797
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,333
Of course, since we have this opportunity here,

798
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:36,250
Now we don't start them just to start,

799
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:39,250
but because you have to see what

800
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:41,958
We are going to do with the plant, we do not throw it away without doing anything.

801
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:43,208
when you were little

802
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:46,666
how did you discover that you wanted to know more?

803
00:50:46,666 --> 00:50:47,666
Learn more about this?

804
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:52,500
I through my ancestors, through the elders,

805
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,791
the elderly, it can be a man or a woman, but one goes

806
00:50:56,791 --> 00:50:57,416
and one

807
00:50:57,416 --> 00:50:58,291
investigate, one

808
00:50:58,291 --> 00:51:01,250
He does his interview with them, what is it for,

809
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:03,500
at what point can one grab it,

810
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,500
Why? Why is it so important?

811
00:51:07,666 --> 00:51:08,750
what is your reason,

812
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,416
their actions towards us?

813
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:14,416
You ask all those questions with old people.

814
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:31,416
Not everyone can be Outsü

815
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:34,083
No.

816
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:37,708
Those are hereditary, those are hereditary

817
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:39,583
What if their grandparents had

818
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:41,041
anywhere it can be

819
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:42,458
mom's side or dad's side

820
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:45,458
If they liked one, I accept it.

821
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:46,875
And there are some who

822
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:49,458
I'm not afraid, I'm not going to accept it,

823
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:54,250
He is very strong and he puts in everything, no, he is good at it,

824
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:58,083
because as there are three types of

825
00:51:58,125 --> 00:52:01,125
those spiritualisms.

826
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:03,458
There is lalüi, there

827
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:07,375
He is the one who dreams and his dreams are true,

828
00:52:09,208 --> 00:52:12,041
when that gives its predictions

829
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:15,875
Well, things happen before they happen,

830
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:19,500
the things that are going to happen, they tell you in a dream,

831
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:23,333
just as it is going to happen, so it has to be,

832
00:52:24,416 --> 00:52:25,583
but wich ones?

833
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:26,916
Why do they dream?

834
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:29,333
Because to avoid,

835
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:32,291
to keep it away, to avoid it, to stop it from continuing,

836
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:37,125
so that he does not fall into such bad things, with bad temptations

837
00:52:37,708 --> 00:52:42,541
They warn you beforehand, the alüi is the one who sees the most in the dream.

838
00:52:43,291 --> 00:52:47,041
On the other hand, Outsü looks for the spirit,

839
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:51,500
read the ashes,

840
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:54,125
in the,

841
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:59,041
in firewood, a firewood is used

842
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,333
tender and burns.

843
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:08,333
So there it does connect with that,

844
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:13,041
with the ashes of what is happening, what is going to happen.

845
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:17,458
Yes it is an evil eye on a child, if it is for

846
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:18,958
inaugurate a house,

847
00:53:18,958 --> 00:53:21,958
Yes, the devil is there, if he lives there, we must stay away,

848
00:53:22,208 --> 00:53:25,791
You have to not put him in his way, you have to keep him away from there,

849
00:53:26,291 --> 00:53:29,500
ask them for the land, the site.

850
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,833
In exchange for?

851
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:34,333
Then one asks for the change,

852
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:36,458
If they say in the change,

853
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:37,000
that I want

854
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,083
a black goat, no, I want a red goat

855
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,416
and that red goat

856
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:45,083
how it should be eaten, like this, if it is in soup, if it is stewed,

857
00:53:45,208 --> 00:53:49,708
That's what their tobacco says, which I didn't use before.

858
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:52,833
The one who uses tobacco is the piachi (Oulaküt)

859
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:56,208
The Piache is the one who uses tobacco and

860
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,541
chirinche

861
00:53:58,541 --> 00:54:00,625
And sometimes they are not so correct

862
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:03,625
The Piaches are already people who

863
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:07,375
works with the devil and who works with the good spirit

864
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:10,416
with the evil spirit and so on.

865
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:11,500
That's why they call him

866
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,958
witches

867
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:16,208
Because they do good things and

868
00:54:16,208 --> 00:54:18,708
bad things, and the negative part

869
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:21,333
and the positive part does good things.

870
00:54:21,333 --> 00:54:25,875
On the other hand, Outsü does the right thing, does its

871
00:54:25,875 --> 00:54:26,458
job.

872
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:30,041
He hides nothing what

873
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:33,500
He says, whether he wants to or not, but I'm going to tell him,

874
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:39,583
Tell me if you have, if you have a patient there

875
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:42,916
there he is going to die, he says no, I think I can't anymore

876
00:54:42,916 --> 00:54:45,750
But with this one, this one is going to die.

877
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:49,625
Why am I going to insist so much if this no longer exists?

878
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:53,083
He already left for Jeepira and I can't get the oxen anymore,

879
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:56,375
He's no longer on the road, I didn't reach him, he's already gone.

880
00:54:57,250 --> 00:55:00,250
That is why family members have to be satisfied,

881
00:55:00,458 --> 00:55:03,458
What are you going to do if Outsü already told the truth.

882
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:06,625
On the other hand, the other too, which is the alüi,

883
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:09,291
then that is the one who works only with dreams

884
00:55:09,291 --> 00:55:12,291
and work with plants and work with other things

885
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:14,000
and they are also true.

886
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,583
In all their things, they are strict in their things.

887
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:20,791
Well, that's what we talked about,

888
00:55:20,791 --> 00:55:22,875
They are different.

889
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:24,916
And now comes a spiritualism

890
00:55:24,916 --> 00:55:27,875
now with the Piache that is beginning to

891
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:28,833
sleep

892
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:31,291
deep and then the voice changes

893
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:34,791
and to say that I don't know, it means that no, that I don't

894
00:55:34,791 --> 00:55:38,208
wronged, that they did you wrong, that

895
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:41,083
There is a funeral there in your house,

896
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:44,083
You don't have to take him out for so many.

897
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:46,250
They say now.

898
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,333
That you have a doll there,

899
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:52,083
that I'm going to get it for so many, that if they give me that much yes

900
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:55,458
and if they give me necklaces and they give me goats and they give me cows and they give me

901
00:55:55,916 --> 00:55:58,625
my amount of money, well

902
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:00,166
That's pure business.

903
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:03,916
Now, that Outsü no longer exists and the Alüi no longer exists.

904
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:07,958
There are some, but they are isolated in the community and in the family,

905
00:56:08,291 --> 00:56:09,625
in some. There is

906
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:12,958
some who still believe that, there are others who don't, they

907
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:16,458
They say I'm not going to send him out and

908
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:19,125
they tie her hair

909
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:22,208
on the other Outsü

910
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:25,291
which is the most practical to what they are there

911
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,500
that since they are new,

912
00:56:29,791 --> 00:56:32,791
can be removed.

913
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:34,500
There are some that do

914
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,791
They say that, if I want, well they settle it and

915
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:38,416
it

916
00:56:38,416 --> 00:56:41,041
They do with their teacher and learn and do

917
00:56:41,041 --> 00:56:43,041
things,

918
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:45,125
the Outsü

919
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:47,291
It's the one that, the one that

920
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:49,666
first he knew all the

921
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:52,541
floors

922
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:54,166
through their spirits

923
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:57,458
and every day new ones explode

924
00:56:57,458 --> 00:57:00,458
things.

925
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,416
Throughout,

926
00:57:02,416 --> 00:57:05,125
the same in the light and also with your dream explodes

927
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:07,041
new things and meet new

928
00:57:07,041 --> 00:57:10,500
no, the grandparents, the family doesn't know him

929
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:13,541
and suddenly he knows them, why?

930
00:57:13,541 --> 00:57:16,125
Because they send him to look for him where he is,

931
00:57:16,125 --> 00:57:17,500
there it is and it's useful for this

932
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:17,875
and that,

933
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:20,875
I have given him his explanation as it is, how he has to work.

934
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:24,791
Very good.

935
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:27,166
Well.

936
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:30,166
That is the origin of all this.

937
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:37,000
Well, we've talked about magic and that, what?

938
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,875
is magic for you or more like spirituality?

939
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:44,708
Not the magic is the spirits, the Aseyuu

940
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:47,833
what we call the spirit,

941
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:51,958
that one does not see, but one feels it, one asks for it,

942
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:52,750
They warn you

943
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:52,833
to

944
00:57:52,833 --> 00:57:57,333
one, is the one who gives one the power, everything, are things

945
00:57:57,333 --> 00:58:01,083
powerful, it is a powerful spirit that one

946
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:04,083
He doesn't know if he is there, if he is here, if he is with us,

947
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:07,875
That is with us at the moment, because this is here,

948
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:11,458
That is in us, but we do not feel it,

949
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:14,833
We don't see it, but we do feel it because

950
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:17,250
I'm sorry.

951
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:20,291
I don't know if you feel it.

952
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:22,500
The question also to

953
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,250
you

954
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:26,291
is

955
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:29,291
many say that the

956
00:58:29,666 --> 00:58:32,250
the ancestors of one they already lost

957
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,291
life, right,

958
00:58:33,291 --> 00:58:36,291
they connect with the Outsü

959
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:39,000
to help her with certain things,

960
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
how to avoid

961
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:43,791
accidents and things like that.

962
00:58:43,791 --> 00:58:44,750
They tell them, I dreamed about my grandmother she told me

963
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:48,583
to bathe my daughter

964
00:58:50,083 --> 00:58:54,416
That is that spirit is when it uses the body

965
00:58:54,416 --> 00:58:57,750
of the person who believes in magic,

966
00:58:57,791 --> 00:59:00,750
who has that ritual, who believes in their belief

967
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:05,416
live with her, that's why she sends you to that person,

968
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,625
because he doesn't tell everyone, I wish it were

969
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:12,833
So, I told him everything, his everything, we would all know everything,

970
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:15,875
we would all be wise,

971
00:59:15,875 --> 00:59:18,458
because that has to be a chosen person

972
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:21,625
for that person to whom you want to talk, to whom you want to tell

973
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:22,458
his things,

974
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:25,083
to those who want to prevent things that cannot happen.

975
00:59:26,791 --> 00:59:29,791
That's what happens.

976
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:31,416
And also it

977
00:59:31,416 --> 00:59:34,416
older ones, those that no longer exist

978
00:59:34,541 --> 00:59:37,708
You also feel the purest smell at night.

979
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,083
Who are these people?

980
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:43,083
The old people who lived in that territory,

981
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:46,333
the old people who are underground and buried.

982
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:51,083
They walk by the spirit, but one does not see,

983
00:59:51,375 --> 00:59:53,625
We then Wayuu believe so much,

984
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:55,791
so we feel that smell at night.

985
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:57,208
You have to set up the coffee,

986
00:59:57,208 --> 00:59:59,958
We have to make coffee, grandpa has arrived, grandma has arrived

987
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:02,958
to toast, poor thing, comes to visit us.

988
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,916
Well, since they lived here, that was theirs,

989
01:00:05,916 --> 01:00:07,875
here they had their roses, here they had

990
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:08,416
his bower,

991
01:00:08,416 --> 01:00:09,666
here they had their little house,

992
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:12,708
They had good traces of her here.

993
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:15,750
It's around here that they urinated like this.

994
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:17,500
One believes that.

995
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,250
That's why they come to visit him.

996
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:22,250
She doesn't come to do harm, she comes to visit,

997
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,541
but from time to time he doesn't come here every time.

998
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:28,500
There are some who are also quick-tempered.

999
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,666
That also starts to scream at him

1000
01:00:30,666 --> 01:00:33,666
well, get out of here, you're not going to be there,

1001
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,416
there with your bad smell here, because you have to

1002
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:39,333
shake your ugly panties

1003
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:41,666
here, shake it further, he tells him

1004
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:44,000
and makes the maraca

1005
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,750
So

1006
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,041
nothing else

1007
01:00:48,041 --> 01:00:50,791
and immediately the smell disappears,

1008
01:00:50,791 --> 01:00:53,291
because that is a belief.

1009
01:00:53,291 --> 01:00:53,500
That

1010
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,916
still lives, still exists

1011
01:00:55,916 --> 01:00:58,916
here with us.

1012
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:04,500
We already mentioned

1013
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:08,458
right now the Outsü can see the traces

1014
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:11,833
of the souls that have already left for Jeepira, you could speak

1015
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:14,750
What happens to the soul according to culture

1016
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:16,416
of us?

1017
01:01:16,416 --> 01:01:18,958
well it is said that they are going to Jeepira and all that.

1018
01:01:18,958 --> 01:01:20,666
Could you talk about that?

1019
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:22,458
Of course, Jeepira

1020
01:01:22,458 --> 01:01:24,125
It's a place, it's a place,

1021
01:01:24,125 --> 01:01:25,041
They say it is

1022
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:29,000
a kind of ravine that we don't know if it is in the sky,

1023
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,916
yes it is here on earth,

1024
01:01:30,916 --> 01:01:33,125
but it is between us.

1025
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:36,125
That's not something from another world.

1026
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:38,583
It can be in the sea or

1027
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:41,583
It can be here on earth.

1028
01:01:41,916 --> 01:01:43,666
That is a belief, because

1029
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:47,166
That exists, but

1030
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:49,958
but there are others, but like us sometimes

1031
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:53,166
The literature of the Bible says that heaven is over there,

1032
01:01:54,166 --> 01:01:55,375
that when we die

1033
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:58,000
over there, one is no longer left with that literature

1034
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,958
and that's what the ancestors say, they say that Jeepira

1035
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:04,375
is here with us, is it in the sea or is it

1036
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:07,375
here with the earth

1037
01:02:07,541 --> 01:02:08,416
where we start,

1038
01:02:08,416 --> 01:02:12,291
We do not leave, but we lay down our bones,

1039
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:14,125
the bones are lying,

1040
01:02:14,125 --> 01:02:16,708
but the soul continues to live with people,

1041
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:18,541
the old people say.

1042
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:22,125
Where? Yes when they are tired of being here, they

1043
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:25,750
Now the land for them is the sea, they are in the sea.

1044
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:29,875
Is that also related

1045
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:33,125
why they have two wakes, can you explain that?

1046
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,958
So.

1047
01:02:34,958 --> 01:02:37,000
Which wake?

1048
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,708
The exhumation?

1049
01:02:38,708 --> 01:02:41,458
Of course, the exhumation is another wake.

1050
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:42,875
It is already

1051
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:45,875
when people come back again,

1052
01:02:46,208 --> 01:02:47,458
they come back

1053
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:50,958
At the moment when the body is exhumed they return.

1054
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:55,375
Now if they can go again, they won't come back again.

1055
01:02:55,916 --> 01:02:58,916
I say that they return to look at their remains,

1056
01:02:58,916 --> 01:03:00,333
to look at people.

1057
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:02,125
That's why the exhumers

1058
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:05,125
one tells them when it is a woman and takes

1059
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:08,041
rest of a man, one tells him,

1060
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:10,000
They greet him after his exhumation

1061
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,416
already washed and everything clean.

1062
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:13,333
He says oh my grandfather arrived.

1063
01:03:13,333 --> 01:03:16,250
Grandpa tells her, she could be a woman,

1064
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:19,125
the one he is exhuming, but because she already lives with him

1065
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:22,750
and his spirit, his soul lives with him and is in his heart.

1066
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:26,750
One tells him “grandpa has arrived, how is grandpa?”

1067
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:27,541
everyone says,

1068
01:03:29,041 --> 01:03:32,125
because, because she just exhumed the rest of her

1069
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:33,625
grandfather.

1070
01:03:33,625 --> 01:03:36,375
When she is one, when she is also a woman,

1071
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:38,916
and the man is,

1072
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:40,125
the one who exhumes is a man,

1073
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:43,625
then one also says to her “oh grandma”,

1074
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:44,041
And says

1075
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:45,041
then he like

1076
01:03:45,041 --> 01:03:47,875
just think about your current situation

1077
01:03:47,875 --> 01:03:50,875
He says “not at all, be serious” (said)

1078
01:03:51,458 --> 01:03:51,875
I don't

1079
01:03:51,875 --> 01:03:52,791
like that they

1080
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:56,208
say like that, because of course, because you think about nothing more,

1081
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,500
He does not think about the spirit he is exhuming.

1082
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:02,958
That's what it is.

1083
01:04:02,958 --> 01:04:05,250
and let's say the sugar curtain

1084
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:08,250
is a place where they also go

1085
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:11,500
when people die or not?

1086
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:16,250
No, they call it the end of the candle, not those are literatures that...

1087
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,500
but if the Jeepirachi,

1088
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:23,625
Jeepirachi is the name of a hill that is inside the sea.

1089
01:04:24,208 --> 01:04:24,666
Aha.

1090
01:04:24,666 --> 01:04:29,416
So that's the place, because I looked into that too.

1091
01:04:30,375 --> 01:04:32,125
What's up with that?

1092
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:34,083
There are some gentlemen, there were, they lived

1093
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:35,208
but they no longer exist,

1094
01:04:35,208 --> 01:04:37,791
gentlemen who lived close to him,

1095
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,791
They moved over time later,

1096
01:04:39,791 --> 01:04:41,375
because I couldn't take it anymore

1097
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:44,375
with the moo of the cow the meow of the sheep,

1098
01:04:44,375 --> 01:04:48,625
the barking of the dog, the braying of the donkey and all that

1099
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:50,000
what it feels,

1100
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,291
the child's cry, the old woman's cry, the stove and so on.

1101
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:57,708
And there are things, even the drum feels there

1102
01:04:58,666 --> 01:05:00,375
on that hill,

1103
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:02,625
inside that sea.

1104
01:05:02,625 --> 01:05:04,125
So they,

1105
01:05:04,125 --> 01:05:07,083
once they were how many, many goats

1106
01:05:07,083 --> 01:05:08,375
has its people

1107
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:11,500
and in the day there is nothing, but at night it is the thing,

1108
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:16,416
starting at 11 pm, they feel that way there. So what

1109
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,333
They moved away,

1110
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:24,250
because because the old man was looking he saw logs, he lit

1111
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:25,666
he saw everything.

1112
01:05:25,666 --> 01:05:28,541
There were voices and all that.

1113
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:31,541
And he fell asleep alone.

1114
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:34,875
So what are you doing spying on us?

1115
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:37,083
If you still want to live here,

1116
01:05:37,083 --> 01:05:40,083
Either you come here or you stay there still!

1117
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:43,208
you move, go where

1118
01:05:43,208 --> 01:05:46,208
They told him, vacate this.

1119
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:48,000
They have to leave their houses,

1120
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,416
They just leave with their clothes and everything.

1121
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:52,458
He left everything, how did they live? like this,

1122
01:05:52,625 --> 01:05:55,541
They lived like this, clearing the mountain

1123
01:05:55,541 --> 01:05:59,583
and they put some tents there and over time they built

1124
01:05:59,666 --> 01:06:01,250
He built his yotojoro (woody trunk of the cardon)

1125
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:03,375
This is how the old people who lived told

1126
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:04,375
about him

1127
01:06:04,375 --> 01:06:07,208
Jeepirachi, and

1128
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:10,083
what they call ship and what they call I don't know what

1129
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:11,916
and there they disappear

1130
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:14,333
they. That

1131
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:17,208
They are distant, they are ships

1132
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:20,541
who come from afar, travelers on their cruise and

1133
01:06:20,541 --> 01:06:23,083
They all disappear,

1134
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:23,625
the salt

1135
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:26,208
sinks it

1136
01:06:26,208 --> 01:06:27,000
there near the

1137
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,291
hill.

1138
01:06:41,625 --> 01:06:43,125
Well,

1139
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:46,083
we do it to introduce you again,

1140
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:49,083
just to make sure that we have

1141
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:51,208
who are you and what do you do?

1142
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:54,208
and where are you?

1143
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:55,541
Who I am?

1144
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:56,541
I am Romelia

1145
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:59,083
Montiel

1146
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:00,416
Oriana,

1147
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:04,458
I am the ancestral knower of the Kayushipana community

1148
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,375
AHA.

1149
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:08,791
I am an artisan,

1150
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:10,416
I am a teacher in all of them.

1151
01:07:10,416 --> 01:07:14,083
In crafts, in yonna, in recreations

1152
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:15,041
and everything that has to do with it

1153
01:07:15,041 --> 01:07:17,291
with children and adults too,

1154
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:18,375
Why not?

1155
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:20,500
the one who wants to learn new things,

1156
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:24,666
wants to learn to do things, he wants to exploit his

1157
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:27,250
your mind

1158
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:27,833
with regard

1159
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:30,458
to culture.

1160
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:34,000
And we are in the Uriana territory here in Uliana which is in Kayushipana

1161
01:07:36,916 --> 01:07:37,375
I

1162
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:40,375
I am also a traditional doctor in this, me too

1163
01:07:40,416 --> 01:07:42,416
I do my ritual with the Majayülü

1164
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:59,791
I wanted to know the importance

1165
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:04,625
to pass knowledge to new generation to children

1166
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:09,541
and I don't know how important that is to you.

1167
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:10,166
and for…

1168
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:11,708
Sure, it's so important.

1169
01:08:11,708 --> 01:08:13,333
I want someone like you

1170
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:15,958
who knows more than us too, who

1171
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,583
make a book,

1172
01:08:17,583 --> 01:08:19,416
It is a project towards all that,

1173
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:21,208
to medicinal plants and everything,

1174
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:23,416
and we help them and they get to have anything,

1175
01:08:23,416 --> 01:08:25,000
Any worry.

1176
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,916
We help again with anything you want to know

1177
01:08:27,916 --> 01:08:29,791
if everything is

1178
01:08:29,791 --> 01:08:33,833
to deepen and unite more of the knowledge.

1179
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:35,958
and for the children?

1180
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:37,083
For children too

1181
01:08:37,083 --> 01:08:38,000
And it is possible

1182
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:38,875
any project

1183
01:08:38,875 --> 01:08:41,291
what can be done with children also the yonna in which

1184
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,375
we are part of that

1185
01:08:43,375 --> 01:08:45,291
Also, what happens is that we

1186
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:46,791
because we lack resources

1187
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:49,125
That's why we don't have the clothing for that,

1188
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:52,333
because there's a siding over here and all that

1189
01:08:53,291 --> 01:08:55,625
What does it have to do with culture?

1190
01:08:55,625 --> 01:08:58,833
but we are low on resources, we don't have enough for that, that's why

1191
01:08:58,833 --> 01:09:02,791
We are left, but with three pieces of cloth we have we teach.

1192
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:07,708
Because it is an interest.

1193
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:08,875
AND.

1194
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:10,458
A diversion.

1195
01:09:10,458 --> 01:09:12,875
Another question we want to ask.

1196
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:14,041
It's it's.

1197
01:09:14,041 --> 01:09:16,625
My experience and when.

1198
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:17,625
That.

1199
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:20,166
Yes, everything is done.

1200
01:09:20,166 --> 01:09:23,166
And I would like to know how knowledge

1201
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:26,583
that you have shared with us, you share here,

1202
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:27,708
if you yourself

1203
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:31,750
You say that not everyone is chosen to know this,

1204
01:09:31,916 --> 01:09:34,916
then because you feel that at the same time,

1205
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:36,625
If you don't allow it,

1206
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:37,291
I would record more

1207
01:09:37,291 --> 01:09:39,625
and not everyone should be like it for it to work,

1208
01:09:39,625 --> 01:09:40,833
but someone is chosen

1209
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:43,750
as

1210
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:45,541
we are chosen.

1211
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:48,541
Yes sir, of course,

1212
01:09:49,333 --> 01:09:52,041
chosen like some with clear, why not,

1213
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:54,916
I know that you are not going to go for this sheet and where I am

1214
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:57,916
I'm going to look for you or you're not going to invest as much,

1215
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:00,208
because instead.

1216
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:03,208
Is

1217
01:10:04,541 --> 01:10:06,916
more or less that, because not anymore.

1218
01:10:06,916 --> 01:10:08,125
Everything says.

1219
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:10,125
But let's say

1220
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:12,375
that we are recording, well the idea is that

1221
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:15,333
many people see it and it's like that's good

1222
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:18,625
to preserve nature or how it would be.

1223
01:10:18,625 --> 01:10:20,041
Of course, of course,

1224
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:20,375
clear,

1225
01:10:20,375 --> 01:10:23,625
that's good for preserving nature and all that.

1226
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:26,625
Well, let them also respect that they have still

1227
01:10:26,791 --> 01:10:29,750
tradition still lives with us,

1228
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:34,125
because we are not all, not only

1229
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:37,125
in theory but in the practical part.

1230
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:40,416
We still keep it

1231
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:41,208
because we are

1232
01:10:41,208 --> 01:10:43,750
still the root of all heart and spirit.

1233
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:44,333
With them

1234
01:10:45,958 --> 01:10:47,166
we are dedicated to.

1235
01:10:47,166 --> 01:10:49,291
These.

1236
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:52,333
Seek encouraging wisdom.

1237
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:55,208
There is a dream,

1238
01:10:55,208 --> 01:10:58,583
They tell me that they are going to do it, they are going to work and that

1239
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:01,208
It will be clear.

1240
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:03,958
We are, we are leaders before.

1241
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:06,958
The lo.

1242
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,208
What is traditional medicine?

1243
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:12,208
House of God, what he wants,

1244
01:11:12,291 --> 01:11:15,291
because what you have not understood here

1245
01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:17,375
in the person

1246
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:20,375
that is going to be another for them,

1247
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:23,416
they they they are chosen.

1248
01:11:23,416 --> 01:11:24,458
Clear.

1249
01:11:24,458 --> 01:11:27,791
Through dreams they say and if they accept, then they

1250
01:11:27,791 --> 01:11:30,750
They continue, of course, in that process.

1251
01:11:30,833 --> 01:11:33,541
But if you reject what you want, soon a piece of paper.

1252
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:34,125
I don't know which ones

1253
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:37,333
are written and thus reject the proposal of and.

1254
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:40,291
It remains or remains like this again,

1255
01:11:40,708 --> 01:11:44,166
Thus, without anything, nothing comes for that.

1256
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:46,083
No, it doesn't start for me.

1257
01:11:46,083 --> 01:11:48,208
I have always been me, mine in my grandmother

1258
01:11:48,208 --> 01:11:49,041
and something and I like

1259
01:11:49,041 --> 01:11:52,166
She says that she is my dream with true, with.

1260
01:11:52,166 --> 01:11:54,500
Hers. And especially with dreams.

1261
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,625
But there are also out there

1262
01:11:57,625 --> 01:12:00,583
my grandmother's footprint.

1263
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:03,708
With her dreams.

1264
01:12:03,708 --> 01:12:06,125
The grandmother I mentioned was very pretty.

1265
01:12:06,125 --> 01:12:08,916
She died when she was 100 or so years old.

1266
01:12:08,916 --> 01:12:10,166
From that, she did not suffer from.

1267
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:13,416
Illness and we have enough of their grandchildren

1268
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:16,708
We know enough that they are, so we are following

1269
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:19,708
her steps.

1270
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,500
She is from a whole family of 100 years to

1271
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:27,500
all.

1272
01:12:28,666 --> 01:12:30,541
