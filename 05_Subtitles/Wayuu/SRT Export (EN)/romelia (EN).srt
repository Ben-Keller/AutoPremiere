1
00:04:24:08 --> 00:04:25:08
What does that mean?

2
00:04:25:08 --> 00:04:28:08
symbols that are being put?

3
00:04:29:11 --> 00:04:32:11
ah, what I'm going to place here.

4
00:04:32:14 --> 00:04:35:14
It is the symbol of the sun

5
00:05:30:05 --> 00:05:33:05
here

6
00:05:53:23 --> 00:05:56:23
and

7
00:06:40:14 --> 00:06:40:23
this.

8
00:06:57:03 --> 00:07:00:03
Is

9
00:08:27:16 --> 00:08:29:04
the same.

10
00:08:29:04 --> 00:08:32:04
AND

11
00:08:32:17 --> 00:08:33:11
these.

12
00:08:33:11 --> 00:08:36:23
These paintings are going to be for parties only.

13
00:08:37:12 --> 00:08:40:12
and they are like, they are the fine ones

14
00:08:40:13 --> 00:08:41:18
because there are others too, kind of…

15
00:08:41:18 --> 00:08:46:07
as for daily and this is it,

16
00:08:47:09 --> 00:08:47:19
which is a

17
00:08:47:19 --> 00:08:50:19
kind of canned powder.

18
00:08:52:08 --> 00:08:55:08
Is this.

19
00:08:55:12 --> 00:08:57:11
And where does the dust come from?

20
00:08:57:11 --> 00:09:01:05
It is from female tree fungus species

21
00:09:01:05 --> 00:09:05:21
that they produce from the mountains and that occurs when it is already winter.

22
00:09:06:00 --> 00:09:09:00
By

23
00:09:09:13 --> 00:09:12:13
when it is cold, that produces the cold

24
00:09:12:21 --> 00:09:15:08
species of mushrooms. It has its time

25
00:09:15:08 --> 00:09:18:08
in winter, that happens in November.

26
00:14:25:10 --> 00:14:26:04
So

27
00:14:26:04 --> 00:14:30:07
can you introduce yourself, who are you, what do you really do?

28
00:14:49:01 --> 00:14:50:01
I introduce myself,

29
00:14:50:01 --> 00:14:52:08
my name is Romelia Montiel,

30
00:14:52:08 --> 00:14:55:19
I am the one who knows the Kayushipana community here in Alta

31
00:14:55:19 --> 00:14:58:19
Guajira Nazareth

32
00:14:59:15 --> 00:15:01:21
I belong to the Uriana clan,

33
00:15:01:21 --> 00:15:03:10
I am from, my origin

34
00:15:03:10 --> 00:15:05:13
It's there on the hill that's back there.

35
00:15:05:13 --> 00:15:08:13
Sekuolu (name of the hill)

36
00:15:08:14 --> 00:15:11:16
So I'm going to talk about medicinal plants,

37
00:15:12:19 --> 00:15:16:13
to a few species of plants that are here, uff

38
00:15:16:15 --> 00:15:17:16
there is still more

39
00:15:17:16 --> 00:15:18:15
that is, still

40
00:15:18:15 --> 00:15:21:10
There is after this and there is still more.

41
00:15:21:10 --> 00:15:24:16
The one who keeps it, Macuira, is our grandmother.

42
00:15:24:17 --> 00:15:28:14
It's where they were all born, it's where they spawned

43
00:15:28:14 --> 00:15:31:00
God to us so that this plant

44
00:15:31:00 --> 00:15:34:10
will stay here with us, because all this

45
00:15:34:10 --> 00:15:37:10
They were humans before us.

46
00:15:37:12 --> 00:15:40:12
That's why it has its magic, it has its spirit.

47
00:15:40:21 --> 00:15:44:11
We respect them, we respect them a lot

48
00:15:44:11 --> 00:15:47:19
that we still preserve the ancestral tradition.

49
00:15:50:03 --> 00:15:51:07
As,

50
00:15:51:07 --> 00:15:51:17
as already

51
00:15:51:17 --> 00:15:52:23
I have done a lot of research,

52
00:15:52:23 --> 00:15:56:08
my research is so deep for many years

53
00:15:56:08 --> 00:15:59:08
It is behind everything, not only in the medicinal plant

54
00:16:00:01 --> 00:16:03:01
but in everything that has to do with our culture

55
00:16:04:00 --> 00:16:05:04
ancestral.

56
00:16:05:04 --> 00:16:08:04
How have you investigated? What is the method?

57
00:16:08:04 --> 00:16:11:03
I have investigated with the old men of Macuira

58
00:16:11:14 --> 00:16:13:12
that there are a few

59
00:16:13:12 --> 00:16:16:12
that no longer exist here on earth, they are with daddy God

60
00:16:17:12 --> 00:16:20:05
and those who are left after them

61
00:16:20:05 --> 00:16:22:07
They are the grandchildren, the grandparents.

62
00:16:22:07 --> 00:16:23:14
That's why I keep them.

63
00:16:23:14 --> 00:16:25:23
My grandmothers are also people who are

64
00:16:25:23 --> 00:16:27:04
They like all this,

65
00:16:27:04 --> 00:16:30:04
They are people who have spirit too.

66
00:16:30:06 --> 00:16:31:00
Are

67
00:16:31:00 --> 00:16:35:04
shamans, they are spiritualists and all that, they are like us

68
00:16:35:04 --> 00:16:36:08
we call it Outsü.

69
00:16:36:08 --> 00:16:39:01
We the Wayuu indigenous people, Outsü.

70
00:16:39:01 --> 00:16:41:17
because it's called Outsü, because that one comes

71
00:16:41:17 --> 00:16:44:07
of vision, of vision.

72
00:16:45:06 --> 00:16:48:06
Of the O'u (see further).

73
00:16:48:18 --> 00:16:50:14
That's why we call it

74
00:16:50:14 --> 00:16:51:02
Outsü,

75
00:16:51:02 --> 00:16:55:18
because she is the one who sees, the one who watches, the one who sees for us

76
00:16:55:21 --> 00:16:58:21
the one who sees through spirituality.

77
00:16:59:00 --> 00:17:04:04
They are the ones who work so that they can give lives,

78
00:17:04:04 --> 00:17:06:12
give more life to everything,

79
00:17:06:12 --> 00:17:09:18
to the children, to the elderly, to everything, to everything, to everyone

80
00:17:10:18 --> 00:17:14:16
that protects them against illness and against evil

81
00:17:14:16 --> 00:17:17:16
spirit of the immune.

82
00:17:17:17 --> 00:17:19:11
AHA.

83
00:17:19:11 --> 00:17:22:09
So to start all this off, let's explain

84
00:17:22:09 --> 00:17:25:06
colors. First the color red,

85
00:17:25:06 --> 00:17:29:02
you see a red cloth here, so for you this is,

86
00:17:29:08 --> 00:17:33:03
It is as if they saw a simple tablecloth.

87
00:17:33:15 --> 00:17:36:13
But this has its symbol, why?

88
00:17:36:13 --> 00:17:40:00
Because we have respect for all this, because this has its

89
00:17:40:00 --> 00:17:43:06
magic, it has its spirit, red

90
00:17:43:06 --> 00:17:47:16
It is what keeps everything in us Wayuu, it is what protects,

91
00:17:48:15 --> 00:17:49:22
is the one who,

92
00:17:49:22 --> 00:17:52:10
I mean that's the one that,

93
00:17:52:10 --> 00:17:55:10
where we respect the color red more

94
00:17:56:00 --> 00:17:59:10
because it symbolizes many things in the Wayuu culture,

95
00:18:00:07 --> 00:18:02:18
because he is the one who keeps, he is the one who gives the dream,

96
00:18:02:18 --> 00:18:04:11
It is the one that reveals dreams,

97
00:18:04:11 --> 00:18:08:07
He is the one who has to do with everything, he is the one who takes care of us. One

98
00:18:08:07 --> 00:18:08:23
take this

99
00:18:08:23 --> 00:18:13:01
to be able to get something out of the mountain or get something out of a tree,

100
00:18:13:01 --> 00:18:16:07
One wears a red patch or

101
00:18:16:08 --> 00:18:18:22
a piece of red thread.

102
00:18:18:22 --> 00:18:21:22
These are the oldest skein threads there,

103
00:18:22:14 --> 00:18:24:07
I don't think they sell them anymore.

104
00:18:24:07 --> 00:18:26:08
That,

105
00:18:26:08 --> 00:18:29:11
If a piece is left on the mountain it is for power,

106
00:18:29:11 --> 00:18:33:06
talk to the spirit of the plants, so one can

107
00:18:33:08 --> 00:18:36:18
Grab part of those plants, why not grab it and that's it

108
00:18:36:23 --> 00:18:39:18
You sit there to talk to them,

109
00:18:39:18 --> 00:18:43:12
to ask, to give change, to say

110
00:18:43:22 --> 00:18:47:15
Well, I come to ask you to give me this,

111
00:18:47:15 --> 00:18:49:16
and I leave you this in exchange,

112
00:18:49:16 --> 00:18:51:11
that's how we talk to him

113
00:18:51:11 --> 00:18:55:07
And one wears his red cloth too or one dresses in red

114
00:18:55:07 --> 00:18:56:12
to look for all this.

115
00:18:56:12 --> 00:18:58:23
It's not that one is getting off to a bad start.

116
00:18:58:23 --> 00:19:01:22
Because? because there are people who just go and start, not like that

117
00:19:01:22 --> 00:19:02:22
further.

118
00:19:02:22 --> 00:19:03:21
How is it?

119
00:19:03:21 --> 00:19:05:01
they go blind,

120
00:19:05:01 --> 00:19:08:20
They are left with other defects that one day they will leave it

121
00:19:09:07 --> 00:19:12:20
Because? because their spirituality does not respect them.

122
00:19:13:12 --> 00:19:15:20
Each one has their spirituality,

123
00:19:15:20 --> 00:19:16:22
there is male and female

124
00:19:16:22 --> 00:19:17:19
like us,

125
00:19:17:19 --> 00:19:21:14
like us there are women and there are men, like this

126
00:19:21:14 --> 00:19:22:03
the plants

127
00:19:22:03 --> 00:19:25:06
There is also in that aspect.

128
00:19:26:00 --> 00:19:28:05
That's why they each

129
00:19:28:05 --> 00:19:30:20
one fulfills his function.

130
00:19:33:00 --> 00:19:33:21
What is it for

131
00:19:33:21 --> 00:19:36:16
each one already has its function, each one has its

132
00:19:36:16 --> 00:19:38:02
function.

133
00:19:38:02 --> 00:19:41:02
He fulfills his role.

134
00:19:44:16 --> 00:19:46:01
And when are you going

135
00:19:46:01 --> 00:19:49:01
well searching, harvesting,

136
00:19:49:07 --> 00:19:51:23
does that also happen with a thread?

137
00:19:51:23 --> 00:19:55:03
You leave him, you don't leave him just like that

138
00:19:55:03 --> 00:19:56:08
because they don't have a hand,

139
00:19:56:08 --> 00:20:00:00
one goes where the root is, one digs and buries

140
00:20:00:04 --> 00:20:03:03
leave what has to be, it can be a necklace

141
00:20:03:14 --> 00:20:07:13
because that necklace is because I'm not going to wear it again

142
00:20:07:18 --> 00:20:10:03
this, this stays there forever

143
00:20:10:03 --> 00:20:13:22
and he is also staying with one, because yes

144
00:20:13:22 --> 00:20:16:18
There is one who says no, I am going to make the change another day,

145
00:20:16:18 --> 00:20:19:11
I'm going to change with something else. No it can not be done.

146
00:20:19:11 --> 00:20:20:21
Now what you gave him

147
00:20:20:21 --> 00:20:21:18
I already said it. Already

148
00:20:21:18 --> 00:20:23:10
what you started is already for you,

149
00:20:23:10 --> 00:20:24:19
you are never going to return it,

150
00:20:25:18 --> 00:20:28:12
That's how it is, that's why one has to respect it.

151
00:20:28:12 --> 00:20:31:00
Is it always an exchange?

152
00:20:31:00 --> 00:20:33:01
It's always an exchange one

153
00:20:33:01 --> 00:20:36:21
one, because we humans to protect from them

154
00:20:36:23 --> 00:20:40:01
we are present, because they are the ones who protect one.

155
00:20:40:09 --> 00:20:43:09
Spirituality, what one respects,

156
00:20:43:12 --> 00:20:45:11
the tradition of grandparents,

157
00:20:45:11 --> 00:20:49:01
just as they left them, so we have to continue, so

158
00:20:49:01 --> 00:20:51:01
we have to teach our children,

159
00:20:51:01 --> 00:20:53:20
so they will also respect.

160
00:20:53:20 --> 00:20:57:08
One has to teach them respect for the plant,

161
00:20:57:08 --> 00:21:02:03
towards all this, just as we teach to respect

162
00:21:02:14 --> 00:21:05:22
to other people, like this

163
00:21:05:22 --> 00:21:08:20
we have to teach our children, our grandchildren,

164
00:21:08:20 --> 00:21:10:17
to respect this.

165
00:21:10:17 --> 00:21:13:04
What they have, because those are theirs,

166
00:21:13:04 --> 00:21:15:04
because they are in their territory.

167
00:21:15:04 --> 00:21:17:21
We don't get this from another territory, it's from here

168
00:21:17:21 --> 00:21:19:14
Of the territory

169
00:21:19:14 --> 00:21:23:22
Uriana, from here all this mountain range, this mountain range

170
00:21:23:22 --> 00:21:26:19
It is full of everything, which is what it doesn't have,

171
00:21:26:19 --> 00:21:28:03
He even has amulets.
Amulets?

172
00:21:30:00 --> 00:21:30:16
Of course

173
00:21:30:16 --> 00:21:31:02
that is

174
00:21:31:02 --> 00:21:31:23
very reserved,

175
00:21:31:23 --> 00:21:34:14
That is not here within this, that is separate.

176
00:21:34:14 --> 00:21:37:05
That has

177
00:21:37:05 --> 00:21:40:04
even more respect, because they can even

178
00:21:40:08 --> 00:21:43:05
ask for expensive things,

179
00:21:43:05 --> 00:21:47:00
They can ask for gold or they can ask for a beef to eat,

180
00:21:47:00 --> 00:21:48:01
so that one can grasp

181
00:21:48:01 --> 00:21:50:00
that.

182
00:21:50:00 --> 00:21:53:00
Even more expensive than this.

183
00:21:53:00 --> 00:21:53:05
By

184
00:21:53:05 --> 00:21:57:14
that we respect that part and the grandparents know

185
00:21:58:10 --> 00:22:03:03
What each thing is for is that and it teaches one and

186
00:22:03:03 --> 00:22:03:17
One too

187
00:22:03:17 --> 00:22:06:19
reserve it as they reserved it, then

188
00:22:06:19 --> 00:22:09:19
we also reserve,

189
00:22:09:23 --> 00:22:11:19
We keep it in there.

190
00:22:11:19 --> 00:22:13:13
The most we know.

191
00:22:13:13 --> 00:22:16:12
When one wants it is from one that a person crawls

192
00:22:16:12 --> 00:22:19:11
I want, I want, it is done.

193
00:22:19:16 --> 00:22:20:12
As?

194
00:22:20:12 --> 00:22:23:10
How are you

195
00:22:23:10 --> 00:22:24:08
It is already done.

196
00:22:24:08 --> 00:22:25:18
This is done. It's dry.

197
00:22:25:18 --> 00:22:27:11
This is already macerated, dry.

198
00:22:28:14 --> 00:22:29:03
This is

199
00:22:29:03 --> 00:22:29:20
macerated.

200
00:22:29:20 --> 00:22:30:14
This is

201
00:22:30:14 --> 00:22:32:19
another species of plant, but that cannot be

202
00:22:32:19 --> 00:22:35:19
nor place in plain sight.

203
00:22:36:08 --> 00:22:38:11
Because?

204
00:22:38:11 --> 00:22:41:03
Because that is one

205
00:22:41:03 --> 00:22:44:01
for the preservation of the baby in the mother's womb.

206
00:22:44:01 --> 00:22:47:00
So that he doesn't get the evil eye, so that he doesn't get

207
00:22:47:00 --> 00:22:48:20
pain in childbirth when going to

208
00:22:48:20 --> 00:22:50:18
give birth to a person

209
00:22:50:18 --> 00:22:53:22
What did they do when there was no doctor before?

210
00:22:54:04 --> 00:22:55:13
It is with that, all

211
00:22:55:13 --> 00:22:58:13
Those plants. And it was bought, it was changed

212
00:22:58:13 --> 00:23:01:13
for a goat, for one of these things.

213
00:23:01:19 --> 00:23:03:04
For a goat,

214
00:23:03:04 --> 00:23:05:20
For a goat worth this

215
00:23:05:20 --> 00:23:08:20
at that time. Because now no,

216
00:23:09:07 --> 00:23:09:18
that now

217
00:23:09:18 --> 00:23:14:08
If my baby goes through, that's a cesarean section, go to the hospital,

218
00:23:15:15 --> 00:23:18:08
Not before, it's with that, that's it.

219
00:23:18:08 --> 00:23:20:21
That's why the midwife is there, there are the

220
00:23:20:21 --> 00:23:24:19
people best suited for that. Is the person that

221
00:23:26:03 --> 00:23:27:22
will do the echogram

222
00:23:27:22 --> 00:23:31:02
Wayuu, who see sex and everything.

223
00:23:31:05 --> 00:23:35:05
Of course, that's why they are called Wayuu echograms because they fix that.

224
00:23:36:04 --> 00:23:38:14
and they come and say right away, this one is female, this one

225
00:23:38:14 --> 00:23:39:13
It is male,

226
00:23:39:13 --> 00:23:42:13
so it's in the belly.

227
00:23:43:23 --> 00:23:46:23
Let's get started.

228
00:23:48:11 --> 00:23:50:18
This is a maraca,

229
00:23:50:18 --> 00:23:53:18
Let's start and here we are with the reds.

230
00:23:54:11 --> 00:23:56:17
Then the maraca,

231
00:23:56:17 --> 00:23:59:15
This is the first who gives life, the one who saves

232
00:23:59:15 --> 00:24:01:09
all.

233
00:24:01:09 --> 00:24:03:05
Through Yüi (marijuana) which is

234
00:24:03:05 --> 00:24:05:23
the tobacco leaf from here, from Macuira,

235
00:24:05:23 --> 00:24:07:11
This is what they also call Macuira,

236
00:24:07:11 --> 00:24:10:11
This is the Macuira.

237
00:24:10:23 --> 00:24:11:14
Tobacco that

238
00:24:11:14 --> 00:24:14:12
They are from here, because there are tobaccos that are very

239
00:24:14:12 --> 00:24:16:06
different from this.

240
00:24:16:06 --> 00:24:19:06
Instead of tobacco they write Macuira.

241
00:24:21:02 --> 00:24:22:02
And does it come from here?

242
00:24:22:02 --> 00:24:23:07
Is that why the name?

243
00:24:23:07 --> 00:24:26:15
He was born here and are from here originally,

244
00:24:26:15 --> 00:24:26:23
from here.

245
00:24:28:06 --> 00:24:30:18
They are very typical from here,

246
00:24:30:18 --> 00:24:31:15
it's tobacco

247
00:24:31:15 --> 00:24:34:09
this.

248
00:24:34:09 --> 00:24:35:14
and this one who, the

249
00:24:35:14 --> 00:24:38:19
that calls the spirit of this, when one eats it

250
00:24:38:20 --> 00:24:39:10
it already works

251
00:24:39:10 --> 00:24:40:14
to cure everything.

252
00:24:40:14 --> 00:24:41:22
And so they were all born

253
00:24:41:22 --> 00:24:44:05
these.

254
00:24:44:05 --> 00:24:46:02
In the middle

255
00:24:46:02 --> 00:24:48:01
of that,

256
00:24:48:01 --> 00:24:50:20
of that spiritualist who

257
00:24:50:20 --> 00:24:52:03
exists in our

258
00:24:52:03 --> 00:24:55:03
culture.

259
00:24:57:14 --> 00:24:58:06
AND

260
00:24:58:06 --> 00:25:01:04
this is a species

261
00:25:01:04 --> 00:25:03:10
of rattan,

262
00:25:03:10 --> 00:25:05:11
that's here too,

263
00:25:05:11 --> 00:25:08:11
This is also there in the Serranía de Perijá,

264
00:25:09:00 --> 00:25:11:06
of this, there are things that are

265
00:25:11:06 --> 00:25:14:06
far away and exists here with us.

266
00:25:14:18 --> 00:25:15:05
As?

267
00:25:15:05 --> 00:25:20:12
Because God put it, that's how it has to be, because that's what they are,

268
00:25:20:12 --> 00:25:24:04
They are from a cold land and where there is a river and that

269
00:25:24:14 --> 00:25:27:14
and here it occurs where there is no river.

270
00:25:30:08 --> 00:25:31:15
This.

271
00:25:31:15 --> 00:25:34:01
This serves to

272
00:25:34:01 --> 00:25:36:16
When one makes a fracture, then one

273
00:25:36:16 --> 00:25:38:00
part of the bone and that,

274
00:25:39:16 --> 00:25:41:19
it scratches

275
00:25:41:19 --> 00:25:44:19
with a stone, it is placed, it has its,

276
00:25:46:17 --> 00:25:49:16
his diet, his diet is long,

277
00:25:50:01 --> 00:25:52:10
there are things that should not be eaten,

278
00:25:52:10 --> 00:25:55:10
the meats, the cheese most of all, the milk.

279
00:25:56:15 --> 00:25:58:05
This with this.

280
00:25:58:05 --> 00:25:59:23
When you are taking that, you can't?

281
00:25:59:23 --> 00:26:00:17
It can't be done,

282
00:26:00:17 --> 00:26:02:23
has to be under confinement

283
00:26:02:23 --> 00:26:05:00
with this because it works quickly

284
00:26:05:00 --> 00:26:05:18
and

285
00:26:05:18 --> 00:26:07:11
the bone is composed quickly

286
00:26:07:11 --> 00:26:10:12
and returns to its normal state.

287
00:26:11:15 --> 00:26:13:11
And that thing about the

288
00:26:13:11 --> 00:26:16:12
the music there?

289
00:26:17:04 --> 00:26:18:07
No,

290
00:26:18:07 --> 00:26:21:15
Now that, now that, another different magic is coming and this

291
00:26:21:15 --> 00:26:24:22
and those things that are already from here.

292
00:26:26:10 --> 00:26:29:10
And they are also powerful because,

293
00:26:30:16 --> 00:26:32:14
Why does it have its magic and that,

294
00:26:32:14 --> 00:26:33:20
and

295
00:26:33:20 --> 00:26:37:09
with people who dream, that's what maceration does.

296
00:26:37:09 --> 00:26:37:20
It's this one.

297
00:26:42:22 --> 00:26:46:04
Here are some, some leaves of a plant

298
00:26:46:04 --> 00:26:50:05
which is useful for the person who has menstrual cramps.

299
00:26:50:11 --> 00:26:53:18
This serves those who suffer from it.

300
00:26:54:09 --> 00:26:56:05
With this,

301
00:26:56:05 --> 00:26:56:20
these are

302
00:26:56:20 --> 00:27:01:09
leaves, they are from here too. This is when the person already

303
00:27:01:09 --> 00:27:04:09
they are giving them cancer,

304
00:27:04:17 --> 00:27:06:22
when she is already getting cancer in the womb,

305
00:27:06:22 --> 00:27:08:01
when it comes

306
00:27:08:01 --> 00:27:11:11
bleeding and it is frequent and with this you can

307
00:27:12:00 --> 00:27:15:00
and it has a smell of,

308
00:27:15:09 --> 00:27:17:21
Of,

309
00:27:17:21 --> 00:27:20:21
from the rotten matrix.

310
00:27:22:12 --> 00:27:25:12
Happens.
What is your name?

311
00:27:26:00 --> 00:27:29:00
That's a kind of hawapi,

312
00:27:30:19 --> 00:27:32:21
when the person can no longer

313
00:27:32:21 --> 00:27:37:04
more and those days it is already rotting, to save it

314
00:27:37:04 --> 00:27:38:15
he saves himself with that.

315
00:27:38:15 --> 00:27:40:12
As? miracles are done

316
00:27:40:12 --> 00:27:43:12
with that.

317
00:27:43:19 --> 00:27:46:03
It is very miraculous.

318
00:27:46:03 --> 00:27:48:04
This for us,

319
00:27:48:04 --> 00:27:50:16
of an illness of us women.

320
00:27:50:16 --> 00:27:52:17
When you get an infection there

321
00:27:52:17 --> 00:27:54:21
in the matrix everything

322
00:27:55:22 --> 00:27:56:16
fixes it.

323
00:27:56:16 --> 00:27:59:09
And it is so important because before, as there was no

324
00:27:59:09 --> 00:28:02:20
doctor, how did you get your womb removed?

325
00:28:02:20 --> 00:28:05:22
nothing, there is no one, because people were dying,

326
00:28:06:09 --> 00:28:08:22
You could and you would die, there was no more.

327
00:28:08:22 --> 00:28:09:23
Not now.

328
00:28:09:23 --> 00:28:10:20
And that the person

329
00:28:10:20 --> 00:28:14:01
and this one is expensive, they sell it, they don't show it at all,

330
00:28:14:01 --> 00:28:15:04
but,

331
00:28:15:04 --> 00:28:18:02
They show him when he is like this,

332
00:28:18:02 --> 00:28:20:10
but not in leaves like that, I am

333
00:28:20:10 --> 00:28:23:05
I dare to do this now

334
00:28:23:05 --> 00:28:24:17
with you.

335
00:28:24:17 --> 00:28:26:10
Uh-huh, sure.

336
00:28:26:10 --> 00:28:27:19
Everything has its change,

337
00:28:27:19 --> 00:28:29:09
as I say.

338
00:28:29:09 --> 00:28:32:09
This is the baby's bath,

339
00:28:32:09 --> 00:28:35:09
when he is newborn he is the special one for them

340
00:28:35:11 --> 00:28:37:19
naked

341
00:28:37:19 --> 00:28:40:15
For baths and the Majayülü (lady in menarche) afterwards,

342
00:28:40:15 --> 00:28:42:14
when you get off the hammock and the

343
00:28:42:14 --> 00:28:45:09
confinement, this bathes him for a month,

344
00:28:45:09 --> 00:28:47:13
He bathes with this.

345
00:28:47:13 --> 00:28:51:09
And this is also taken so that you do not get sick,

346
00:28:51:09 --> 00:28:54:17
Because the matrix also shrinks, too

347
00:28:54:22 --> 00:28:58:05
this one and it is very common because this one is very well known

348
00:28:58:06 --> 00:28:58:13
here,

349
00:28:59:19 --> 00:28:59:23
No

350
00:28:59:23 --> 00:29:02:23
They are like there are some that are not, you can hardly see them.

351
00:29:04:13 --> 00:29:05:23
You have to walk.
Which one is that?

352
00:29:05:23 --> 00:29:09:05
It is the naked Indian.

353
00:29:11:19 --> 00:29:12:15
and this is the

354
00:29:12:15 --> 00:29:15:15
the bija leaf

355
00:29:15:22 --> 00:29:16:17
and that

356
00:29:16:17 --> 00:29:19:16
women also take it

357
00:29:20:13 --> 00:29:22:05
Confinement, at the time of his puberty.

358
00:29:22:05 --> 00:29:23:05
This.

359
00:29:23:05 --> 00:29:25:14
And also the newly born ones,

360
00:29:25:14 --> 00:29:26:19
they take it.

361
00:29:26:19 --> 00:29:30:11
And the child drinks and the newborn to clean

362
00:29:31:03 --> 00:29:31:13
the

363
00:29:31:13 --> 00:29:35:22
phlegm and in there what he fed with the

364
00:29:35:22 --> 00:29:39:00
Mom, you have to clean it, it stays very clean.

365
00:29:46:19 --> 00:29:49:08
And this is another kind of

366
00:29:49:08 --> 00:29:52:08
Jawapi, they take this

367
00:29:53:09 --> 00:29:56:04
women after childbirth.

368
00:29:56:04 --> 00:29:57:19
This.

369
00:29:57:19 --> 00:29:59:11
And it is very common of this too.

370
00:30:01:20 --> 00:30:04:20
They are not from the mountains, from here in the region,

371
00:30:05:07 --> 00:30:08:07
flat part.

372
00:30:08:13 --> 00:30:10:01
How do you find them?

373
00:30:11:09 --> 00:30:12:02
are you?

374
00:30:12:02 --> 00:30:15:02
How do you find them in the mountains?

375
00:30:15:14 --> 00:30:18:21
What is found in the mountains is different, like this one,

376
00:30:19:19 --> 00:30:23:02
This is in the mountains, it doesn't exist here,

377
00:30:23:02 --> 00:30:27:09
on the flat part, on the lower part, it is

378
00:30:29:00 --> 00:30:31:17
It is the anamu.

379
00:30:31:17 --> 00:30:34:16
And how do you know which is which when you're searching?

380
00:30:34:16 --> 00:30:35:15
As

381
00:30:35:15 --> 00:30:38:21
one knows it by the smell and everything by the leaf, everything

382
00:30:38:22 --> 00:30:42:18
indigenous people know what it is, this is the anamú, which is good

383
00:30:43:01 --> 00:30:45:19
carcinogenic

384
00:30:45:19 --> 00:30:47:01
and to

385
00:30:47:01 --> 00:30:49:09
the flu too

386
00:30:49:09 --> 00:30:51:00
and a lot.

387
00:30:51:00 --> 00:30:54:23
And this is another one too, the Guazuma, this is the Guazuma,

388
00:30:56:06 --> 00:30:58:05
this is the one that,

389
00:30:58:05 --> 00:31:00:11
this one works for everyone

390
00:31:00:11 --> 00:31:03:11
viruses, as if to say

391
00:31:03:11 --> 00:31:06:05
for whooping cough.

392
00:31:06:05 --> 00:31:09:11
Everything that has to do with measles, smallpox

393
00:31:10:02 --> 00:31:12:19
When you get old, then this is where

394
00:31:15:05 --> 00:31:16:15
boiled,

395
00:31:16:15 --> 00:31:21:09
It is taken in panela and also when diarrhea occurs.

396
00:31:21:17 --> 00:31:24:16
acute that there is almost no cure, and people

397
00:31:24:16 --> 00:31:27:16
now you can, now with this

398
00:31:27:17 --> 00:31:30:16
for.

399
00:31:33:02 --> 00:31:34:16
How is it done?

400
00:31:34:16 --> 00:31:37:10
Is taken

401
00:31:37:10 --> 00:31:39:08
It is not macerated, it is taken

402
00:31:41:00 --> 00:31:44:12
And this is also another, another line of,

403
00:31:45:01 --> 00:31:45:12
of

404
00:31:45:12 --> 00:31:47:23
those bitter ones too

405
00:31:47:23 --> 00:31:50:23
takes the Majayülü in their confinement too,

406
00:31:51:01 --> 00:31:55:06
people who are sickly, who are skinny,

407
00:31:56:01 --> 00:31:59:03
that she looks like an old lady, she takes it and turns back

408
00:31:59:03 --> 00:32:01:10
plump and shiny.

409
00:32:01:10 --> 00:32:03:22
With this.

410
00:32:03:22 --> 00:32:06:22
But hey, it's good, isn't it?

411
00:32:06:22 --> 00:32:09:21
smell it

412
00:32:09:21 --> 00:32:12:08
you can take it

413
00:32:12:08 --> 00:32:12:22
No.

414
00:32:12:22 --> 00:32:15:23
Not for Neko who is there.

415
00:32:16:06 --> 00:32:17:10
Something I know.

416
00:32:17:10 --> 00:32:20:10
Put.

417
00:32:22:03 --> 00:32:25:03
And yet it has.

418
00:32:25:07 --> 00:32:26:17
AHA.

419
00:32:26:17 --> 00:32:28:07
As you know.

420
00:32:28:07 --> 00:32:30:09
Forks. For.

421
00:32:30:09 --> 00:32:32:20
And this is the famous Wararat (Bejuco) that

422
00:32:32:20 --> 00:32:36:08
It is the vine that is here, it is bitter and if this

423
00:32:37:12 --> 00:32:38:06
HE

424
00:32:38:06 --> 00:32:42:21
it takes a lot, here they are used quite a bit in the territory

425
00:32:42:21 --> 00:32:46:00
and in other places they look for it, you buy it in pieces like that

426
00:32:46:00 --> 00:32:48:07
They sell it where there is none.

427
00:32:48:07 --> 00:32:50:07
On the other hand, here one has it like this.

428
00:32:50:07 --> 00:32:51:15
Because

429
00:32:51:15 --> 00:32:54:15
Of course because here we have it, we are rich in these.

430
00:32:55:23 --> 00:32:58:11
What is your name?

431
00:32:58:11 --> 00:33:01:17
Wararat as a kind of vine, like a vine.

432
00:33:02:22 --> 00:33:04:10
So they are the

433
00:33:04:10 --> 00:33:07:15
and he has a lot of family about this,

434
00:33:08:08 --> 00:33:10:22
They have a lot of family, different, different.

435
00:33:10:22 --> 00:33:14:07
There are white and brown and there are this color.

436
00:33:15:08 --> 00:33:17:03
And do they have a smell?

437
00:33:17:03 --> 00:33:20:04
It has a smell and it has a taste and it has feet to

438
00:33:20:04 --> 00:33:22:12
burping in people whose stomach is full

439
00:33:22:12 --> 00:33:25:13
and they can't one day and not again,

440
00:33:25:18 --> 00:33:28:01
with this it is cleaned and

441
00:33:28:01 --> 00:33:31:03
that everything is bad for him and with this he gets better,

442
00:33:32:03 --> 00:33:35:03
it is cleaned, it is purified.

443
00:33:40:07 --> 00:33:43:02
And this is another species of jawapi,

444
00:33:43:02 --> 00:33:47:06
This is what Majayülü takes in the running of the bulls.

445
00:33:47:19 --> 00:33:49:19
This.

446
00:33:49:19 --> 00:33:50:21
Can you explain

447
00:33:50:21 --> 00:33:53:14
for someone who doesn't know, what is the running of the bulls?

448
00:33:54:01 --> 00:33:58:12
The confinement of what, of the Majayülü, or any confinement?

449
00:33:59:10 --> 00:34:02:14
the one that represents the beginning for women, right?

450
00:34:03:15 --> 00:34:07:01
Of course the Majayülü do their confinement, the mothers,

451
00:34:07:01 --> 00:34:08:05
we mothers,

452
00:34:08:05 --> 00:34:11:21
The grandmothers, we do the running of the bulls, for what purpose?

453
00:34:11:23 --> 00:34:13:00
So that?

454
00:34:13:00 --> 00:34:16:09
Because that girl is going to spend her life

455
00:34:16:23 --> 00:34:20:13
to be a woman, she is no longer a girl, she is now a woman

456
00:34:21:07 --> 00:34:25:09
and this woman has to value what she is too.

457
00:34:25:09 --> 00:34:28:13
Before society she is no longer a girl, she is now a woman who

458
00:34:28:13 --> 00:34:31:13
she's going to be, she's going to be a mother one day,

459
00:34:31:16 --> 00:34:34:05
she's going to be a grandmother, she's not going to be anymore

460
00:34:34:05 --> 00:34:36:08
the same toys from yesterday,

461
00:34:36:08 --> 00:34:41:05
This is another role and those where women settle

462
00:34:41:05 --> 00:34:44:22
and the girls to read, where one teaches them everything,

463
00:34:45:07 --> 00:34:49:08
to knitting, to work, in the kitchen, in everything,

464
00:34:49:08 --> 00:34:54:14
in everything, what her job is, what she is going to do one day

465
00:34:55:17 --> 00:34:56:18
and what I eat

466
00:34:56:18 --> 00:34:59:17
She is going to be seen before society.

467
00:34:59:20 --> 00:35:02:04
She deserves your respect.

468
00:35:02:04 --> 00:35:05:09
All that she can't be touching like before,

469
00:35:05:09 --> 00:35:07:13
so she grabbed the other child and pushed him

470
00:35:07:13 --> 00:35:11:01
because that will no longer be touching that child

471
00:35:11:07 --> 00:35:12:10
nor to the other, nothing,

472
00:35:12:10 --> 00:35:15:15
but she is going to do her job now

473
00:35:15:15 --> 00:35:17:08
and it will be respected.

474
00:35:17:08 --> 00:35:20:08
He who dares to grab her is because

475
00:35:21:00 --> 00:35:24:00
They want to pay a goat for the performance.

476
00:35:25:10 --> 00:35:28:10
Yes, that is a very big respect.

477
00:35:28:19 --> 00:35:29:01
No

478
00:35:29:01 --> 00:35:32:16
because he didn't give us that, no, not more for the touch, that

479
00:35:32:17 --> 00:35:35:17
It can't be for him either,

480
00:35:35:20 --> 00:35:38:20
must be respected.

481
00:35:41:01 --> 00:35:41:19
and this plant

482
00:35:41:19 --> 00:35:44:19
It is very good for phlegm,

483
00:35:45:05 --> 00:35:46:14
Mashulü (cotton leaves)

484
00:35:46:14 --> 00:35:47:06
Is

485
00:35:47:06 --> 00:35:49:01
this good for phlegm,

486
00:35:49:01 --> 00:35:52:19
when a child is born with phlegm and suffers from that and with this

487
00:35:52:19 --> 00:35:53:05
it does,

488
00:35:54:12 --> 00:35:55:14
are made of,

489
00:35:55:14 --> 00:35:58:22
It becomes a winter thing, it is baptized.

490
00:36:02:07 --> 00:36:02:16
And this

491
00:36:02:16 --> 00:36:05:16
It is another type of vine too.

492
00:36:07:01 --> 00:36:08:12
This is for

493
00:36:08:12 --> 00:36:11:03
a person who does not want to have more children,

494
00:36:11:03 --> 00:36:13:23
let that be so,

495
00:36:13:23 --> 00:36:16:09
This is…

496
00:36:16:09 --> 00:36:17:21
Don't you want to have more children?

497
00:36:17:21 --> 00:36:20:03
Whether

498
00:36:20:03 --> 00:36:23:03
you want to sterilize, well, you take this,

499
00:36:23:23 --> 00:36:25:20
A bun is made with this amount.

500
00:36:25:20 --> 00:36:28:10
And this

501
00:36:28:10 --> 00:36:30:21
is

502
00:36:30:21 --> 00:36:32:12
the famous Kepisuta

503
00:36:32:12 --> 00:36:32:21
this

504
00:36:32:21 --> 00:36:36:11
It is the bath for babies and is also used for flu and

505
00:36:36:18 --> 00:36:39:18
It's a good bath.

506
00:36:39:18 --> 00:36:41:12
And this the Cortex of the

507
00:36:41:12 --> 00:36:43:22
Carob tree,

508
00:36:43:22 --> 00:36:45:05
which is very good too

509
00:36:45:05 --> 00:36:48:05
to clean the blood

510
00:36:48:10 --> 00:36:50:19
and when one,

511
00:36:50:19 --> 00:36:53:13
when one sees that one

512
00:36:53:13 --> 00:36:55:22
It gives him reluctance and everything, so with this

513
00:36:55:22 --> 00:36:57:22
the blood is cleaned.

514
00:37:06:01 --> 00:37:09:08
This one they call Bacchus's eye is called Chi'pira,

515
00:37:10:04 --> 00:37:13:07
That's in the mountains, it's a kind of

516
00:37:13:07 --> 00:37:15:05
bejuco

517
00:37:16:05 --> 00:37:18:05
What purpose does that serve in our culture?

518
00:37:18:05 --> 00:37:23:20
This helps so that when they are given to children, children,

519
00:37:25:02 --> 00:37:28:05
Not the girls, let's go with the boys, with the men.

520
00:37:29:01 --> 00:37:32:12
It is given to children when they later develop

521
00:37:32:12 --> 00:37:35:17
Also, it is saved for a day and it is taken.

522
00:37:36:06 --> 00:37:38:09
So that? For your health,

523
00:37:38:09 --> 00:37:42:12
so that the rum does not become so tampered with

524
00:37:42:12 --> 00:37:45:12
someday, when they go to take their chirinche.

525
00:37:46:00 --> 00:37:49:16
It's not going to be rigged, but they measure their rum with it.

526
00:37:51:06 --> 00:37:54:06
And this is also Soluou'ta, it is a kind of

527
00:37:54:11 --> 00:37:57:01
very good for pain, for inflammation,

528
00:37:57:01 --> 00:37:59:18
To reduce inflammation it can be

529
00:37:59:18 --> 00:38:02:09
a blow, a bruise.

530
00:38:02:09 --> 00:38:05:12
Or it could be, it could also be

531
00:38:05:18 --> 00:38:09:08
When you get a toothache, you scratch it, it macerates.

532
00:38:10:09 --> 00:38:11:09
with this already

533
00:38:11:09 --> 00:38:13:11
goodbye pain.

534
00:38:13:11 --> 00:38:16:11
San Diego Dentistry.

535
00:38:17:17 --> 00:38:18:03
And that

536
00:38:18:03 --> 00:38:21:03
It is also for a phlegm, this is also, they are

537
00:38:21:12 --> 00:38:23:04
They are… What is it called?

538
00:38:23:04 --> 00:38:26:00
They call it cloud, those live over there

539
00:38:26:00 --> 00:38:29:04
in the mountains up there and it is called a cloud,

540
00:38:30:08 --> 00:38:32:07
yes because he is the one who calls the clouds,

541
00:38:32:07 --> 00:38:34:21
the cloud goes down in the mountains, because there is enough of that

542
00:38:34:21 --> 00:38:36:07
Up there.

543
00:38:36:07 --> 00:38:37:09
And this also works,

544
00:38:37:09 --> 00:38:40:00
because the phlegm and illness of children

545
00:38:40:00 --> 00:38:43:00
newly born.

546
00:38:44:21 --> 00:38:46:19
Which one is missing?

547
00:38:46:19 --> 00:38:48:17
Come on let's go with this one.

548
00:38:48:17 --> 00:38:50:03
Well, that's what I said.

549
00:38:50:03 --> 00:38:53:03
So this one is, this one is for,

550
00:38:54:07 --> 00:38:56:18
for the person when they are pregnant,

551
00:38:56:18 --> 00:38:59:22
so that there is no pain when she is going to give birth

552
00:39:01:01 --> 00:39:03:01
he takes it when he already has his,

553
00:39:03:01 --> 00:39:06:01
when he is nine months old, eight months already

554
00:39:06:01 --> 00:39:07:12
to give birth,

555
00:39:07:12 --> 00:39:10:17
that happens and maceration is also done

556
00:39:11:16 --> 00:39:12:04
in a

557
00:39:12:04 --> 00:39:16:04
chirinche and rub the belly so that the baby

558
00:39:17:06 --> 00:39:18:15
don't be born with evil

559
00:39:18:15 --> 00:39:20:23
eye and with other things.

560
00:39:20:23 --> 00:39:23:06
And this is for the evil of

561
00:39:23:06 --> 00:39:26:06
spirit.

562
00:39:26:07 --> 00:39:27:04
This is for

563
00:39:27:04 --> 00:39:30:04
the evil of spirit. When a person suffers from a bad spirit,

564
00:39:30:21 --> 00:39:33:17
This is taken, grated and

565
00:39:33:17 --> 00:39:35:04
take

566
00:39:35:04 --> 00:39:38:07
And that evil spirit that is bothering you goes away,

567
00:39:39:05 --> 00:39:41:11
may be cause of,

568
00:39:41:11 --> 00:39:42:07
of,

569
00:39:42:07 --> 00:39:47:01
other things that are not natural, can be false,

570
00:39:47:17 --> 00:39:50:17
So it pushes him away.

571
00:39:52:01 --> 00:39:54:00
And this is a seed that is a seed

572
00:39:54:00 --> 00:39:57:00
that comes from other parts, they are from cold land

573
00:39:57:05 --> 00:40:00:19
and here we also use it to cure diseases,

574
00:40:01:12 --> 00:40:04:12
also of

575
00:40:04:13 --> 00:40:05:22
for,

576
00:40:05:22 --> 00:40:08:01
serves for

577
00:40:08:01 --> 00:40:10:01
this serves to,

578
00:40:10:01 --> 00:40:13:01
It's called Sekuanrü,

579
00:40:14:23 --> 00:40:16:01
What is it for?

580
00:40:16:01 --> 00:40:19:01
It serves to reduce inflammation.

581
00:40:26:12 --> 00:40:27:15
That more than anything else.

582
00:40:29:03 --> 00:40:29:15
Ah!

583
00:40:29:15 --> 00:40:30:18
To wonder.

584
00:40:30:18 --> 00:40:35:06
This is the wonder that serves as a bathroom,

585
00:40:36:07 --> 00:40:37:18
to reduce the

586
00:40:37:18 --> 00:40:40:18
fever

587
00:40:40:18 --> 00:40:43:12
and to deworm

588
00:40:43:12 --> 00:40:45:06
also.

589
00:40:45:06 --> 00:40:48:12
Deworm more than in children the roots are used,

590
00:40:49:17 --> 00:40:52:13
It is counted that only one is cooked so that

591
00:40:52:13 --> 00:40:54:01
take.

592
00:40:54:01 --> 00:40:56:04
And there is also another dewormer,

593
00:40:56:04 --> 00:40:57:09
It's also this one.

594
00:40:57:09 --> 00:41:00:09
This seed that is from the great granite,

595
00:41:01:16 --> 00:41:03:06
It is there,

596
00:41:03:06 --> 00:41:04:14
The great granite.

597
00:41:04:14 --> 00:41:07:14
With this

598
00:41:07:15 --> 00:41:10:15
which when it is made has a brown color

599
00:41:11:10 --> 00:41:12:02
and this here

600
00:41:12:02 --> 00:41:13:08
this

601
00:41:13:08 --> 00:41:16:06
it is macerated and taken,

602
00:41:16:06 --> 00:41:18:07
for the parasite

603
00:41:18:07 --> 00:41:21:01
and also the animals

604
00:41:21:01 --> 00:41:23:13
They burn it and it gets into the donkey's anus

605
00:41:23:13 --> 00:41:24:18
when there is also a cover,

606
00:41:24:18 --> 00:41:27:07
that no longer shits,

607
00:41:27:07 --> 00:41:30:00
so to make him shit it is like a suppository

608
00:41:30:00 --> 00:41:32:17
for the animals.

609
00:41:32:17 --> 00:41:33:18
AHA.

610
00:41:33:18 --> 00:41:34:15
Good.

611
00:41:34:15 --> 00:41:37:15
Do they also need?

612
00:41:38:02 --> 00:41:39:11
and this is the famous tua tua,

613
00:41:39:11 --> 00:41:42:17
This tua tua has,

614
00:41:44:02 --> 00:41:47:02
has, vote liquid

615
00:41:47:12 --> 00:41:50:12
and that liquid that is here is useful for sight.

616
00:41:51:01 --> 00:41:52:10
When it gets dirty

617
00:41:52:10 --> 00:41:55:10
in the eyes then they get,

618
00:41:55:13 --> 00:41:56:09
he puts that on.

619
00:41:56:09 --> 00:41:59:11
And it also serves to,

620
00:41:59:23 --> 00:42:01:00
for

621
00:42:01:00 --> 00:42:04:05
clean the blood and to lose weight

622
00:42:04:07 --> 00:42:07:02
this.

623
00:42:07:02 --> 00:42:10:14
A very fat person, with a lot of fat and a paunch

624
00:42:10:14 --> 00:42:13:14
and take this and it is ready.

625
00:42:16:19 --> 00:42:17:06
AHA.

626
00:42:17:06 --> 00:42:18:12
And this,

627
00:42:18:12 --> 00:42:21:08
the festival,

628
00:42:21:08 --> 00:42:22:08
this is the festival

629
00:42:22:08 --> 00:42:25:08
what we call the scorpion tail,

630
00:42:25:18 --> 00:42:27:12
It's a vulgar name.

631
00:42:27:12 --> 00:42:29:20
Aja Aja.

632
00:42:29:20 --> 00:42:32:16
This is used for infection

633
00:42:32:16 --> 00:42:35:04
in the throat

634
00:42:35:04 --> 00:42:36:21
and internally too.

635
00:42:36:21 --> 00:42:39:21
This.

636
00:42:54:23 --> 00:42:56:20
This one too

637
00:42:56:20 --> 00:42:59:20
It's called bija, they call it bija, white bija and

638
00:43:00:11 --> 00:43:03:11
This spice is malua that we call,

639
00:43:03:18 --> 00:43:06:18
These are typical from here too,

640
00:43:06:23 --> 00:43:09:23
not like malambo, because malambo is from somewhere else.

641
00:43:10:03 --> 00:43:13:03
On the other hand, this one here is very typical from here.

642
00:43:13:16 --> 00:43:16:16
and this is for Buddhism,

643
00:43:17:03 --> 00:43:20:07
that one can take it too and one can burn it too.

644
00:43:20:07 --> 00:43:22:14
And with this it is also done

645
00:43:23:18 --> 00:43:25:07
It has its rituality.

646
00:43:25:07 --> 00:43:27:22
It is also to distance

647
00:43:27:22 --> 00:43:31:16
To the evil spirits in the houses and it burns like yes

648
00:43:31:19 --> 00:43:34:05
out,

649
00:43:34:05 --> 00:43:37:05
that…

650
00:43:37:05 --> 00:43:38:09
There are many ways

651
00:43:38:09 --> 00:43:41:09
how to avoid diseases with this

652
00:43:42:07 --> 00:43:45:18
and that's why children use handles and

653
00:43:46:19 --> 00:43:47:12
to what end?

654
00:43:47:12 --> 00:43:50:12
because they are going to keep away the diseases,

655
00:43:50:19 --> 00:43:53:19
of flu from other things.

656
00:43:54:09 --> 00:43:54:16
That's why

657
00:43:54:16 --> 00:43:56:21
we use it quite a bit.

658
00:44:06:01 --> 00:44:08:06
And then what is like anti COVID?

659
00:44:08:06 --> 00:44:11:15
Which of those did they use during COVID?

660
00:44:12:10 --> 00:44:13:23
This.

661
00:44:13:23 --> 00:44:14:20
This is the one that

662
00:44:14:20 --> 00:44:17:13
We call Wasim.

663
00:44:17:13 --> 00:44:20:13
Anti-COVID and there is also,

664
00:44:20:14 --> 00:44:21:21
Wararat

665
00:44:21:21 --> 00:44:24:07
How did you know that this worked against COVID?

666
00:44:24:07 --> 00:44:27:06
What is that process of knowing what plant

667
00:44:27:12 --> 00:44:29:15
is it used for what things?

668
00:44:29:15 --> 00:44:30:20
And this too,

669
00:44:30:20 --> 00:44:34:15
This almost subsides in almost half of the

670
00:44:34:15 --> 00:44:36:00
mountain range, of these

671
00:44:36:00 --> 00:44:38:11
They take it and sell it around, they take it to save

672
00:44:38:11 --> 00:44:39:21
Uribia's brothers.

673
00:44:41:03 --> 00:44:42:18
They looted them in the hills behind this.

674
00:44:42:18 --> 00:44:45:05
This why

675
00:44:45:05 --> 00:44:48:20
In reality, it is what saves many lives

676
00:44:49:14 --> 00:44:52:14
and thank God we are here because we have it

677
00:44:53:06 --> 00:44:54:03
here.

678
00:44:54:03 --> 00:44:55:18
Here that pod

679
00:44:55:18 --> 00:44:58:18
It didn't arrive, it did arrive here, but we scared them away.

680
00:45:04:08 --> 00:45:06:14
Well, it's just that what's here

681
00:45:06:14 --> 00:45:09:14
Right now these are the few,

682
00:45:10:04 --> 00:45:13:13
Because if I had everyone here, better said,

683
00:45:13:20 --> 00:45:16:20
It would be all day.

684
00:45:19:03 --> 00:45:22:06
Those are the ones I'm showing you,

685
00:45:22:06 --> 00:45:23:17
for now.

686
00:45:23:17 --> 00:45:26:17
I already explained

687
00:45:26:18 --> 00:45:28:23
colors.

688
00:45:28:23 --> 00:45:30:13
And also,

689
00:45:30:13 --> 00:45:33:13
can explain some of the yonna,

690
00:45:34:02 --> 00:45:37:11
dance, dance, I don't know, are you one who teaches

691
00:45:37:11 --> 00:45:37:17
right?

692
00:45:37:17 --> 00:45:39:21
Oh yes I am one of the teachers

693
00:45:39:21 --> 00:45:41:19
those who want to learn from.

694
00:45:41:19 --> 00:45:43:02
AHA.

695
00:45:43:02 --> 00:45:45:06
Uh-huh, sure.

696
00:45:45:06 --> 00:45:45:23
And yes.

697
00:45:45:23 --> 00:45:48:22
So what does the yonna mean, when it is danced?

698
00:45:49:07 --> 00:45:50:21
And for what?

699
00:45:50:21 --> 00:45:52:16
What is it for?

700
00:45:54:02 --> 00:45:56:06
that's what we call that

701
00:45:56:06 --> 00:45:58:15
If this is the Outsü

702
00:45:58:15 --> 00:46:01:15
"He gets drunk with this," Yonna asks.

703
00:46:01:22 --> 00:46:05:03
And that is why there are the variants of the yonna.

704
00:46:05:12 --> 00:46:06:18
What are the variants?

705
00:46:06:18 --> 00:46:10:19
What they imitated from animals later,

706
00:46:10:19 --> 00:46:12:08
because the common

707
00:46:12:08 --> 00:46:13:01
is the step

708
00:46:13:01 --> 00:46:16:01
common that we call that are from our ancestors,

709
00:46:16:06 --> 00:46:18:22
that they were the first that they learned

710
00:46:18:22 --> 00:46:21:17
to do that

711
00:46:21:17 --> 00:46:24:17
Epichikua, which is the one that,

712
00:46:25:04 --> 00:46:27:08
which

713
00:46:27:08 --> 00:46:28:11
he begat the yonna

714
00:46:28:11 --> 00:46:28:23
here

715
00:46:28:23 --> 00:46:32:09
on earth, when in those times, in times

716
00:46:32:09 --> 00:46:35:09
remote.

717
00:46:37:03 --> 00:46:39:01
And when one dances?

718
00:46:39:01 --> 00:46:40:08
One?

719
00:46:40:08 --> 00:46:44:13
One dances yonna when the Outsü orders

720
00:46:45:14 --> 00:46:49:07
If there is going to be a yonna, when there is a sick person, he locks himself in,

721
00:46:49:07 --> 00:46:52:10
It is saved and when the people leave,

722
00:46:52:11 --> 00:46:54:04
the family has to be happy,

723
00:46:54:04 --> 00:46:55:20
It has to make you want to dance,

724
00:46:55:20 --> 00:46:58:00
because one is not going to have his yonna

725
00:46:58:00 --> 00:47:00:13
Having a sick person doesn't make you want to do anything,

726
00:47:00:13 --> 00:47:02:19
like you just want to cry,

727
00:47:02:19 --> 00:47:05:01
but one is happy to see him

728
00:47:05:01 --> 00:47:07:07
He has healed the child and the Majayülü

729
00:47:07:07 --> 00:47:09:05
and when you lower it too

730
00:47:09:05 --> 00:47:12:12
because it has to come out before society, before it

731
00:47:12:12 --> 00:47:13:09
see enough,

732
00:47:14:19 --> 00:47:16:22
the yonna is made, the feast is made,

733
00:47:16:22 --> 00:47:19:22
You know that you have to get out, that you are going to get out.

734
00:47:33:19 --> 00:47:37:05
There are many types of doing the yonna,

735
00:47:37:16 --> 00:47:40:09
at housewarmings,

736
00:47:40:09 --> 00:47:43:09
It is the marking of animals.

737
00:47:43:17 --> 00:47:48:19
At the inauguration of the orchards, the graves

738
00:47:50:05 --> 00:47:53:02
There is a lot, a lot, a lot.

739
00:47:53:02 --> 00:47:55:16
When you inaugurate the water, when you do your

740
00:47:55:16 --> 00:47:58:16
Wells, when already,

741
00:47:59:02 --> 00:48:02:02
when, when Juya (old father)

742
00:48:02:03 --> 00:48:03:05
He

743
00:48:03:05 --> 00:48:04:07
He is angry with us and

744
00:48:04:07 --> 00:48:07:19
he doesn't want to come, so you call him on the drum

745
00:48:08:14 --> 00:48:11:14
As? eating roasted corn,

746
00:48:11:14 --> 00:48:15:01
eating grit (Sa'wa) all that

747
00:48:15:01 --> 00:48:18:01
calling him there, appreciating that he comes,

748
00:48:18:15 --> 00:48:22:00
that someone talks to him, someone tells him you don't see me as dirty, you

749
00:48:22:00 --> 00:48:25:11
You don't see sweaty, one goes and dances and one has to wallow

750
00:48:25:11 --> 00:48:28:11
the sand so that it can see that one is dirty, that one

751
00:48:28:11 --> 00:48:29:12
you need it,

752
00:48:29:12 --> 00:48:32:16
one is calling him, one like that with the spirit.

753
00:48:33:11 --> 00:48:35:16
Of course, everything that has to do with

754
00:48:35:16 --> 00:48:36:18
and that goes from house to house.

755
00:48:36:18 --> 00:48:39:01
So at home one cannot say there is no food,

756
00:48:39:01 --> 00:48:41:16
because if one says, one goes wrong,

757
00:48:41:16 --> 00:48:44:04
cannot say, one has to consume

758
00:48:44:04 --> 00:48:45:21
whether it be beans or whatever,

759
00:48:45:21 --> 00:48:49:06
not so much the meat but the beans that he loves and

760
00:48:50:00 --> 00:48:51:22
scrambled with toasted corn.

761
00:48:53:06 --> 00:48:54:11
Yeah.

762
00:48:54:11 --> 00:48:57:03
Those traditions are no longer seen,

763
00:48:57:03 --> 00:49:00:03
That is rather dying,

764
00:49:00:23 --> 00:49:03:00
but you have to revive it, one

765
00:49:03:00 --> 00:49:06:01
you have to remember, one has to do that

766
00:49:06:19 --> 00:49:08:11
so that

767
00:49:08:11 --> 00:49:12:05
the little ones who were born after one see it

768
00:49:12:05 --> 00:49:16:01
and they also have to familiarize themselves with that

769
00:49:16:01 --> 00:49:17:12
And they have to feel

770
00:49:17:12 --> 00:49:19:15
that are theirs, that are their culture,

771
00:49:19:15 --> 00:49:22:21
that you don't have to feel sorry for him or be afraid of

772
00:49:23:13 --> 00:49:26:12
exit on the Piyoi which is the Yonna track.

773
00:49:27:15 --> 00:49:29:06
You have to lose your fear.

774
00:49:29:06 --> 00:49:32:06
There are people who are afraid of traveling too.

775
00:49:32:18 --> 00:49:36:00
Does painting also have to do with

776
00:49:36:11 --> 00:49:37:16
part of culture?

777
00:49:37:16 --> 00:49:40:15
Of course makeup is so important too.

778
00:49:40:15 --> 00:49:44:00
because that's what goes with it, it's what accompanies

779
00:49:45:07 --> 00:49:47:19
and the red scarf too

780
00:49:47:19 --> 00:49:50:19
that accompanies the Yonna.

781
00:49:50:19 --> 00:49:53:12
On the runway, makeup, accessories,

782
00:49:53:12 --> 00:49:56:12
all that has to do with it.

783
00:49:56:15 --> 00:49:57:01
And you

784
00:49:57:01 --> 00:50:00:13
What is your relationship with nature or with plants

785
00:50:00:13 --> 00:50:03:02
or with this place?

786
00:50:03:02 --> 00:50:04:03
With Macuira?

787
00:50:04:03 --> 00:50:07:03
Take care of them and respect them.

788
00:50:07:03 --> 00:50:08:21
Ujum,

789
00:50:08:21 --> 00:50:09:12
No no.

790
00:50:09:12 --> 00:50:12:17
Don't take out so much just to have it there,

791
00:50:12:17 --> 00:50:14:04
you know that when something is

792
00:50:14:04 --> 00:50:17:04
so important that one is going to use it, it is not,

793
00:50:17:14 --> 00:50:19:18
He's not going to take it out just to have it there,

794
00:50:19:18 --> 00:50:22:18
but to use it for whatever is useful.

795
00:50:24:12 --> 00:50:25:16
It's very curious,

796
00:50:25:16 --> 00:50:28:16
like this time about medicinal plants.

797
00:50:29:06 --> 00:50:31:08
Of course, since we have this opportunity here,

798
00:50:31:08 --> 00:50:33:06
Now we don't start them just to start,

799
00:50:33:06 --> 00:50:36:06
but because you have to see what

800
00:50:36:08 --> 00:50:38:22
We are going to do with the plant, we do not throw it away without doing anything.

801
00:50:38:22 --> 00:50:40:04
when you were little

802
00:50:40:04 --> 00:50:43:15
how did you discover that you wanted to know more?

803
00:50:43:15 --> 00:50:44:15
Learn more about this?

804
00:50:46:16 --> 00:50:49:11
I through my ancestors, through the elders,

805
00:50:49:11 --> 00:50:53:18
the elderly, it can be a man or a woman, but one goes

806
00:50:53:18 --> 00:50:54:09
and one

807
00:50:54:09 --> 00:50:55:06
investigate, one

808
00:50:55:06 --> 00:50:58:05
He does his interview with them, what is it for,

809
00:50:58:16 --> 00:51:00:11
at what point can one grab it,

810
00:51:00:11 --> 00:51:03:11
Why? Why is it so important?

811
00:51:04:15 --> 00:51:05:17
what is your reason,

812
00:51:05:17 --> 00:51:08:09
their actions towards us?

813
00:51:08:09 --> 00:51:11:09
You ask all those questions with old people.

814
00:51:25:03 --> 00:51:28:08
Not everyone can be Outsü

815
00:51:29:09 --> 00:51:31:00
No.

816
00:51:31:00 --> 00:51:34:15
Those are hereditary, those are hereditary

817
00:51:34:15 --> 00:51:36:12
What if their grandparents had

818
00:51:36:12 --> 00:51:37:23
anywhere it can be

819
00:51:37:23 --> 00:51:39:09
mom's side or dad's side

820
00:51:39:09 --> 00:51:42:09
If they liked one, I accept it.

821
00:51:42:18 --> 00:51:43:19
And there are some who

822
00:51:43:19 --> 00:51:46:09
I'm not afraid, I'm not going to accept it,

823
00:51:46:09 --> 00:51:51:04
He is very strong and he puts in everything, no, he is good at it,

824
00:51:52:00 --> 00:51:55:00
because as there are three types of

825
00:51:55:01 --> 00:51:58:01
those spiritualisms.

826
00:51:58:02 --> 00:52:00:09
There is lalüi, there

827
00:52:00:09 --> 00:52:04:06
He is the one who dreams and his dreams are true,

828
00:52:06:02 --> 00:52:08:22
when that gives its predictions

829
00:52:08:22 --> 00:52:12:18
Well, things happen before they happen,

830
00:52:13:07 --> 00:52:16:09
the things that are going to happen, they tell you in a dream,

831
00:52:17:05 --> 00:52:20:05
just as it is going to happen, so it has to be,

832
00:52:21:07 --> 00:52:22:11
but wich ones?

833
00:52:22:11 --> 00:52:23:19
Why do they dream?

834
00:52:23:19 --> 00:52:26:05
Because to avoid,

835
00:52:26:05 --> 00:52:29:04
to keep it away, to avoid it, to stop it from continuing,

836
00:52:29:14 --> 00:52:34:00
so that he does not fall into such bad things, with bad temptations

837
00:52:34:14 --> 00:52:39:10
They warn you beforehand, the alüi is the one who sees the most in the dream.

838
00:52:40:04 --> 00:52:43:21
On the other hand, Outsü looks for the spirit,

839
00:52:45:02 --> 00:52:48:08
read the ashes,

840
00:52:49:15 --> 00:52:50:23
in the,

841
00:52:50:23 --> 00:52:55:21
in firewood, a firewood is used

842
00:52:59:08 --> 00:53:02:04
tender and burns.

843
00:53:02:04 --> 00:53:05:04
So there it does connect with that,

844
00:53:05:12 --> 00:53:09:21
with the ashes of what is happening, what is going to happen.

845
00:53:10:17 --> 00:53:14:07
Yes it is an evil eye on a child, if it is for

846
00:53:14:07 --> 00:53:15:19
inaugurate a house,

847
00:53:15:19 --> 00:53:18:19
Yes, the devil is there, if he lives there, we must stay away,

848
00:53:19:01 --> 00:53:22:15
You have to not put him in his way, you have to keep him away from there,

849
00:53:23:03 --> 00:53:26:07
ask them for the land, the site.

850
00:53:28:10 --> 00:53:29:15
In exchange for?

851
00:53:29:15 --> 00:53:31:03
Then one asks for the change,

852
00:53:31:03 --> 00:53:33:06
If they say in the change,

853
00:53:33:06 --> 00:53:33:19
that I want

854
00:53:33:19 --> 00:53:36:21
a black goat, no, I want a red goat

855
00:53:37:01 --> 00:53:38:05
and that red goat

856
00:53:38:05 --> 00:53:41:21
how it should be eaten, like this, if it is in soup, if it is stewed,

857
00:53:42:00 --> 00:53:46:12
That's what their tobacco says, which I didn't use before.

858
00:53:46:15 --> 00:53:49:15
The one who uses tobacco is the piachi (Oulaküt)

859
00:53:50:00 --> 00:53:53:00
The Piache is the one who uses tobacco and

860
00:53:53:07 --> 00:53:55:08
chirinche

861
00:53:55:08 --> 00:53:57:10
And sometimes they are not so correct

862
00:53:57:10 --> 00:54:00:10
The Piaches are already people who

863
00:54:01:10 --> 00:54:04:04
works with the devil and who works with the good spirit

864
00:54:04:04 --> 00:54:07:04
with the evil spirit and so on.

865
00:54:07:05 --> 00:54:08:06
That's why they call him

866
00:54:08:06 --> 00:54:10:17
witches

867
00:54:10:17 --> 00:54:12:23
Because they do good things and

868
00:54:12:23 --> 00:54:15:11
bad things, and the negative part

869
00:54:15:11 --> 00:54:18:02
and the positive part does good things.

870
00:54:18:02 --> 00:54:22:15
On the other hand, Outsü does the right thing, does its

871
00:54:22:15 --> 00:54:23:05
job.

872
00:54:25:03 --> 00:54:26:19
He hides nothing what

873
00:54:26:19 --> 00:54:30:06
He says, whether he wants to or not, but I'm going to tell him,

874
00:54:30:21 --> 00:54:36:08
Tell me if you have, if you have a patient there

875
00:54:36:08 --> 00:54:39:16
there he is going to die, he says no, I think I can't anymore

876
00:54:39:16 --> 00:54:42:12
But with this one, this one is going to die.

877
00:54:42:12 --> 00:54:46:09
Why am I going to insist so much if this no longer exists?

878
00:54:46:09 --> 00:54:49:19
He already left for Jeepira and I can't get the oxen anymore,

879
00:54:49:19 --> 00:54:53:02
He's no longer on the road, I didn't reach him, he's already gone.

880
00:54:53:23 --> 00:54:56:23
That is why family members have to be satisfied,

881
00:54:57:04 --> 00:55:00:04
What are you going to do if Outsü already told the truth.

882
00:55:00:16 --> 00:55:03:08
On the other hand, the other too, which is the alüi,

883
00:55:03:08 --> 00:55:06:00
then that is the one who works only with dreams

884
00:55:06:00 --> 00:55:09:00
and work with plants and work with other things

885
00:55:09:03 --> 00:55:10:17
and they are also true.

886
00:55:10:17 --> 00:55:13:07
In all their things, they are strict in their things.

887
00:55:14:15 --> 00:55:17:12
Well, that's what we talked about,

888
00:55:17:12 --> 00:55:19:14
They are different.

889
00:55:19:14 --> 00:55:21:15
And now comes a spiritualism

890
00:55:21:15 --> 00:55:24:14
now with the Piache that is beginning to

891
00:55:24:14 --> 00:55:25:13
sleep

892
00:55:25:13 --> 00:55:28:00
deep and then the voice changes

893
00:55:28:00 --> 00:55:31:11
and to say that I don't know, it means that no, that I don't

894
00:55:31:11 --> 00:55:34:21
wronged, that they did you wrong, that

895
00:55:35:07 --> 00:55:37:18
There is a funeral there in your house,

896
00:55:37:18 --> 00:55:40:18
You don't have to take him out for so many.

897
00:55:40:20 --> 00:55:42:22
They say now.

898
00:55:42:22 --> 00:55:45:00
That you have a doll there,

899
00:55:45:00 --> 00:55:48:18
that I'm going to get it for so many, that if they give me that much yes

900
00:55:48:18 --> 00:55:52:03
and if they give me necklaces and they give me goats and they give me cows and they give me

901
00:55:52:14 --> 00:55:55:07
my amount of money, well

902
00:55:55:07 --> 00:55:56:20
That's pure business.

903
00:55:56:20 --> 00:56:00:14
Now, that Outsü no longer exists and the Alüi no longer exists.

904
00:56:00:17 --> 00:56:04:15
There are some, but they are isolated in the community and in the family,

905
00:56:04:23 --> 00:56:06:07
in some. There is

906
00:56:06:07 --> 00:56:09:15
some who still believe that, there are others who don't, they

907
00:56:10:07 --> 00:56:13:02
They say I'm not going to send him out and

908
00:56:13:02 --> 00:56:15:18
they tie her hair

909
00:56:17:11 --> 00:56:18:20
on the other Outsü

910
00:56:18:20 --> 00:56:21:22
which is the most practical to what they are there

911
00:56:23:03 --> 00:56:26:03
that since they are new,

912
00:56:26:10 --> 00:56:29:10
can be removed.

913
00:56:30:06 --> 00:56:31:03
There are some that do

914
00:56:31:03 --> 00:56:34:10
They say that, if I want, well they settle it and

915
00:56:34:22 --> 00:56:35:01
it

916
00:56:35:01 --> 00:56:37:16
They do with their teacher and learn and do

917
00:56:37:16 --> 00:56:39:16
things,

918
00:56:39:16 --> 00:56:41:18
the Outsü

919
00:56:41:18 --> 00:56:43:22
It's the one that, the one that

920
00:56:43:22 --> 00:56:46:07
first he knew all the

921
00:56:46:07 --> 00:56:49:04
floors

922
00:56:49:04 --> 00:56:50:19
through their spirits

923
00:56:50:19 --> 00:56:54:01
and every day new ones explode

924
00:56:54:01 --> 00:56:57:01
things.

925
00:56:57:02 --> 00:56:59:00
Throughout,

926
00:56:59:00 --> 00:57:01:17
the same in the light and also with your dream explodes

927
00:57:01:17 --> 00:57:03:15
new things and meet new

928
00:57:03:15 --> 00:57:07:02
no, the grandparents, the family doesn't know him

929
00:57:07:17 --> 00:57:10:03
and suddenly he knows them, why?

930
00:57:10:03 --> 00:57:12:17
Because they send him to look for him where he is,

931
00:57:12:17 --> 00:57:14:02
there it is and it's useful for this

932
00:57:14:02 --> 00:57:14:11
and that,

933
00:57:14:11 --> 00:57:17:11
I have given him his explanation as it is, how he has to work.

934
00:57:19:22 --> 00:57:21:09
Very good.

935
00:57:21:09 --> 00:57:23:18
Well.

936
00:57:23:18 --> 00:57:26:18
That is the origin of all this.

937
00:57:31:05 --> 00:57:33:14
Well, we've talked about magic and that, what?

938
00:57:33:14 --> 00:57:37:10
is magic for you or more like spirituality?

939
00:57:38:04 --> 00:57:41:06
Not the magic is the spirits, the Aseyuu

940
00:57:41:21 --> 00:57:44:09
what we call the spirit,

941
00:57:44:09 --> 00:57:48:12
that one does not see, but one feels it, one asks for it,

942
00:57:48:13 --> 00:57:49:07
They warn you

943
00:57:49:07 --> 00:57:49:09
to

944
00:57:49:09 --> 00:57:53:21
one, is the one who gives one the power, everything, are things

945
00:57:53:21 --> 00:57:57:15
powerful, it is a powerful spirit that one

946
00:57:57:15 --> 00:58:00:15
He doesn't know if he is there, if he is here, if he is with us,

947
00:58:01:10 --> 00:58:04:10
That is with us at the moment, because this is here,

948
00:58:05:00 --> 00:58:08:00
That is in us, but we do not feel it,

949
00:58:08:09 --> 00:58:11:09
We don't see it, but we do feel it because

950
00:58:12:21 --> 00:58:13:19
I'm sorry.

951
00:58:13:19 --> 00:58:16:19
I don't know if you feel it.

952
00:58:17:13 --> 00:58:19:00
The question also to

953
00:58:20:05 --> 00:58:21:18
you

954
00:58:21:18 --> 00:58:22:19
is

955
00:58:22:19 --> 00:58:25:19
many say that the

956
00:58:26:04 --> 00:58:28:18
the ancestors of one they already lost

957
00:58:28:18 --> 00:58:29:19
life, right,

958
00:58:29:19 --> 00:58:32:19
they connect with the Outsü

959
00:58:33:08 --> 00:58:35:12
to help her with certain things,

960
00:58:35:12 --> 00:58:38:12
how to avoid

961
00:58:38:23 --> 00:58:40:07
accidents and things like that.

962
00:58:40:07 --> 00:58:41:06
They tell them, I dreamed about my grandmother she told me

963
00:58:41:06 --> 00:58:45:02
to bathe my daughter

964
00:58:46:14 --> 00:58:50:22
That is that spirit is when it uses the body

965
00:58:50:22 --> 00:58:54:06
of the person who believes in magic,

966
00:58:54:07 --> 00:58:57:06
who has that ritual, who believes in their belief

967
00:58:57:19 --> 00:59:01:21
live with her, that's why she sends you to that person,

968
00:59:02:14 --> 00:59:05:02
because he doesn't tell everyone, I wish it were

969
00:59:05:02 --> 00:59:09:07
So, I told him everything, his everything, we would all know everything,

970
00:59:09:13 --> 00:59:12:08
we would all be wise,

971
00:59:12:08 --> 00:59:14:22
because that has to be a chosen person

972
00:59:14:22 --> 00:59:18:02
for that person to whom you want to talk, to whom you want to tell

973
00:59:18:02 --> 00:59:18:22
his things,

974
00:59:18:22 --> 00:59:21:13
to those who want to prevent things that cannot happen.

975
00:59:23:06 --> 00:59:26:06
That's what happens.

976
00:59:27:01 --> 00:59:27:21
And also it

977
00:59:27:21 --> 00:59:30:21
older ones, those that no longer exist

978
00:59:31:00 --> 00:59:34:04
You also feel the purest smell at night.

979
00:59:35:04 --> 00:59:36:13
Who are these people?

980
00:59:36:13 --> 00:59:39:13
The old people who lived in that territory,

981
00:59:39:18 --> 00:59:42:18
the old people who are underground and buried.

982
00:59:43:02 --> 00:59:47:12
They walk by the spirit, but one does not see,

983
00:59:47:19 --> 00:59:50:01
We then Wayuu believe so much,

984
00:59:50:01 --> 00:59:52:05
so we feel that smell at night.

985
00:59:52:05 --> 00:59:53:15
You have to set up the coffee,

986
00:59:53:15 --> 00:59:56:09
We have to make coffee, grandpa has arrived, grandma has arrived

987
00:59:56:09 --> 00:59:59:09
to toast, poor thing, comes to visit us.

988
00:59:59:22 --> 01:00:02:08
Well, since they lived here, that was theirs,

989
01:00:02:08 --> 01:00:04:07
here they had their roses, here they had

990
01:00:04:07 --> 01:00:04:20
his bower,

991
01:00:04:20 --> 01:00:06:02
here they had their little house,

992
01:00:06:02 --> 01:00:09:03
They had good traces of her here.

993
01:00:09:04 --> 01:00:12:04
It's around here that they urinated like this.

994
01:00:12:04 --> 01:00:13:22
One believes that.

995
01:00:13:22 --> 01:00:15:16
That's why they come to visit him.

996
01:00:15:16 --> 01:00:18:16
She doesn't come to do harm, she comes to visit,

997
01:00:18:22 --> 01:00:21:22
but from time to time he doesn't come here every time.

998
01:00:22:08 --> 01:00:24:21
There are some who are also quick-tempered.

999
01:00:24:21 --> 01:00:27:01
That also starts to scream at him

1000
01:00:27:01 --> 01:00:30:01
well, get out of here, you're not going to be there,

1001
01:00:30:09 --> 01:00:33:19
there with your bad smell here, because you have to

1002
01:00:34:00 --> 01:00:35:17
shake your ugly panties

1003
01:00:35:17 --> 01:00:38:01
here, shake it further, he tells him

1004
01:00:39:11 --> 01:00:40:09
and makes the maraca

1005
01:00:40:09 --> 01:00:43:03
So

1006
01:00:43:03 --> 01:00:44:10
nothing else

1007
01:00:44:10 --> 01:00:47:04
and immediately the smell disappears,

1008
01:00:47:04 --> 01:00:49:16
because that is a belief.

1009
01:00:49:16 --> 01:00:49:21
That

1010
01:00:49:21 --> 01:00:52:07
still lives, still exists

1011
01:00:52:07 --> 01:00:55:07
here with us.

1012
01:00:57:06 --> 01:01:00:21
We already mentioned

1013
01:01:02:01 --> 01:01:04:19
right now the Outsü can see the traces

1014
01:01:04:19 --> 01:01:08:04
of the souls that have already left for Jeepira, you could speak

1015
01:01:09:00 --> 01:01:11:02
What happens to the soul according to culture

1016
01:01:11:02 --> 01:01:12:18
of us?

1017
01:01:12:18 --> 01:01:15:07
well it is said that they are going to Jeepira and all that.

1018
01:01:15:07 --> 01:01:17:00
Could you talk about that?

1019
01:01:17:00 --> 01:01:18:19
Of course, Jeepira

1020
01:01:18:19 --> 01:01:20:11
It's a place, it's a place,

1021
01:01:20:11 --> 01:01:21:09
They say it is

1022
01:01:21:09 --> 01:01:25:08
a kind of ravine that we don't know if it is in the sky,

1023
01:01:25:08 --> 01:01:27:06
yes it is here on earth,

1024
01:01:27:06 --> 01:01:29:11
but it is between us.

1025
01:01:29:11 --> 01:01:32:11
That's not something from another world.

1026
01:01:32:14 --> 01:01:34:22
It can be in the sea or

1027
01:01:34:22 --> 01:01:37:22
It can be here on earth.

1028
01:01:38:06 --> 01:01:40:00
That is a belief, because

1029
01:01:41:14 --> 01:01:43:12
That exists, but

1030
01:01:43:12 --> 01:01:46:06
but there are others, but like us sometimes

1031
01:01:46:06 --> 01:01:49:11
The literature of the Bible says that heaven is over there,

1032
01:01:50:11 --> 01:01:51:16
that when we die

1033
01:01:51:16 --> 01:01:54:07
over there, one is no longer left with that literature

1034
01:01:54:07 --> 01:01:57:06
and that's what the ancestors say, they say that Jeepira

1035
01:01:58:03 --> 01:02:00:16
is here with us, is it in the sea or is it

1036
01:02:00:16 --> 01:02:03:16
here with the earth

1037
01:02:03:20 --> 01:02:04:17
where we start,

1038
01:02:04:17 --> 01:02:08:14
We do not leave, but we lay down our bones,

1039
01:02:08:23 --> 01:02:10:10
the bones are lying,

1040
01:02:10:10 --> 01:02:13:00
but the soul continues to live with people,

1041
01:02:13:00 --> 01:02:14:20
the old people say.

1042
01:02:14:20 --> 01:02:18:10
Where? Yes when they are tired of being here, they

1043
01:02:18:10 --> 01:02:22:01
Now the land for them is the sea, they are in the sea.

1044
01:02:23:18 --> 01:02:26:04
Is that also related

1045
01:02:26:04 --> 01:02:29:09
why they have two wakes, can you explain that?

1046
01:02:30:06 --> 01:02:31:05
So.

1047
01:02:31:05 --> 01:02:33:06
Which wake?

1048
01:02:33:06 --> 01:02:34:23
The exhumation?

1049
01:02:34:23 --> 01:02:37:17
Of course, the exhumation is another wake.

1050
01:02:37:17 --> 01:02:39:03
It is already

1051
01:02:39:03 --> 01:02:42:03
when people come back again,

1052
01:02:42:11 --> 01:02:43:17
they come back

1053
01:02:43:17 --> 01:02:47:05
At the moment when the body is exhumed they return.

1054
01:02:47:14 --> 01:02:51:15
Now if they can go again, they won't come back again.

1055
01:02:52:04 --> 01:02:55:04
I say that they return to look at their remains,

1056
01:02:55:04 --> 01:02:56:14
to look at people.

1057
01:02:56:14 --> 01:02:58:09
That's why the exhumers

1058
01:02:58:09 --> 01:03:01:09
one tells them when it is a woman and takes

1059
01:03:01:21 --> 01:03:04:07
rest of a man, one tells him,

1060
01:03:04:07 --> 01:03:06:06
They greet him after his exhumation

1061
01:03:06:06 --> 01:03:07:16
already washed and everything clean.

1062
01:03:07:16 --> 01:03:09:13
He says oh my grandfather arrived.

1063
01:03:09:13 --> 01:03:12:11
Grandpa tells her, she could be a woman,

1064
01:03:12:11 --> 01:03:15:08
the one he is exhuming, but because she already lives with him

1065
01:03:15:08 --> 01:03:18:23
and his spirit, his soul lives with him and is in his heart.

1066
01:03:19:14 --> 01:03:22:23
One tells him “grandpa has arrived, how is grandpa?”

1067
01:03:22:23 --> 01:03:23:18
everyone says,

1068
01:03:25:06 --> 01:03:28:08
because, because she just exhumed the rest of her

1069
01:03:28:08 --> 01:03:29:20
grandfather.

1070
01:03:29:20 --> 01:03:32:14
When she is one, when she is also a woman,

1071
01:03:32:14 --> 01:03:35:03
and the man is,

1072
01:03:35:03 --> 01:03:36:08
the one who exhumes is a man,

1073
01:03:36:08 --> 01:03:39:20
then one also says to her “oh grandma”,

1074
01:03:39:21 --> 01:03:40:06
And says

1075
01:03:40:06 --> 01:03:41:06
then he like

1076
01:03:41:06 --> 01:03:44:02
just think about your current situation

1077
01:03:44:02 --> 01:03:47:02
He says “not at all, be serious” (said)

1078
01:03:47:16 --> 01:03:48:02
I don't

1079
01:03:48:02 --> 01:03:49:00
like that they

1080
01:03:49:00 --> 01:03:52:09
say like that, because of course, because you think about nothing more,

1081
01:03:52:16 --> 01:03:55:16
He does not think about the spirit he is exhuming.

1082
01:03:56:14 --> 01:03:59:03
That's what it is.

1083
01:03:59:03 --> 01:04:01:10
and let's say the sugar curtain

1084
01:04:01:10 --> 01:04:04:10
is a place where they also go

1085
01:04:04:15 --> 01:04:07:16
when people die or not?

1086
01:04:08:08 --> 01:04:12:10
No, they call it the end of the candle, not those are literatures that...

1087
01:04:13:16 --> 01:04:16:16
but if the Jeepirachi,

1088
01:04:16:19 --> 01:04:19:19
Jeepirachi is the name of a hill that is inside the sea.

1089
01:04:20:09 --> 01:04:20:20
Aha.

1090
01:04:20:20 --> 01:04:25:14
So that's the place, because I looked into that too.

1091
01:04:26:13 --> 01:04:28:07
What's up with that?

1092
01:04:28:07 --> 01:04:30:06
There are some gentlemen, there were, they lived

1093
01:04:30:06 --> 01:04:31:08
but they no longer exist,

1094
01:04:31:08 --> 01:04:33:22
gentlemen who lived close to him,

1095
01:04:33:22 --> 01:04:35:22
They moved over time later,

1096
01:04:35:22 --> 01:04:37:12
because I couldn't take it anymore

1097
01:04:37:12 --> 01:04:40:12
with the moo of the cow the meow of the sheep,

1098
01:04:40:12 --> 01:04:44:18
the barking of the dog, the braying of the donkey and all that

1099
01:04:44:18 --> 01:04:46:03
what it feels,

1100
01:04:46:03 --> 01:04:50:10
the child's cry, the old woman's cry, the stove and so on.

1101
01:04:50:10 --> 01:04:53:20
And there are things, even the drum feels there

1102
01:04:54:19 --> 01:04:56:12
on that hill,

1103
01:04:56:12 --> 01:04:58:18
inside that sea.

1104
01:04:58:18 --> 01:05:00:06
So they,

1105
01:05:00:06 --> 01:05:03:05
once they were how many, many goats

1106
01:05:03:05 --> 01:05:04:12
has its people

1107
01:05:04:12 --> 01:05:07:15
and in the day there is nothing, but at night it is the thing,

1108
01:05:08:06 --> 01:05:12:13
starting at 11 pm, they feel that way there. So what

1109
01:05:14:02 --> 01:05:15:10
They moved away,

1110
01:05:15:10 --> 01:05:20:08
because because the old man was looking he saw logs, he lit

1111
01:05:20:08 --> 01:05:21:18
he saw everything.

1112
01:05:21:18 --> 01:05:24:15
There were voices and all that.

1113
01:05:24:15 --> 01:05:27:15
And he fell asleep alone.

1114
01:05:27:15 --> 01:05:30:23
So what are you doing spying on us?

1115
01:05:31:08 --> 01:05:33:04
If you still want to live here,

1116
01:05:33:04 --> 01:05:36:04
Either you come here or you stay there still!

1117
01:05:37:05 --> 01:05:39:07
you move, go where

1118
01:05:39:07 --> 01:05:42:07
They told him, vacate this.

1119
01:05:42:11 --> 01:05:44:02
They have to leave their houses,

1120
01:05:44:02 --> 01:05:45:12
They just leave with their clothes and everything.

1121
01:05:45:12 --> 01:05:48:13
He left everything, how did they live? like this,

1122
01:05:48:17 --> 01:05:51:15
They lived like this, clearing the mountain

1123
01:05:51:15 --> 01:05:55:15
and they put some tents there and over time they built

1124
01:05:55:17 --> 01:05:57:07
He built his yotojoro (woody trunk of the cardon)

1125
01:05:57:07 --> 01:05:59:10
This is how the old people who lived told

1126
01:05:59:10 --> 01:06:00:10
about him

1127
01:06:00:10 --> 01:06:03:06
Jeepirachi, and

1128
01:06:03:06 --> 01:06:06:03
what they call ship and what they call I don't know what

1129
01:06:06:03 --> 01:06:07:23
and there they disappear

1130
01:06:07:23 --> 01:06:10:09
they. That

1131
01:06:10:09 --> 01:06:13:06
They are distant, they are ships

1132
01:06:13:06 --> 01:06:16:14
who come from afar, travelers on their cruise and

1133
01:06:16:14 --> 01:06:19:03
They all disappear,

1134
01:06:19:03 --> 01:06:19:16
the salt

1135
01:06:20:17 --> 01:06:22:06
sinks it

1136
01:06:22:06 --> 01:06:23:01
there near the

1137
01:06:23:01 --> 01:06:25:08
hill.

1138
01:06:37:15 --> 01:06:39:03
Well,

1139
01:06:39:03 --> 01:06:42:02
we do it to introduce you again,

1140
01:06:42:02 --> 01:06:45:02
just to make sure that we have

1141
01:06:45:05 --> 01:06:47:05
who are you and what do you do?

1142
01:06:47:05 --> 01:06:50:05
and where are you?

1143
01:06:50:12 --> 01:06:51:13
Who I am?

1144
01:06:51:13 --> 01:06:52:13
I am Romelia

1145
01:06:52:13 --> 01:06:55:02
Montiel

1146
01:06:55:02 --> 01:06:56:10
Oriana,

1147
01:06:56:10 --> 01:07:00:11
I am the ancestral knower of the Kayushipana community

1148
01:07:01:12 --> 01:07:02:09
AHA.

1149
01:07:02:09 --> 01:07:04:19
I am an artisan,

1150
01:07:04:19 --> 01:07:06:10
I am a teacher in all of them.

1151
01:07:06:10 --> 01:07:10:02
In crafts, in yonna, in recreations

1152
01:07:10:02 --> 01:07:11:01
and everything that has to do with it

1153
01:07:11:01 --> 01:07:13:07
with children and adults too,

1154
01:07:13:07 --> 01:07:14:09
Why not?

1155
01:07:14:09 --> 01:07:16:12
the one who wants to learn new things,

1156
01:07:16:12 --> 01:07:20:15
wants to learn to do things, he wants to exploit his

1157
01:07:20:20 --> 01:07:23:05
your mind

1158
01:07:23:05 --> 01:07:23:19
with regard

1159
01:07:23:19 --> 01:07:26:10
to culture.

1160
01:07:26:10 --> 01:07:29:23
And we are in the Uriana territory here in Uliana which is in Kayushipana

1161
01:07:32:21 --> 01:07:33:08
I

1162
01:07:33:08 --> 01:07:36:08
I am also a traditional doctor in this, me too

1163
01:07:36:09 --> 01:07:38:09
I do my ritual with the Majayülü

1164
01:07:53:05 --> 01:07:55:18
I wanted to know the importance

1165
01:07:55:18 --> 01:08:00:13
to pass knowledge to new generation to children

1166
01:08:01:16 --> 01:08:05:11
and I don't know how important that is to you.

1167
01:08:05:12 --> 01:08:06:02
and for…

1168
01:08:06:02 --> 01:08:07:15
Sure, it's so important.

1169
01:08:07:15 --> 01:08:09:06
I want someone like you

1170
01:08:09:06 --> 01:08:11:21
who knows more than us too, who

1171
01:08:11:21 --> 01:08:13:12
make a book,

1172
01:08:13:12 --> 01:08:15:08
It is a project towards all that,

1173
01:08:15:08 --> 01:08:17:03
to medicinal plants and everything,

1174
01:08:17:03 --> 01:08:19:08
and we help them and they get to have anything,

1175
01:08:19:08 --> 01:08:20:22
Any worry.

1176
01:08:20:22 --> 01:08:23:20
We help again with anything you want to know

1177
01:08:23:20 --> 01:08:25:17
if everything is

1178
01:08:25:17 --> 01:08:29:18
to deepen and unite more of the knowledge.

1179
01:08:30:17 --> 01:08:31:21
and for the children?

1180
01:08:31:21 --> 01:08:33:00
For children too

1181
01:08:33:00 --> 01:08:33:22
And it is possible

1182
01:08:33:22 --> 01:08:34:19
any project

1183
01:08:34:19 --> 01:08:37:05
what can be done with children also the yonna in which

1184
01:08:38:04 --> 01:08:39:07
we are part of that

1185
01:08:39:07 --> 01:08:41:04
Also, what happens is that we

1186
01:08:41:04 --> 01:08:42:16
because we lack resources

1187
01:08:42:16 --> 01:08:45:00
That's why we don't have the clothing for that,

1188
01:08:45:00 --> 01:08:48:05
because there's a siding over here and all that

1189
01:08:49:04 --> 01:08:51:12
What does it have to do with culture?

1190
01:08:51:12 --> 01:08:54:17
but we are low on resources, we don't have enough for that, that's why

1191
01:08:54:17 --> 01:08:58:16
We are left, but with three pieces of cloth we have we teach.

1192
01:09:00:14 --> 01:09:03:14
Because it is an interest.
