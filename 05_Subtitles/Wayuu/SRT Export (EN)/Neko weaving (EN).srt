1
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:06,333
What happens is that in La Guajira

2
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:09,041
plastic pollution is an issue

3
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:11,958
quite complex,

4
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:14,958
quite, quite serious.

5
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:19,083
Because one of the causes, to put it in a way,

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,833
for many decades

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
we have been buying

8
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:32,250
our food, an example would be rice,

9
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,750
That comes in a plastic wrapper,

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,666
The coffee comes in a plastic wrapper.

11
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,958
The spaghetti has plastic wrap.

12
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,833
Then buying that

13
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,916
here in the communities,

14
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:46,041
In rural areas, there is no sanitation system.

15
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,333
So the garbage truck doesn't pass here,

16
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,458
here the plastics that enter have no way out

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
so they stay in the communities

18
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:59,000
and that is why we say that this problem is cumulative.

19
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:03,833
We have been buying this plastic for many years.

20
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:07,791
and those plastics have remained in the communities

21
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:11,166
and that's why we have pollution

22
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,375
for waste

23
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:16,708
quite visible in the communities.

24
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,541
So,

25
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,791
This becomes a conflict

26
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:23,833
a problematic.

27
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,375
So serious that when we walked the trails

28
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:29,375
From the rancherías we are going to see plastics,

29
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:30,958
One goes for the cardones and

30
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,375
The cardons have plastic stuck.

31
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,875
One walks through the sea,

32
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:38,833
There is plastic on the beaches too, so now Manaure

33
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,083
is flooded.

34
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:43,375
To the extent that in 2019 Semana magazine,

35
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,333
a very popular magazine in Colombia published

36
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:50,833
an article titled La Güajira flooded with garbage.

37
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,791
And it is a phrase

38
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:57,291
that is not far from reality.

39
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,958
La Güajira really is flooded with plastics,

40
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:05,125
is flooded with waste and to

41
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,625
counteract this problem

42
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:14,041
We created this initiative ''Threads for Mma'' and

43
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:15,791
what we do is

44
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:19,750
bring workshops to communities,

45
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,958
to different communities, on awareness

46
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,500
facing the issue, the environmental issue

47
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,500
and how plastic,

48
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
How damaging is going to be when we leave it in nature.

49
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:38,333
These workshops are also

50
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:42,541
contextualized in our culture.

51
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,625
It's not just coming and saying

52
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,833
You have to classify them, classify solid waste

53
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,166
and so, but also to know

54
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,958
like our culture

55
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,875
has a thought regarding this topic.

56
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,583
And that's why, from that, ''Threads for Mmá '' was born,

57
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:06,041
where we bring workshops to the communities and also

58
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,125
we generate an exchange

59
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,291
where communities give us classified waste

60
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,375
and in return we give them threads,

61
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,375
we give them the wool to make

62
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,375
the backpacks, the

63
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
handles, the hammock.

64
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,125
This is how we give value to waste and communities

65
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,375
They say well, it's worth it

66
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:34,000
really, because there is a, there is an added value.

67
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,333
So they give us that waste,

68
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,833
We collect that waste,

69
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:42,708
There is a collection center here in the mountains, in the desert,

70
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:43,458
There is a collection there

71
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,125
and we take that waste

72
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,125
to the point of the urban area where it is

73
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,458
the garbage truck and all that.

74
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:56,291
And to also give continuity to these elements,

75
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,958
Like cardboard, we take it to recycling stores.

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,583
On the other hand,

77
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,291
the communities once they have the threads that we

78
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,291
We give to them, they make a product with that thread.

79
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,166
This is how we are focusing

80
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,166
in backpacks and accessories.

81
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,791
They make backpacks, for example, and

82
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,791
seeing that it is necessary to generate

83
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:25,708
a store where the results

84
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,625
of this exchange and this

85
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:31,000
barter we’re doing can be exposed: as well as

86
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,041
ensuring that this craftsman who made the product

87
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,791
receives a fair payment.

88
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,750
Because here in La Güajira

89
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,041
That is also another problem that artisans do not get paid well,

90
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,541
So the middleman always wins.

91
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,166
That's why we have a store where it is sold exclusively

92
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,833
everything that is the result of that exchange

93
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,166
and so

94
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,375
from the sale of a product

95
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,125
like the case of a backpack,

96
00:04:55,125 --> 00:05:01,333
a backpack gives us money to buy new

97
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,833
threads, new bags to work with communities

98
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,375
and so from a product it is what gives us,

99
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,083
It gives us money to fuel the entire process.

100
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:15,541
So the buyers, the people who

101
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,333
who find that product

102
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:23,208
we give you the opportunity wherever you are in the cities

103
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,500
that they can contribute something

104
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,500
in the end to the health of the planet.

105
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,250
If a person buys a product from us, from that

106
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,166
They are contributing to the environment.

107
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:37,708
In this case

108
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:38,916
to this part of Colombia,

109
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,458
trying to reduce pollution

110
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:45,000
and at the same time also generate that awareness about

111
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,541
of the crafts of indigenous groups, which do not

112
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,000
It's just an element

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,625
but behind a craft

114
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,250
There really is a story.

115
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,250
There was what I told you just now about Wale’kerü

116
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,208
and about how important this is

117
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,625
and about how in a craft there is a configuration,

118
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,250
there is ancestral knowledge,

119
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,500
then also generating that awareness for the buyer,

120
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:17,125
to the person to tell them not to buy just because it’s trendy,

121
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,625
do not buy to consume,

122
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:21,708
what is

123
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,750
the last thing we do now we just for consumption,

124
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,333
No, buy out of conscience that where I buy

125
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,791
from this that I am generating,

126
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,708
What impact am I generating?

127
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,666
So this product is very nice,

128
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:38,583
is being done in rural areas Manaure and

129
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,958
La Guajira and here where we are

130
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,375
where

131
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,375
as I was saying here now

132
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,583
it's an idea,

133
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,125
they don't even come in here

134
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:56,125
political entities or entities

135
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,958
who have responsibilities to look

136
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,000
How the communities are

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,916
So we are making a very cool impact.

138
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,625
and we hope that this work, which

139
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,625
This idea can be replicated in other contexts,

140
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,250
not only in our Wayuu culture,

141
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,500
but also in other brothers and indigenous people,

142
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,458
can somehow replicate this idea.

143
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,916
And we hope to continue growing.

144
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,625
We hope to help more Wayuu families,

145
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,625
We hope to help more communities through this.

146
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,333
and in the medium term,

147
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,458
or well, the end,

148
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:32,291
The goal of all this is also to one day say

149
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,000
see, look,

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,500
we contributed a bit

151
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
to the reduction of pollution in La Güajira.

152
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,166
That is our dream through that project.

153
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,958
And so well,

154
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,000
thanks

155
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
for making us a little bit visible

156
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,166
and well, to continue fighting in these processes,

157
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,916
in this case in La Güajira.

158
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,708
And what is the name of the project store?

159
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:01,875
we have the store

160
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:05,250
“Ishotot nos une” (ishototnosune username) that Ishotot has the word Isho,

161
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,041
which is blood,

162
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:10,833
then color of blood or blood unites us really

163
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:11,750
that is

164
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,458
Such that

165
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,416
a store created in the community,

166
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,041
We don't have an establishment yet.

167
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,666
physical, everything is virtual,

168
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,708
You can find us on different social networks

169
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,875
and we are there as Ishotot nos une and as Hilos por Mma.

170
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,208
These two sources can reach us.

171
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:32,166
Cool and how to summarize

172
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,666
the project in like a sentence of

173
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:40,083
as quickly as a summary of everything,

174
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,916
of the project idea.

175
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,708
Of course, yes.

176
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:53,375
From the purchase of a product

177
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,833
we generate impact,

178
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,416
a social impact and an impact…

179
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,750
two specific impacts,

180
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,333
an environmental impact and a social impact.

181
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,875
That's why, let's buy

182
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,458
or that the products

183
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,625
that we buy is a product that has a purpose

184
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,958
quite,

185
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,166
pretty good, both for

186
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,208
the artisan as well as for the planet.

187
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah.

188
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,666
Yes, do you collect, collect the plastic,

189
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,666
sell it and buy the thread?

190
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,666
Well let's say that the plastic here,

191
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:42,208
here in the communities the use of plastic,

192
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:46,166
here the communities they have them, they reuse them, so like this

193
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:50,500
for example, the pot, the one with the soda,

194
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:51,750
here it

195
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,000
reused to store oil, to store other liquids

196
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,500
and when this plastic material no longer has

197
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:02,375
one last use is that

198
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,250
they are free. No?

199
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,916
That's why when we collect all that material,

200
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:10,000
Most of them are already very very damaged materials,

201
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,583
Well, what we have to do is take it directly

202
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,583
to the sanitation point.

203
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,500
Other materials such as cardboard,

204
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,500
That one we do take it to the recycling stores,

205
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,666
They give it continuity and

206
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:27,333
we receive a coin in exchange for carrying that

207
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:31,458
There, but it is not our forte, really our forte

208
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,875
Is the product.

209
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,416
From the purchase of the product

210
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,166
is that it gives us money to buy more threads,

211
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,000
to buy more bags,

212
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,958
because we deliver

213
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,458
bags to the communities so that they can

214
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,666
collect waste. Our strong

215
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,666
It is in the product of craftsmanship.

216
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,708
Yes they pay us for the cardboard, for the plastics, but

217
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,708
It's not sufficient payment.

218
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,208
But we are very happy that with the store

219
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,208
It gives that continuity, they give it a use.

220
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,208
Yes.

221
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,833
Well, is there anything else you want to tell about knitting or

222
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,041
from this site

223
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,041
or what we have seen today.

224
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,833
Something else I could tell

225
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,250
would it be necessary

226
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,958
change the perspective of

227
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,375
how to see communities and how

228
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,541
futures should be made

229
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,125
projects with communities.

230
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,125
There are many projects

231
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,458
of the government, let's put it this way,

232
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,000
But mostly those projects fail.

233
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,291
because it is not being done or is not working

234
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,333
the communities. In this case we with ''Hilos por Mma''

235
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,041
We saw the need to create that store,

236
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,041
because at the beginning

237
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,041
the products,

238
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:02,333
The crafts that came out were sold to the local market

239
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,708
and there he did not receive a fair payment.

240
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:09,208
So it is always thinking about the entire process, about each thing,

241
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,708
If I give this, where will it end?
