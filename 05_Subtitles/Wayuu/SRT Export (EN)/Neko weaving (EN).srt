1
00:00:03:16 --> 00:00:06:08
What happens is that in La Guajira

2
00:00:06:08 --> 00:00:09:01
plastic pollution is an issue

3
00:00:09:01 --> 00:00:11:23
quite complex,

4
00:00:11:23 --> 00:00:14:23
quite, quite serious.

5
00:00:15:15 --> 00:00:19:02
Because one of the causes, to put it in a way,

6
00:00:20:18 --> 00:00:23:20
for many decades

7
00:00:24:12 --> 00:00:27:12
we have been buying

8
00:00:29:03 --> 00:00:32:06
our food, an example would be rice,

9
00:00:32:13 --> 00:00:34:18
That comes in a plastic wrapper,

10
00:00:34:18 --> 00:00:36:16
The coffee comes in a plastic wrapper.

11
00:00:36:16 --> 00:00:38:23
The spaghetti has plastic wrap.

12
00:00:38:23 --> 00:00:41:19
Then buying that

13
00:00:41:19 --> 00:00:42:21
here in the communities,

14
00:00:42:21 --> 00:00:46:00
In rural areas, there is no sanitation system.

15
00:00:46:19 --> 00:00:49:07
So the garbage truck doesn't pass here,

16
00:00:49:07 --> 00:00:52:10
here the plastics that enter have no way out

17
00:00:52:11 --> 00:00:55:11
so they stay in the communities

18
00:00:55:18 --> 00:00:58:23
and that is why we say that this problem is cumulative.

19
00:00:59:07 --> 00:01:03:19
We have been buying this plastic for many years.

20
00:01:04:18 --> 00:01:07:18
and those plastics have remained in the communities

21
00:01:08:04 --> 00:01:11:03
and that's why we have pollution

22
00:01:12:05 --> 00:01:13:08
for waste

23
00:01:13:08 --> 00:01:16:16
quite visible in the communities.

24
00:01:16:20 --> 00:01:18:12
So,

25
00:01:18:12 --> 00:01:20:18
This becomes a conflict

26
00:01:20:18 --> 00:01:23:18
a problematic.

27
00:01:23:23 --> 00:01:26:07
So serious that when we walked the trails

28
00:01:26:07 --> 00:01:29:07
From the rancherías we are going to see plastics,

29
00:01:30:06 --> 00:01:30:21
One goes for the cardones and

30
00:01:30:21 --> 00:01:33:07
The cardons have plastic stuck.

31
00:01:33:07 --> 00:01:35:19
One walks through the sea,

32
00:01:35:19 --> 00:01:38:18
There is plastic on the beaches too, so now Manaure

33
00:01:38:18 --> 00:01:40:00
is flooded.

34
00:01:40:00 --> 00:01:43:07
To the extent that in 2019 Semana magazine,

35
00:01:43:07 --> 00:01:46:06
a very popular magazine in Colombia published

36
00:01:46:11 --> 00:01:50:18
an article titled La Güajira flooded with garbage.

37
00:01:51:20 --> 00:01:54:17
And it is a phrase

38
00:01:54:17 --> 00:01:57:05
that is not far from reality.

39
00:01:57:05 --> 00:01:59:21
La Güajira really is flooded with plastics,

40
00:01:59:21 --> 00:02:05:00
is flooded with waste and to

41
00:02:05:12 --> 00:02:08:12
counteract this problem

42
00:02:09:04 --> 00:02:13:22
We created this initiative ''Threads for Mma'' and

43
00:02:14:12 --> 00:02:15:16
what we do is

44
00:02:16:19 --> 00:02:19:15
bring workshops to communities,

45
00:02:19:15 --> 00:02:23:20
to different communities, on awareness

46
00:02:24:01 --> 00:02:27:09
facing the issue, the environmental issue

47
00:02:27:22 --> 00:02:30:09
and how plastic,

48
00:02:30:09 --> 00:02:33:09
How damaging is going to be when we leave it in nature.

49
00:02:34:22 --> 00:02:38:05
These workshops are also

50
00:02:38:22 --> 00:02:42:10
contextualized in our culture.

51
00:02:42:18 --> 00:02:45:12
It's not just coming and saying

52
00:02:45:12 --> 00:02:48:16
You have to classify them, classify solid waste

53
00:02:49:11 --> 00:02:52:00
and so, but also to know

54
00:02:52:00 --> 00:02:54:19
like our culture

55
00:02:54:19 --> 00:02:58:17
has a thought regarding this topic.

56
00:02:59:10 --> 00:03:02:10
And that's why, from that, ''Threads for Mmá '' was born,

57
00:03:02:16 --> 00:03:05:21
where we bring workshops to the communities and also

58
00:03:07:12 --> 00:03:09:23
we generate an exchange

59
00:03:09:23 --> 00:03:13:03
where communities give us classified waste

60
00:03:13:03 --> 00:03:15:05
and in return we give them threads,

61
00:03:15:05 --> 00:03:18:05
we give them the wool to make

62
00:03:18:05 --> 00:03:21:05
the backpacks, the

63
00:03:22:08 --> 00:03:24:08
handles, the hammock.

64
00:03:24:08 --> 00:03:28:22
This is how we give value to waste and communities

65
00:03:28:22 --> 00:03:30:04
They say well, it's worth it

66
00:03:30:04 --> 00:03:33:19
really, because there is a, there is an added value.

67
00:03:34:02 --> 00:03:36:03
So they give us that waste,

68
00:03:36:03 --> 00:03:38:15
We collect that waste,

69
00:03:38:15 --> 00:03:42:12
There is a collection center here in the mountains, in the desert,

70
00:03:42:12 --> 00:03:43:06
There is a collection there

71
00:03:44:06 --> 00:03:45:22
and we take that waste

72
00:03:45:22 --> 00:03:48:22
to the point of the urban area where it is

73
00:03:49:20 --> 00:03:52:06
the garbage truck and all that.

74
00:03:52:06 --> 00:03:56:02
And to also give continuity to these elements,

75
00:03:56:02 --> 00:03:59:18
Like cardboard, we take it to recycling stores.

76
00:04:00:19 --> 00:04:02:09
On the other hand,

77
00:04:02:09 --> 00:04:05:02
the communities once they have the threads that we

78
00:04:05:02 --> 00:04:08:02
We give to them, they make a product with that thread.

79
00:04:09:08 --> 00:04:10:22
This is how we are focusing

80
00:04:10:22 --> 00:04:13:22
in backpacks and accessories.

81
00:04:13:22 --> 00:04:17:13
They make backpacks, for example, and

82
00:04:17:13 --> 00:04:20:13
seeing that it is necessary to generate

83
00:04:21:07 --> 00:04:25:11
a store where the results

84
00:04:25:11 --> 00:04:26:09
of this exchange and this

85
00:04:26:09 --> 00:04:30:18
barter we’re doing can be exposed: as well as

86
00:04:31:05 --> 00:04:33:19
ensuring that this craftsman who made the product

87
00:04:33:19 --> 00:04:35:13
receives a fair payment.

88
00:04:35:13 --> 00:04:36:12
Because here in La Güajira

89
00:04:36:12 --> 00:04:39:19
That is also another problem that artisans do not get paid well,

90
00:04:40:07 --> 00:04:43:07
So the middleman always wins.

91
00:04:43:09 --> 00:04:45:22
That's why we have a store where it is sold exclusively

92
00:04:45:22 --> 00:04:48:14
everything that is the result of that exchange

93
00:04:49:13 --> 00:04:50:22
and so

94
00:04:50:22 --> 00:04:53:02
from the sale of a product

95
00:04:53:02 --> 00:04:54:20
like the case of a backpack,

96
00:04:54:20 --> 00:05:01:01
a backpack gives us money to buy new

97
00:05:01:01 --> 00:05:04:13
threads, new bags to work with communities

98
00:05:05:02 --> 00:05:08:02
and so from a product it is what gives us,

99
00:05:09:02 --> 00:05:11:19
It gives us money to fuel the entire process.

100
00:05:11:19 --> 00:05:15:06
So the buyers, the people who

101
00:05:16:01 --> 00:05:19:01
who find that product

102
00:05:19:14 --> 00:05:22:22
we give you the opportunity wherever you are in the cities

103
00:05:23:08 --> 00:05:26:05
that they can contribute something

104
00:05:26:05 --> 00:05:30:05
in the end to the health of the planet.

105
00:05:30:22 --> 00:05:33:22
If a person buys a product from us, from that

106
00:05:34:01 --> 00:05:36:20
They are contributing to the environment.

107
00:05:36:20 --> 00:05:37:09
In this case

108
00:05:37:09 --> 00:05:38:14
to this part of Colombia,

109
00:05:38:14 --> 00:05:41:03
trying to reduce pollution

110
00:05:41:03 --> 00:05:44:16
and at the same time also generate that awareness about

111
00:05:45:10 --> 00:05:50:05
of the crafts of indigenous groups, which do not

112
00:05:52:17 --> 00:05:54:16
It's just an element

113
00:05:54:16 --> 00:05:56:07
but behind a craft

114
00:05:56:07 --> 00:05:57:22
There really is a story.

115
00:05:57:22 --> 00:06:00:22
There was what I told you just now about Wale’kerü

116
00:06:01:12 --> 00:06:03:21
and about how important this is

117
00:06:03:21 --> 00:06:07:07
and about how in a craft there is a configuration,

118
00:06:07:23 --> 00:06:09:22
there is ancestral knowledge,

119
00:06:09:22 --> 00:06:13:04
then also generating that awareness for the buyer,

120
00:06:13:08 --> 00:06:16:18
to the person to tell them not to buy just because it’s trendy,

121
00:06:17:02 --> 00:06:20:06
do not buy to consume,

122
00:06:20:10 --> 00:06:21:08
what is

123
00:06:21:08 --> 00:06:23:09
the last thing we do now we just for consumption,

124
00:06:23:09 --> 00:06:26:23
No, buy out of conscience that where I buy

125
00:06:27:11 --> 00:06:29:10
from this that I am generating,

126
00:06:29:10 --> 00:06:31:08
What impact am I generating?

127
00:06:31:08 --> 00:06:34:07
So this product is very nice,

128
00:06:34:13 --> 00:06:38:05
is being done in rural areas Manaure and

129
00:06:38:05 --> 00:06:41:14
La Guajira and here where we are

130
00:06:43:02 --> 00:06:45:00
where

131
00:06:45:00 --> 00:06:48:00
as I was saying here now

132
00:06:48:14 --> 00:06:50:05
it's an idea,

133
00:06:51:08 --> 00:06:52:18
they don't even come in here

134
00:06:52:18 --> 00:06:55:18
political entities or entities

135
00:06:56:23 --> 00:06:58:13
who have responsibilities to look

136
00:06:58:13 --> 00:07:00:14
How the communities are

137
00:07:00:14 --> 00:07:02:12
So we are making a very cool impact.

138
00:07:02:12 --> 00:07:04:05
and we hope that this work, which

139
00:07:04:05 --> 00:07:07:05
This idea can be replicated in other contexts,

140
00:07:07:12 --> 00:07:09:20
not only in our Wayuu culture,

141
00:07:09:20 --> 00:07:13:02
but also in other brothers and indigenous people,

142
00:07:13:02 --> 00:07:16:01
can somehow replicate this idea.

143
00:07:16:04 --> 00:07:18:12
And we hope to continue growing.

144
00:07:18:12 --> 00:07:21:05
We hope to help more Wayuu families,

145
00:07:21:05 --> 00:07:24:05
We hope to help more communities through this.

146
00:07:24:09 --> 00:07:26:22
and in the medium term,

147
00:07:26:22 --> 00:07:28:01
or well, the end,

148
00:07:28:01 --> 00:07:31:21
The goal of all this is also to one day say

149
00:07:31:21 --> 00:07:32:14
see, look,

150
00:07:32:14 --> 00:07:34:02
we contributed a bit

151
00:07:34:02 --> 00:07:37:02
to the reduction of pollution in La Güajira.

152
00:07:37:02 --> 00:07:40:17
That is our dream through that project.

153
00:07:41:12 --> 00:07:43:12
And so well,

154
00:07:43:12 --> 00:07:45:13
thanks

155
00:07:45:13 --> 00:07:48:13
for making us a little bit visible

156
00:07:50:07 --> 00:07:54:17
and well, to continue fighting in these processes,

157
00:07:55:19 --> 00:07:57:11
in this case in La Güajira.

158
00:07:57:11 --> 00:08:00:06
And what is the name of the project store?

159
00:08:00:06 --> 00:08:01:10
we have the store

160
00:08:01:10 --> 00:08:04:19
“Ishotot nos une” (ishototnosune username) that Ishotot has the word Isho,

161
00:08:05:09 --> 00:08:06:14
which is blood,

162
00:08:06:14 --> 00:08:10:09
then color of blood or blood unites us really

163
00:08:11:01 --> 00:08:11:07
that is

164
00:08:11:07 --> 00:08:13:00
Such that

165
00:08:13:00 --> 00:08:14:23
a store created in the community,

166
00:08:14:23 --> 00:08:16:14
We don't have an establishment yet.

167
00:08:16:14 --> 00:08:18:05
physical, everything is virtual,

168
00:08:18:05 --> 00:08:21:05
You can find us on different social networks

169
00:08:21:09 --> 00:08:24:09
and we are there as Ishotot nos une and as Hilos por Mma.

170
00:08:24:09 --> 00:08:27:17
These two sources can reach us.

171
00:08:28:16 --> 00:08:31:16
Cool and how to summarize

172
00:08:32:03 --> 00:08:35:04
the project in like a sentence of

173
00:08:36:01 --> 00:08:39:14
as quickly as a summary of everything,

174
00:08:40:10 --> 00:08:43:10
of the project idea.

175
00:08:45:05 --> 00:08:48:05
Of course, yes.

176
00:08:49:09 --> 00:08:52:21
From the purchase of a product

177
00:08:55:08 --> 00:08:58:08
we generate impact,

178
00:08:58:23 --> 00:09:00:22
a social impact and an impact…

179
00:09:00:22 --> 00:09:03:05
two specific impacts,

180
00:09:03:05 --> 00:09:05:19
an environmental impact and a social impact.

181
00:09:05:19 --> 00:09:08:08
That's why, let's buy

182
00:09:08:08 --> 00:09:10:22
or that the products

183
00:09:10:22 --> 00:09:14:02
that we buy is a product that has a purpose

184
00:09:15:10 --> 00:09:18:10
quite,

185
00:09:19:15 --> 00:09:22:15
pretty good, both for

186
00:09:22:16 --> 00:09:25:16
the artisan as well as for the planet.

187
00:09:26:14 --> 00:09:27:11
Yeah.

188
00:09:27:11 --> 00:09:31:03
Yes, do you collect, collect the plastic,

189
00:09:31:03 --> 00:09:34:03
sell it and buy the thread?

190
00:09:35:03 --> 00:09:38:03
Well let's say that the plastic here,

191
00:09:38:06 --> 00:09:41:16
here in the communities the use of plastic,

192
00:09:41:16 --> 00:09:45:14
here the communities they have them, they reuse them, so like this

193
00:09:45:14 --> 00:09:49:22
for example, the pot, the one with the soda,

194
00:09:50:15 --> 00:09:51:04
here it

195
00:09:51:04 --> 00:09:54:10
reused to store oil, to store other liquids

196
00:09:54:19 --> 00:09:57:22
and when this plastic material no longer has

197
00:09:58:19 --> 00:10:01:19
one last use is that

198
00:10:02:02 --> 00:10:03:16
they are free. No?

199
00:10:03:16 --> 00:10:06:08
That's why when we collect all that material,

200
00:10:06:08 --> 00:10:09:10
Most of them are already very very damaged materials,

201
00:10:10:00 --> 00:10:13:00
Well, what we have to do is take it directly

202
00:10:13:07 --> 00:10:15:00
to the sanitation point.

203
00:10:15:00 --> 00:10:16:22
Other materials such as cardboard,

204
00:10:16:22 --> 00:10:19:22
That one we do take it to the recycling stores,

205
00:10:20:12 --> 00:10:23:02
They give it continuity and

206
00:10:23:02 --> 00:10:26:17
we receive a coin in exchange for carrying that

207
00:10:26:17 --> 00:10:30:20
There, but it is not our forte, really our forte

208
00:10:30:20 --> 00:10:32:06
Is the product.

209
00:10:32:06 --> 00:10:33:19
From the purchase of the product

210
00:10:33:19 --> 00:10:36:13
is that it gives us money to buy more threads,

211
00:10:36:13 --> 00:10:38:09
to buy more bags,

212
00:10:38:09 --> 00:10:39:08
because we deliver

213
00:10:39:08 --> 00:10:40:20
bags to the communities so that they can

214
00:10:43:07 --> 00:10:46:01
collect waste. Our strong

215
00:10:46:01 --> 00:10:49:01
It is in the product of craftsmanship.

216
00:10:49:09 --> 00:10:53:02
Yes they pay us for the cardboard, for the plastics, but

217
00:10:53:02 --> 00:10:56:02
It's not sufficient payment.

218
00:10:56:02 --> 00:10:58:14
But we are very happy that with the store

219
00:10:58:14 --> 00:11:01:14
It gives that continuity, they give it a use.

220
00:11:02:14 --> 00:11:03:14
Yes.

221
00:11:03:14 --> 00:11:07:04
Well, is there anything else you want to tell about knitting or

222
00:11:08:09 --> 00:11:10:09
from this site

223
00:11:10:09 --> 00:11:13:09
or what we have seen today.

224
00:11:14:04 --> 00:11:17:04
Something else I could tell

225
00:11:19:15 --> 00:11:21:14
would it be necessary

226
00:11:21:14 --> 00:11:25:07
change the perspective of

227
00:11:25:08 --> 00:11:28:17
how to see communities and how

228
00:11:28:21 --> 00:11:31:21
futures should be made

229
00:11:32:21 --> 00:11:34:11
projects with communities.

230
00:11:34:11 --> 00:11:37:11
There are many projects

231
00:11:38:09 --> 00:11:40:19
of the government, let's put it this way,

232
00:11:40:19 --> 00:11:43:08
But mostly those projects fail.

233
00:11:43:08 --> 00:11:45:15
because it is not being done or is not working

234
00:11:45:15 --> 00:11:48:15
the communities. In this case we with ''Hilos por Mma''

235
00:11:49:17 --> 00:11:52:08
We saw the need to create that store,

236
00:11:52:08 --> 00:11:55:08
because at the beginning

237
00:11:55:15 --> 00:11:58:08
the products,

238
00:11:58:08 --> 00:12:01:15
The crafts that came out were sold to the local market

239
00:12:02:04 --> 00:12:04:00
and there he did not receive a fair payment.

240
00:12:04:00 --> 00:12:08:12
So it is always thinking about the entire process, about each thing,

241
00:12:09:18 --> 00:12:12:00
If I give this, where will it end?
