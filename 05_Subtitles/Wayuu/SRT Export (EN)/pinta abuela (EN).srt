1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Regarding what we were talking about in the kitchen now

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What is what women do to their faces ?

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The Acheepa? (wayuu makeup)

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes, they say there is one for the sun

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That for skin rejuvenation

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that one I did

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Wayuu makeup is for the yonna (dance)

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the one i did

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Before, according to the tales, did the makeup began
for a dream?

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes of course, dreams were the origin of that

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The piachi (spiritualist) said what to do based on the dream

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Whether it's for Yonna or for family flags, that's part
of the stories too

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Now, if we are treating someone,
we lock them up and perform a ritual

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It has a price, something good as a
reward for the work done

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Well that's mostly for the people who want it

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, as I was saying, the dream asks for it
sometimes to heal a child of some disease

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If it is to heal a child, draw a
semi spiral in his hands

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Although to make it effective a ritual
must be done to heal completely

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And does makeup serve as a sunscreen?

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes, when looking for water it is applied in
the whole face, also for walking

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
that's the makeup
of women to go out

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
How is the makeup done?

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The suet of a small sheep is cooked or fried
and white, they stir it until it is thick,

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Then they apply it together with the pali´isa (a type of red chalk) on the face leaving only their eyes uncovered

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Can you tell us a little more about the pali´isa?

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Wayuu makeup is for the yonna, instead the other

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What I was telling you, it's more spiritual
which is usually requested through a dream.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The acheepa has been something very ancestral by our grandparents,

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But, it has endured thanks to the new generation

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's what our old folks say

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Today there are many forms of makeup
as well as different figures

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
figures such as family symbols, the spiral among others.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Can you tell us a little more about that?

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Those figures in the days before were just
on the cheek separately

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Little by little they were shaped in the face.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
There are many figures not seen now

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Those that were not transmitted by stories

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
that about the symbols, what does that mean in life?

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The last question I asked you about the symbols,
You can graph what you want to put

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That is

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Makeup has an origin in dreams earlier.

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
They were made because sometimes they said that they should put that on the girl,
So that she does not get sick or so that the virus that is going to come does not touch her

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Because the material it has, red represents blood

45
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This was for the spirits so they don’t,

46
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
They move away, no? in ancient times I mean, now they are used in celebrations
And for the celebration and things like that

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and what is the color made of?

48
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
you already asked

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That is a plant that is macerated

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And that plant has that tone

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and where do you get it from?

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What they are asking is where does the pali´isa (red chalk) come from ?

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Where do they get it from to obtain that red

54
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
To obtain it, you search among the mountains

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There isn't here because it has a specific area
Around the mountains

56
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
To prepare it and make it the shape of a bun

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The one that does it,

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Has to knead it and shape it to make it look like that

59
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This plant has its leaves too

60
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The leaves are used for thirst, it is cooked and drunk.

61
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And that pali´isa (red chalk) Is it given to the ladies?

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Of course, it is given to the ladies to drink

63
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So that they are beautiful with a firm body

64
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:45,000
After childbirth they are also given and can have
Up to five children, they also drink it then

65
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The red chalk helps not only the ladies but all of them,
Plans the pregnancy too

66
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
with what?, with the leaves of pali´isa

67
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
you recorded that last one

68
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
it's good? Very good contribution

69
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
She spoke about the makeup that is used, it is not only for
Makeup for various things.

70
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And why do only women wear that?
why not men

71
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He says why the makeup?

72
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Or the figures, can't men wear them ?

73
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It is applied to the one who is going to dance

74
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Everyone has their acheepa (makeup) in the yonna

75
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And when they are on the piyoi (dance floor)
The man shouts jou'se (come!)

76
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's how it's done the dance

77
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Can you repeat what you said about makeup?
of the man

78
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
the what?, the acheepa

79
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The man is painted when it’s time to dance,
Figures are also put on him as well

80
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
She explained it, she clarified that it is not limited
even women only

81
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And where do they learn all this from?

82
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
the question is who teaches this in the community?

83
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
How do they learn?

84
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
the fact that? to learn that

85
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
This? Yes, you know that not everyone knows about the acheepa

86
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I know it because I have the knowledge of the piachi (spiritualist)
I don't know it just for the sake of knowing

87
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I can make a person let go of hatred or resentment

88
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Because I am a piachi (spiritualist)

89
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It seemed that you were giving the blessing
To women when she did that

90
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
if I asked her

91
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
She just made it clear that not everyone
You can do that, which are gifts

92
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
She has the gift of being able to see, what was I telling you right now,
The eye, right? Yeah.

93
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000
She can read people, so that's a gift too.
for makeup

94
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The make-up thing is original
Because now everyone paints

95
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But mostly they are similar, so which one
is the question you are going to ask

96
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I could say your name and what do you do?

97
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm going to ask the question that you said first

98
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
If you bless women as you say

99
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,000
He asks about the figures
that did you draw on the girls

100
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You were talking and he asks what was
you told them while you painted them

101
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That is, what did you tell them when painting them?

102
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What I said to them at the time of painting them
it was that he was putting the pali´isa to them to dance

103
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I told them that I was putting makeup on them so that
they show the ancestral steps of our yonna

104
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I also told them that I was putting them makeup on them so
They have fun, to play

105
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's how it is

106
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Ok, you have answers

107
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And what's her name? where is she from?

108
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He says say your name where are you from? you stand out
that you are wayúu because they know several ethnic groups

109
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Of course I'm wayuu, I'm not an imitation or something like that

110
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And my name is Catalina Epieyu

111
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
A pleasure, thank you very much

112
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Did you get it? Yes Yes.

113
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What else? she just said her name and her clan

114
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
He just told you about the job right now
with the eye right now

115
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Although that's a lengthy explanation as well,
But I think that she can explain a little
more of that gift I don't know what you think

116
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yes, that and also its connection with nature

117
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Ok, there were two questions, right?

118
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
A while ago you mentioned that you were a piache (spiritualists)

119
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
In our territory, not everyone can be a piache, right? Yeah

120
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
How is a piachi formed according to ancient tales?

121
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
In order to receive the gift?

122
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes of course.
that is because of a dream, the dream tells you that you are going to have that gift

123
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
start to see beyond

124
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If you see a sick girl, your good eye tells you what to do

125
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
He says " look for a jawapia (medicinal plant) for that girl
so that “the evil eye” she has goes away”

126
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The same if it is for a confinement or for something else,
this is more or less how the gift works

127
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The thing about the arijunas is something else

128
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I have heard a tale that says there is a dream for
the spirits to arrive

129
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Someone from Manaure told me that in her dream

130
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
a person came to her when they are ladies

131
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What did that dream allow you to have that gift?

132
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It allows me to see spirits

133
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
As the spirit gets closer
I see it well, but when it is very close I stop seeing it

134
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The spirits of a spiritualist are in the afterlife
that's why they see everything

135
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Spirits do not wander on Earth like those
of the dead, as that is something very different

136
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yes it is correct, another question to finish

137
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
He has just explained to you how the gift is obtained,
Which is through dreams

138
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
When they are young ladies they have a dream where they see a giant character facing them

139
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But that character does not speak to them, but when
is very close to them they disappear

140
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So that's the spirit with which they walk now

141
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Ok, to end the interview

142
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What he wants to know is regarding the
connection with nature

143
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Everything we know has a spiritual connotation

144
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
For example, if a person moves, they must sacrifice
an animal to shed its blood

145
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It has a spiritual connotation, but at the same time
has a dark spiritual connotation

146
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
When a person arrives in a new territory, they must
have food coffee drinks etc.

147
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
If you don't do it, a child will die, because with the ritual it is
As if you buy your stay in the territory somehow

148
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What else does the spiritual imply?

149
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Everything has a spiritual connotation, as well as that of
defy god

150
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
If the ritual is not done, the price may be the
son they love the most

151
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And the animals?

152
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It affects their animals because by not doing the ritual they
they fade away little by little

153
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
They can even have cows, even so, they will run out of animals for not asking the permission of the land through the ritual

4:33 p.m. 4:34 p.m.
And with the water?

154
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It is also the same if the child of that person reaches out
for water in the well, the child can fall into it

155
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The spirit makes them fall into the well when it makes them lean over to fall to the bottom and drowns them

156
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You just talked about nature itself being a living being

157
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
A clear example is when a person goes to
move to another place

158
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
When you are going to move, you must
shed the goat's blood

159
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's like an acceptance of nature in that locality

160
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
If you arrive without killing the goat, you will not be well accepted.

161
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's why it was very important that we cook
goat today as an acceptance

162
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Because that way, things go well for us, and because the spirits, according to the evangelical belief, are pleased

163
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Then she mentioned constantly that all nature
both the water, the vegetation even the goats
there is a being that takes care of them there

164
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:52,000
If we mistreat these animals, they are going to leave us, they are not going to produce, that is why it is necessary to caress them, we have to talk to them

165
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's why she says we respect that connection, if
I have that connection I understand nature

166
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I don't know what we are going to ask her now

167
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Ask her how she relates to the wind

168
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,000
As there is a lot of wind now, I don't know if it's something
that should you ask

169
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It got lost. it got lost? No, I want to explore the land

170
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
to understand the culture

171
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
See how things are with the arrival of your visitors

172
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You see how things are, he did not leave just because, some spirit from those around us unconsciously called him to take him away

173
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
If there were no evil spirit among us,
he wouldn't have left like that on his own

174
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He would have asked or asked for the company of some of the
boys to take him where he was going

175
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You see how each thing has its connotation, that's why
must make a good harmonization with food today

176
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So that it does not affect the life of a child here

177
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
There are a lot of evil spirits right now and it knows what's going on

178
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:22,000
To definitely wrap up,

179
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:34,000
We already spoke about the water and its spirits,
as well as our Juya (rain) our father

180
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
We also talk about dreams and their meaning

181
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
However, there is something that is rarely talked about and it is
regarding the wind

182
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Because if we ask a village elder
about the wind, he does not know the answer

183
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It is something that is commonly unknown

184
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And I was wondering if you could share something about the wind

185
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
If a person dreams of the wind, it is because they’re
going to be hit by a car

186
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What he asks is regarding the history of the wind in ancient times.

187
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,000
He was a strong mythological being who climbed
up to the sky in a swirl

188
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
The whirlpool is formed from the earth in a circle and
slowly ascending to the sky

189
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
If you could see one now you would realize that
he forms from the earth to vanish in the sky

190
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:42,000
If the wind is always among us and even gives
signs of when someone is their chosen one

191
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
If he liked a woman a lot, he
manifests through the swirl

192
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
He is very good at picking people

193
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
They have something, not deeply from the wind, but if something
from the dream, what meaning does the wind have in the dream

194
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Can you talk a bit about the footprints? That you are very good at finding tracks

195
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's because of the herding, we are very good at herding

196
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Being a woman in Wayuu society, the importance
That it has, How does that work here?

197
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
The importance of women? Yeah

198
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
can you talk to us a bit

199
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
On the social organization of the Wayúu

200
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Can you tell us a bit about that?

201
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Our children that are women, they are our family

202
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Instead, the sons of the men are belong to
another family (mother's). That's how it is

203
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Why are women important for the future?

204
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Women are important and necessary because
they are the ones that are going to keep that learning

205
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:50,000
They are the ones who are going to share everything about culture,
They are the ones that will preserve what we are

206
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
They are going to make our culture continue when we are no longer here.

207
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So you don't get lost, of course.

208
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
yes, she mentioned how important and how is our matrilineal structure

209
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And how is that presented on a day-to-day basis?

210
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
More than anything it is how we live that tradition

211
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
That is why I also clarify it a lot, the maternal line

212
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
She said, the one who has rights over the children is the woman

213
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Because the paternal does not have as much involvement

214
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
We also saw red a lot. How important is it?
that for culture? for the women?

215
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,000
The dance too, if you can explain the yonna dance

216
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
They are very curious about the yonna when
they saw the children dance

217
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Can you tell us what is the yonna? And why is
dance in a circle

218
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And why did the sky dance backwards?

219
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So it should be, that is their position since ancient times

220
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But tell us a little more

221
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Since ancient times it has been transmitted like this,
he must face the woman during the dance

222
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Likewise, the woman goes straight ahead, that's why she avoids him,
or they cross paths to make him take more turns seeking her, making him tired

223
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It is known that several steps are shown in the yonna
Can you talk to us about that?

224
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yes, there are several steps, for example the horse race

225
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
If a girl stands out in that step, her makeup goes
according to that

226
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And when they see her, they immediately recognize her by her ability.
in that step because each one has a specialty

227
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
The pace of the horse race is very traditional,
although not very common

228
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Today they are taking it up again

229
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Because that step was taken from horse racing
and they played with imitating it

230
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
By imitating it they adopted it at the dance

231
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
That's right, well she just talked about the yonna, about
tradition, bordering on the concept of the circle

232
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,000
ok ma'am thank you

233
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Thank you for talking about our culture

234
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
What was recorded so it stays later for the children

235
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
So that when you are not here, they can say that they have at least the recording of their grandmother's words

236
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Because the words are there, but, they can be
forgotten too

237
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Of course, because nobody saves them and that is why they are forgotten

238
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Yes, but now it is recorded on the camera and that
you will see it later

239
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Yes, the children become Westernized, at least one of
Takes an interest in culture

240
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And if they wonder how our culture was like, they
Surely can find an answer in the recording

241
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yes, surely in the future children will wonder about
the stories and tales that you’re sharing with us

242
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Yes, because today's children do not follow
the teaching of our elders

243
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yes, it is true, see that there are no children in si'ira anymore
(wayúu weaving) and these are very necessary to keep us

244
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
The kou'su (wayúu footwear) is no longer used now either

245
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
that was our identity

246
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
She just spoke about the importance of preserving and preserving identity.

247
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Maybe a message you want to take to the world

248
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Kids these days

249
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
They don't own their culture as much as before

250
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:05,000
In the past people respected each other, they lived in peace and harmony

251
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Nowadays nephews want to hit their uncles

252
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
No respect even for older brothers

253
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It is the same with women, they no longer respect
their older brothers

254
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
We ourselves have affected our culture

255
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:32,000
If they asked you what your message would be to talk and
strengthen our culture? what would you say

256
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It is what they want to hear, to know how to reaffirm
what we are as wayuu

257
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Because even the Wayúu youth of today
devalue our culture

258
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Before, young people respected their uncles

259
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
If an uncle caught his nephew's attention,
he was silent and listened

260
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:20,000
He waited for their uncle to finish talking and didn't answer him

261
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Today's young kids, like you, don't like
being called out and wish harm upon their mothers

262
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Today's children and young people must highlight
the role of their uncle when they are in a conflict

263
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,000
But that depends on us mothers, we must
enhance those values and principles

264
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Although they do not value our teachings

265
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And I know why I'm saying because I see it, I don't say it just because

266
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Well, more than a message for the world is a message for the culture itself

267
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
We need to return to the times of the past

268
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Where respect was the main value of culture

269
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
In these moments we have already lost our children, they do not want to respect us

270
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Our uncles are already disrespecting each other

271
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Then it is to return to teach the new generations, that we return to be Wayúu in humanity.

272
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Thank you

273
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Thank you very much he says.
