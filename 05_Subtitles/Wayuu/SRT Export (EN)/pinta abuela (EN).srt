1
00:11 --> 00:15
Regarding what we were talking about in the kitchen now

2
00:16 --> 00:19
What is what women do to their faces ?

3
00:20 --> 00:22
The Acheepa? (wayuu makeup)

4
00:23 --> 00:25
Yes, they say there is one for the sun

5
00:26 --> 00:33
That for skin rejuvenation

6
00:34 --> 00:35
that one I did

7
00:36 --> 00:40
Wayuu makeup is for the yonna (dance)

8
00:43 --> 00:45
the one i did

9
00:46 --> 00:47
Now

10
00:48 --> 00:54
Before, according to the tales, did the makeup began
for a dream?

11
00:55 --> 01:03
Yes of course, dreams were the origin of that

12
01:04 --> 01:08
The piachi (spiritualist) said what to do based on the dream

13
01:09 --> 01:16
Whether it's for Yonna or for family flags, that's part
of the stories too

14
01:17 --> 01:24
Now, if we are treating someone,
we lock them up and perform a ritual

15
01:25 --> 01:31
It has a price, something good as a
reward for the work done

16
01:33 --> 01:37
Well that's mostly for the people who want it

17
01:38 --> 01:46
Well, as I was saying, the dream asks for it
sometimes to heal a child of some disease

18
01:47 --> 01:53
If it is to heal a child, draw a
semi spiral in his hands

19
01:54 --> 01:59
Although to make it effective a ritual
must be done to heal completely

20
02:03 --> 02:06
And does makeup serve as a sunscreen?

21
02:07 --> 02:15
Yes, when looking for water it is applied in
the whole face, also for walking

22
02:16 --> 02:20
that's the makeup
of women to go out

23
02:24 --> 02:26
How is the makeup done?

24
02:28 --> 02:37
The suet of a small sheep is cooked or fried
and white, they stir it until it is thick,

25
02:38 --> 02:46
Then they apply it together with the pali´isa (a type of red chalk) on the face leaving only their eyes uncovered

26
02:47 --> 02:50
Can you tell us a little more about the pali´isa?

27
02:51 --> 02:56
Wayuu makeup is for the yonna, instead the other

28
02:57 --> 03:06
What I was telling you, it's more spiritual
which is usually requested through a dream.

29
03:07 --> 03:11
The acheepa has been something very ancestral by our grandparents,

30
03:12 --> 03:17
But, it has endured thanks to the new generation

31
03:19 --> 03:21
That's what our old folks say

32
03:22 --> 03:29
Today there are many forms of makeup
as well as different figures

33
03:30 --> 03:36
figures such as family symbols, the spiral among others.

34
03:37 --> 03:40
Can you tell us a little more about that?

35
03:41 --> 03:48
Those figures in the days before were just
on the cheek separately

36
03:49 --> 03:53
Little by little they were shaped in the face.

37
03:54 --> 03:59
There are many figures not seen now

38
04:00 --> 04:04
Those that were not transmitted by stories

39
04:08 --> 04:12
that about the symbols, what does that mean in life?

40
04:13 --> 04:21
The last question I asked you about the symbols,
You can graph what you want to put

41
04:22 --> 04:24
That is

42
04:25 --> 04:27
Makeup has an origin in dreams earlier.

43
04:28 --> 04:36
They were made because sometimes they said that they should put that on the girl,
So that she does not get sick or so that the virus that is going to come does not touch her

44
04:37 --> 04:40
Because the material it has, red represents blood

45
04:41 --> 04:45
This was for the spirits so they don’t,

46
04:46 --> 04:53
They move away, no? in ancient times I mean, now they are used in celebrations
And for the celebration and things like that

47
04:54 --> 04:57
and what is the color made of?

48
04:59 --> 05:01
you already asked

49
05:02 --> 05:04
That is a plant that is macerated

50
05:05 --> 05:07
And that plant has that tone

51
05:08 --> 05:10
and where do you get it from?

52
05:11 --> 05:16
What they are asking is where does the pali´isa (red chalk) come from ?

53
05:17 --> 05:20
Where do they get it from to obtain that red

54
05:21 --> 05:26
To obtain it, you search among the mountains

55
05:27 --> 05:32
There isn't here because it has a specific area
Around the mountains

56
05:33 --> 05:41
To prepare it and make it the shape of a bun

57
05:42 --> 05:45
The one that does it,

58
05:47 --> 05:54
Has to knead it and shape it to make it look like that

59
05:56 --> 05:59
This plant has its leaves too

60
06:02 --> 06:09
The leaves are used for thirst, it is cooked and drunk.

61
06:12 --> 06:14
And that pali´isa (red chalk) Is it given to the ladies?

62
06:15 --> 06:20
Of course, it is given to the ladies to drink

63
06:21 --> 06:26
So that they are beautiful with a firm body

64
06:36 --> 06:45
After childbirth they are also given and can have
Up to five children, they also drink it then

65
06:46 --> 06:53
The red chalk helps not only the ladies but all of them,
Plans the pregnancy too

66
07:01 --> 07:03
with what?, with the leaves of pali´isa

67
07:11 --> 07:12
you recorded that last one

68
07:13 --> 07:15
it's good? Very good contribution

69
07:16 --> 07:22
She spoke about the makeup that is used, it is not only for
Makeup for various things.

70
07:23 --> 07:29
And why do only women wear that?
why not men

71
07:30 --> 07:36
He says why the makeup?

72
07:37 --> 07:42
Or the figures, can't men wear them ?

73
07:43 --> 07:45
It is applied to the one who is going to dance

74
07:47 --> 07:50
Everyone has their acheepa (makeup) in the yonna

75
07:52 --> 08:00
And when they are on the piyoi (dance floor)
The man shouts jou'se (come!)

76
08:01 --> 08:04
That's how it's done the dance

77
08:07 --> 08:12
Can you repeat what you said about makeup?
of the man

78
08:13 --> 08:14
the what?, the acheepa

79
08:15 --> 08:22
The man is painted when it’s time to dance,
Figures are also put on him as well

80
08:30 --> 08:36
She explained it, she clarified that it is not limited
even women only

81
08:37 --> 08:40
And where do they learn all this from?

82
08:41 --> 08:49
the question is who teaches this in the community?

83
08:50 --> 08:52
How do they learn?

84
08:53 --> 08:55
the fact that? to learn that

85
09:56 --> 09:02
This? Yes, you know that not everyone knows about the acheepa

86
09:03 --> 09:11
I know it because I have the knowledge of the piachi (spiritualist)
I don't know it just for the sake of knowing

87
09:12 --> 09:20
I can make a person let go of hatred or resentment

88
09:21 --> 09:23
Because I am a piachi (spiritualist)

89
09:27 --> 09:34
It seemed that you were giving the blessing
To women when she did that

90
09:35 --> 09:36
if I asked her

91
09:37 --> 09:41
She just made it clear that not everyone
You can do that, which are gifts

92
09:42 --> 09:49
She has the gift of being able to see, what was I telling you right now,
The eye, right? Yeah.

93
09:50 --> 09:58
She can read people, so that's a gift too.
for makeup

94
10:01 --> 10:06
The make-up thing is original
Because now everyone paints

95
10:07 --> 10:11
But mostly they are similar, so which one
is the question you are going to ask

96
10:15 --> 10:20
I could say your name and what do you do?

97
10:22 --> 10:24
I'm going to ask the question that you said first

98
10:26 --> 10:27
If you bless women as you say

99
10:28 --> 10:36
He asks about the figures
that did you draw on the girls

100
10:37 --> 10:44
You were talking and he asks what was
you told them while you painted them

101
10:45 --> 10:47
That is, what did you tell them when painting them?

102
10:48 --> 10:55
What I said to them at the time of painting them
it was that he was putting the pali´isa to them to dance

103
10:56 --> 11:01
I told them that I was putting makeup on them so that
they show the ancestral steps of our yonna

104
11:02 --> 11:07
I also told them that I was putting them makeup on them so
They have fun, to play

105
11:08 --> 11:09
That's how it is

106
11:13 --> 11:15
Ok, you have answers

107
11:16 --> 11:18
And what's her name? where is she from?

108
11:29 --> 11:34
He says say your name where are you from? you stand out
that you are wayúu because they know several ethnic groups

109
11:35 --> 11:39
Of course I'm wayuu, I'm not an imitation or something like that

110
11:40 --> 11:43
And my name is Catalina Epieyu

111
11:48 --> 11:49
A pleasure, thank you very much

112
11:55 --> 11:56
Did you get it? Yes Yes.

113
12:01 --> 12:02
What else? she just said her name and her clan

114
12:04 --> 12:07
He just told you about the job right now
with the eye right now

115
12:08 --> 12:15
Although that's a lengthy explanation as well,
But I think that she can explain a little
more of that gift I don't know what you think

116
12:16 --> 12:20
Yes, that and also its connection with nature

117
12:21 --> 12:22
Ok, there were two questions, right?

118
12:23 --> 12:28
A while ago you mentioned that you were a piache (spiritualists)

119
12:29 --> 12:34
In our territory, not everyone can be a piache, right? Yeah

120
12:35 --> 12:40
How is a piachi formed according to ancient tales?

121
12:41 --> 12:42
In order to receive the gift?

122
12:43 --> 12:49
Yes of course.
that is because of a dream, the dream tells you that you are going to have that gift

123
12:51 --> 12:53
start to see beyond

124
12:54 --> 13:01
If you see a sick girl, your good eye tells you what to do

125
13:05 --> 13:12
He says " look for a jawapia (medicinal plant) for that girl
so that “the evil eye” she has goes away”

126
13:15 --> 13:20
The same if it is for a confinement or for something else,
this is more or less how the gift works

127
13:28 --> 13:29
The thing about the arijunas is something else

128
13:35 --> 13:40
I have heard a tale that says there is a dream for
the spirits to arrive

129
13:41 --> 13:45
Someone from Manaure told me that in her dream

130
13:46 --> 13:50
a person came to her when they are ladies

131
13:51 --> 13:56
What did that dream allow you to have that gift?

132
13:57 --> 14:03
It allows me to see spirits

133
14:04 --> 14:10
As the spirit gets closer
I see it well, but when it is very close I stop seeing it

134
14:14 --> 14:22
The spirits of a spiritualist are in the afterlife
that's why they see everything

135
14:23 --> 14:29
Spirits do not wander on Earth like those
of the dead, as that is something very different

136
14:33 --> 14:37
Yes it is correct, another question to finish

137
14:38 --> 14:42
He has just explained to you how the gift is obtained,
Which is through dreams

138
14:48 --> 14:53
When they are young ladies they have a dream where they see a giant character facing them

139
14:54 --> 14:57
But that character does not speak to them, but when
is very close to them they disappear

140
14:58 --> 15:04
So that's the spirit with which they walk now

141
15:08 --> 15:12
Ok, to end the interview

142
15:16 --> 15:20
What he wants to know is regarding the
connection with nature

143
15:27 --> 15:32
Everything we know has a spiritual connotation

144
15:33 --> 15:36
For example, if a person moves, they must sacrifice
an animal to shed its blood

145
15:37 --> 15:46
It has a spiritual connotation, but at the same time
has a dark spiritual connotation

146
15:47 --> 15:52
When a person arrives in a new territory, they must
have food coffee drinks etc.

147
15:55 --> 15:57
If you don't do it, a child will die, because with the ritual it is
As if you buy your stay in the territory somehow

148
15:58 --> 16:05
What else does the spiritual imply?

149
16:06 --> 16:10
Everything has a spiritual connotation, as well as that of
defy god

150
16:11 --> 16:12
If the ritual is not done, the price may be the
son they love the most

151
16:13 --> 16:20
And the animals?

152
16:21 --> 16:25
It affects their animals because by not doing the ritual they
they fade away little by little

153
16:26 --> 16:33
They can even have cows, even so, they will run out of animals for not asking the permission of the land through the ritual

4:33 p.m. 4:34 p.m.
And with the water?

154
16:35 --> 16:39
It is also the same if the child of that person reaches out
for water in the well, the child can fall into it

155
16:40 --> 16:48
The spirit makes them fall into the well when it makes them lean over to fall to the bottom and drowns them

156
16:54 --> 16:57
You just talked about nature itself being a living being

157
16:58 --> 17:01
A clear example is when a person goes to
move to another place

158
17:02 --> 17:06
When you are going to move, you must
shed the goat's blood

159
17:07 --> 17:13
It's like an acceptance of nature in that locality

160
17:14 --> 17:21
If you arrive without killing the goat, you will not be well accepted.

161
17:22 --> 17:27
That's why it was very important that we cook
goat today as an acceptance

162
17:28 --> 17:33
Because that way, things go well for us, and because the spirits, according to the evangelical belief, are pleased

163
17:34 --> 17:43
Then she mentioned constantly that all nature
both the water, the vegetation even the goats
there is a being that takes care of them there

164
17:44 --> 17:52
If we mistreat these animals, they are going to leave us, they are not going to produce, that is why it is necessary to caress them, we have to talk to them

165
17:53 --> 17:58
That's why she says we respect that connection, if
I have that connection I understand nature

166
17:59 --> 18:01
I don't know what we are going to ask her now

167
18:02 --> 18:05
Ask her how she relates to the wind

168
18:06 --> 18:13
As there is a lot of wind now, I don't know if it's something
that should you ask

169
18:22 --> 18:26
It got lost. it got lost? No, I want to explore the land

170
18:27 --> 18:31
to understand the culture

171
20:35 --> 20:40
See how things are with the arrival of your visitors

172
20:41 --> 20:47
You see how things are, he did not leave just because, some spirit from those around us unconsciously called him to take him away

173
20:53 --> 20:56
If there were no evil spirit among us,
he wouldn't have left like that on his own

174
20:56 --> 21:03
He would have asked or asked for the company of some of the
boys to take him where he was going

175
21:04 --> 21:09
You see how each thing has its connotation, that's why
must make a good harmonization with food today

176
21:10 --> 21:12
So that it does not affect the life of a child here

177
21:13 --> 21:15
There are a lot of evil spirits right now and it knows what's going on

178
21:13 --> 21:22
To definitely wrap up,

179
21:26 --> 21:34
We already spoke about the water and its spirits,
as well as our Juya (rain) our father

180
21:35 --> 21:40
We also talk about dreams and their meaning

181
21:41 --> 21:46
However, there is something that is rarely talked about and it is
regarding the wind

182
21:48 --> 21:52
Because if we ask a village elder
about the wind, he does not know the answer

183
21:52 --> 21:53
It is something that is commonly unknown

184
21:54 --> 21:57
And I was wondering if you could share something about the wind

185
21:58 --> 22:03
If a person dreams of the wind, it is because they’re
going to be hit by a car

186
22:04 --> 22:08
What he asks is regarding the history of the wind in ancient times.

187
22:09 --> 22:17
He was a strong mythological being who climbed
up to the sky in a swirl

188
22:18 --> 22:24
The whirlpool is formed from the earth in a circle and
slowly ascending to the sky

189
22:25 --> 22:30
If you could see one now you would realize that
he forms from the earth to vanish in the sky

190
22:33 --> 22:42
If the wind is always among us and even gives
signs of when someone is their chosen one

191
22:43 --> 22:48
If he liked a woman a lot, he
manifests through the swirl

192
22:49 --> 22:53
He is very good at picking people

193
23:00 --> 23:08
They have something, not deeply from the wind, but if something
from the dream, what meaning does the wind have in the dream

194
23:10 --> 23:16
Can you talk a bit about the footprints? That you are very good at finding tracks

195
23:17 --> 23:19
It's because of the herding, we are very good at herding

196
23:53 --> 24:01
Being a woman in Wayuu society, the importance
That it has, How does that work here?

197
24:03 --> 24:06
The importance of women? Yeah

198
24:09 --> 24:10
can you talk to us a bit

199
24:11 --> 24:15
On the social organization of the Wayúu

200
24:16 --> 24:20
Can you tell us a bit about that?

201
24:22 --> 24:24
Our children that are women, they are our family

202
24:25 --> 24:33
Instead, the sons of the men are belong to
another family (mother's). That's how it is

203
24:34 --> 24:41
Why are women important for the future?

204
24:42 --> 24:46
Women are important and necessary because
they are the ones that are going to keep that learning

205
24:42 --> 24:50
They are the ones who are going to share everything about culture,
They are the ones that will preserve what we are

206
24:51 --> 24:57
They are going to make our culture continue when we are no longer here.

207
24:58 --> 25:02
So you don't get lost, of course.

208
25:06 --> 25:08
yes, she mentioned how important and how is our matrilineal structure

209
25:16 --> 25:22
And how is that presented on a day-to-day basis?

210
25:25 --> 25:29
More than anything it is how we live that tradition

211
25:41 --> 25:45
That is why I also clarify it a lot, the maternal line

212
25:47 --> 25:52
She said, the one who has rights over the children is the woman

213
25:53 --> 25:57
Because the paternal does not have as much involvement

214
25:58 --> 26:01
We also saw red a lot. How important is it?
that for culture? for the women?

215
26:08 --> 26:15
The dance too, if you can explain the yonna dance

216
26:16 --> 26:20
They are very curious about the yonna when
they saw the children dance

217
26:22 --> 26:26
Can you tell us what is the yonna? And why is
dance in a circle

218
26:27 --> 26:34
And why did the sky dance backwards?

219
26:35 --> 26:36
So it should be, that is their position since ancient times

220
26:37 --> 26:40
But tell us a little more

221
26:41 --> 26:45
Since ancient times it has been transmitted like this,
he must face the woman during the dance

222
26:47 --> 26:55
Likewise, the woman goes straight ahead, that's why she avoids him,
or they cross paths to make him take more turns seeking her, making him tired

223
26:56 --> 27:02
It is known that several steps are shown in the yonna
Can you talk to us about that?

224
27:08 --> 27:15
Yes, there are several steps, for example the horse race

225
27:16 --> 27:19
If a girl stands out in that step, her makeup goes
according to that

226
27:20 --> 27:28
And when they see her, they immediately recognize her by her ability.
in that step because each one has a specialty

227
27:29 --> 27:34
The pace of the horse race is very traditional,
although not very common

228
27:36 --> 27:39
Today they are taking it up again

229
27:41 --> 27:44
Because that step was taken from horse racing
and they played with imitating it

230
27:45 --> 27:51
By imitating it they adopted it at the dance

231
27:52 --> 27:55
That's right, well she just talked about the yonna, about
tradition, bordering on the concept of the circle

232
27:56 --> 28:04
ok ma'am thank you

233
28:33 --> 28:36
Thank you for talking about our culture

234
28:37 --> 28:42
What was recorded so it stays later for the children

235
28:44 --> 28:47
So that when you are not here, they can say that they have at least the recording of their grandmother's words

236
28:52 --> 28:59
Because the words are there, but, they can be
forgotten too

237
29:03 --> 29:08
Of course, because nobody saves them and that is why they are forgotten

238
29:09 --> 29:13
Yes, but now it is recorded on the camera and that
you will see it later

239
29:20 --> 29:27
Yes, the children become Westernized, at least one of
Takes an interest in culture

240
29:28 --> 29:30
And if they wonder how our culture was like, they
Surely can find an answer in the recording

241
29:31 --> 29:38
Yes, surely in the future children will wonder about
the stories and tales that you’re sharing with us

242
29:42 --> 29:45
Yes, because today's children do not follow
the teaching of our elders

243
29:46 --> 29:52
Yes, it is true, see that there are no children in si'ira anymore
(wayúu weaving) and these are very necessary to keep us

244
29:53 --> 29:59
The kou'su (wayúu footwear) is no longer used now either

245
30:00 --> 30:05
that was our identity

246
30:06 --> 30:11
She just spoke about the importance of preserving and preserving identity.

247
30:34 --> 30:36
Maybe a message you want to take to the world

248
30:40 --> 30:45
Kids these days

249
30:50 --> 30:55
They don't own their culture as much as before

250
300:56 --> 31:05
In the past people respected each other, they lived in peace and harmony

251
31:06 --> 31:10
Nowadays nephews want to hit their uncles

252
31:11 --> 31:15
No respect even for older brothers

253
31:16 --> 31:20
It is the same with women, they no longer respect
their older brothers

254
31:21 --> 31:23
We ourselves have affected our culture

255
31:24 --> 31:32
If they asked you what your message would be to talk and
strengthen our culture? what would you say

256
31:33 --> 31:39
It is what they want to hear, to know how to reaffirm
what we are as wayuu

257
31:52 --> 31:58
Because even the Wayúu youth of today
devalue our culture

258
32:01 --> 32:04
Before, young people respected their uncles

259
32:06 --> 32:12
If an uncle caught his nephew's attention,
he was silent and listened

260
32:13 --> 32:20
He waited for their uncle to finish talking and didn't answer him

261
32:21 --> 32:27
Today's young kids, like you, don't like
being called out and wish harm upon their mothers

262
32:30 --> 32:38
Today's children and young people must highlight
the role of their uncle when they are in a conflict

263
32:40 --> 32:47
But that depends on us mothers, we must
enhance those values and principles

264
32:48 --> 32:52
Although they do not value our teachings

265
32:53 --> 32:59
And I know why I'm saying because I see it, I don't say it just because

266
33:06 --> 33:06
Well, more than a message for the world is a message for the culture itself

267
33:08 --> 33:12
We need to return to the times of the past

268
33:13 --> 33:22
Where respect was the main value of culture

269
33:23 --> 33:26
In these moments we have already lost our children, they do not want to respect us

270
33:27 --> 33:29
Our uncles are already disrespecting each other

271
33:30 --> 33:35
Then it is to return to teach the new generations, that we return to be Wayúu in humanity.

272
33:36 --> 33:37
Thank you

273
33:38 --> 33:42
Thank you very much he says.
