1
00:02 --> 00:07
Good morning, my name is Magalys Polanco,
of Pausayu lineage from usijo'jewat

2
00:10 --> 00:17
I am here to talk to you about the role of
the woman within the wayuu people

3
00:18 --> 00:24
The woman in our culture is the base of everything

4
00:29 --> 00:34
Women are the basis of our existence
same as wayuu

5
00:35 --> 00:36
Because we are

6
00:40 --> 00:49
The generators of lives, we guide our
children to maintain us as a people

7
00:50 --> 00:57
That's why we are sacred and with great value
within our culture

8
00:59 --> 01:07
Because we are transmitting from generation to generation
in generation our legacy as wayuu

9
01:11 --> 01:14
From them comes, for example

10
01:18 --> 01:26
Our social organization, as well as me who
I am from the Pausayu lineage

11
01:29 --> 01:35
We will always be of our mother's lineage
because it is from her that we come

12
01:36 --> 01:43
That is why we do not carry the lineage of our father but of our mother.

13
01:45 --> 01:53
In addition, women are formative mothers because they are
those who guide children from an early age

14
01:56 --> 02:01
They train children, instill in them values

15
02:04 --> 02:07
And he instills principles in them from childhood.

16
02:09 --> 02:15
That is, women have many roles
essential in our culture

17
02:17 --> 02:24
We form from our womb, we
we breastfeed and then take care of them and raise them

18
02:26 --> 02:34
We teach them about the different roles and
trades within our territory

19
02:36 --> 02:44
And in our house, how to look for water, wash
and other chores

20
02:45 --> 02:46
Both at home and in general

21
02:47 --> 02:52
How to help graze, to get the milk.

22
02:54 --> 02:57
Teach him to be immersed with animals

23
03:00 --> 03:06
teach girls how to make
hammocks and backpacks

24
03:09 --> 03:13
The woman herself is the base of everything because she is
the one with more roles than the man

25
03:14 --> 03:21
Although man also plays a role that in
In this case, the maternal uncle is the one who advocates for the family

26
03:23 --> 03:27
He is the one who sits down to solve a
conflict through dialogue

27
03:28 --> 03:32
And we also instilled that in them, that they have to
respect your uncles

28
03:34 --> 03:35
We tell our children

29
03:37 --> 03:39
we too

30
03:40 --> 03:47
We train our girls when they become
ladies we can do it mothers or grandmothers

31
03:48 --> 03:56
We take care of her and guide her in the ritual of confinement
in her first menstruation

32
03:57 --> 04:01
And he is taken out of the house until he finishes his
first menstruation

33
04:02 --> 04:08
During and after this ritual you are given some
Wayuu medicinal plants

34
04:09 --> 04:13
And they are our jobs as Wayuu women

35
04:14 --> 04:18
When our daughters grow up, you are ready.
for marriage

36
04:21 --> 04:28
They get married, the man asks for her hand if he sees that it is
a good woman

37
04:31 --> 04:37
It is there where the maternal uncle or his father sits at
discuss commitment

38
04:39 --> 04:44
To agree to agreements in order to close the commitment
before the wedding

39
04:48 --> 04:50
That's one of the uncle's roles

40
04:52 --> 04:54
Another thing, a woman

41
04:55 --> 04:59
When there is a conflict

42
05:00 --> 05:06
You must find a way to soften men

43
05:07 --> 05:11
She is the one who knows how to talk to them and how to appease their anger

44
05:12 --> 05:19
You need to tell them it's not okay to be in conflict
should never aggravate the problem but the opposite

45
05:21 --> 05:27
Women should always talk to men
as well as their children in the midst of some problem

46
05:29 --> 05:34
She must always emphasize to them that she is not
okay to be in conflict with others

47
05:36 --> 05:44
That's why she's always willing to solve it
to give their jewels as a reward

48
05:45 --> 05:51
She says here I have my animals so that
reward the problem and thus be in harmony

49
05:52 --> 05:57
and this is more or less the role of women
in the wayuu culture

50
05:59 --> 06:02
When our daughters have their husband

51
06:06 --> 06:12
We must look for his uncle or his father if there is none

52
06:13 --> 06:17
To be the representative of the family
in the commitment

53
06:18 --> 06:26
The mother tells her brother about the marriage proposal

54
06:27 --> 06:35
So, he must ask for the dowry for the bride, that is, animals.

55
06:37 --> 06:44
The necklaces, cows, goats among others.

56
06:45 --> 06:48
Although I emphasize that in ancient times mules were requested

57
06:51 --> 06:59
I clarify that this is not buying the woman but
gain respect in the bride's family

58
07:01 --> 07:10
What man buys are animals and
goods to be respected and valued

59
07:11 --> 07:18
In his wife's family, that's why it's important
delivery of the dowry by the man

60
07:19 --> 07:25
If the man does not give the dowry, he is not valued or respected

61
07:27 --> 07:29
Is that how it works

62
07:30 --> 07:34
When a woman gets married

63
07:35 --> 07:41
Well, now I'm going to talk about my trade

64
07:43 --> 07:51
I have been working on something for 10 years when I went
India

65
07:55 --> 07:58
Ten years ago when I went to India

66
07:59 --> 08:04
I lived there for six months

67
08:05 --> 08:06
I was gone

68
08:09 --> 08:14
To embark on a new experience during the
time I was

69
08:17 --> 08:23
I went to take a course where we teach you
Of electricity

70
08:24 --> 08:27
I learned to make a lamp

71
08:29 --> 08:37
I learned how to make a controller, one that works
through solar energy

72
08:38 --> 08:41
By means of a battery, that was what I learned there

73
08:44 --> 08:52
Although it was very difficult for me because I didn't
knew the language of the Hindus

74
08:53 --> 09:00
It got very complicated for me, but I made signs to
communicate with them

75
09:01 --> 09:04
And thanks to that I learned a lot of things from
there and of the Hindus

76
09:06 --> 09:13
And when I got back from India they told me I had to
bring electricity to my community

77
09:17 --> 09:20
And they sent me materials for that

78
09:21 --> 09:27
As for 75 families in the community

79
09:28 --> 09:36
Although it took 2 years to get there because I
sent by boat to the community

80
09:39 --> 09:42
And with what the arijunas gave us
(people from other cultures)

81
09:45 --> 09:52
I organized everything so that each family had solar energy

82
09:56 --> 10:00
Although now they are no longer working almost because
it's already years old

83
10:01 --> 10:06
The batteries are already worn out and old.

84
10:07 --> 10:13
Although we are already looking for help
with new batteries

85
10:17 --> 10:26
However, for now we will be without power. we came back
to how we were before without energy with nothing

86
10:29 --> 10:34
Although my wish is that we have energy again

87
10:35 --> 10:40
So that the children do not suffer at night
to do homework and so on

88
10:41 --> 10:49
'Cause children in the dark can't do
nothing to advance with your studies

89
10:51 --> 10:56
And I would like some foundation or organization
Will help us

90
10:57 --> 11:05
For the energy to return, because I am willing
to do everything possible to achieve it

91
11:06 --> 11:12
For my community, I just need some materials
like batteries

92
11:14 --> 11:17
Because the rest is

93
11:18 --> 11:25
However, I am happy to have brought the
source of solar energy to my community

94
11:26 --> 11:28
That same one I instill in the children of now

95
11:30 --> 11:37
That is, I teach them how devices work like
circuit boards

96
11:38 --> 11:42
And the children really like being taught

97
11:43 --> 11:48
Well, that's what I can share with you.
that experience

98
12:21 --> 12:26
In our culture women have an important value

99
12:29 --> 12:34
So much so that when they separate, the family weighs more
of his mother in a decision

100
12:35 --> 12:40
Yes, the maternal uncle is like the father, the father
biological does not have as much implication

101
12:42 --> 12:47
Could you tell us a little more about that topic?

102
12:48 --> 12:55
Why our social organization starts
of our mother

103
12:56 --> 12:59
Yes, it has always been through the matrilineal line
and not from the father

104
13:01 --> 13:06
I explain a little more, yes, well.

105
13:07 --> 13:08
Ready? Yeah.

106
13:11 --> 13:13
Our matrilineal line is strong

107
13:15 --> 13:22
Because when a father separates from his wife
the matrilineal is what prevails

108
13:23 --> 13:28
Since we are the ones who stay
with our children

109
13:29 --> 13:36
The mothers are the ones who form and the father alone
It is practically biological

110
13:37 --> 13:46
He can leave and nothing happens, because the father
of our children is our brother as a mother

111
13:47 --> 13:54
The maternal uncle is the one who weighs when it comes to taking
decisions about our children

112
13:55 --> 14:00
That's why if the father wants to leave, he leaves and nothing happens

113
14:01 --> 14:09
Because what is important is the matrilineal lineage
through the clan

114
14:10 --> 14:19
for this reason, women are the foundation of our organization
social from mother

115
14:20 --> 14:25
On the other hand, the father does not, because he does not influence so much
that's why you can go normal

116
14:34 --> 14:41
Could you say where we are now and what is
the difference here with Manaure and Uribia?

117
14:42 --> 14:43
What he wanted to say?

118
14:45 --> 14:49
Where are we now?

119
14:50 --> 14:56
And what is the difference here with the other areas?

120
14:57 --> 15:01
I don't know Manaure that well

121
15:02 --> 15:06
Well now we meet in Nazareth
what is the north zone

122
15:07 --> 15:14
The way of speaking here is very different from those in Uribia

123
15:15 --> 15:19
They say shia we jia but both
they mean the same (that)

124
15:20 --> 15:27
What we have here is a bit of ease with
the water, and it's quiet territory

125
15:28 --> 15:35
The land is good for animals because
there is grass and that gives us more animals

126
15:36 --> 15:41
And when there is no grass, they still feed in the mountains

127
15:43 --> 15:48
On the other hand, in Uribia, I understand that there are
lack of drinking water and that the temperature is even higher

128
15:49 --> 15:53
Here we are fine, well in this northern area

129
15:55 --> 16:00
Now we are in Ksyushupanoi the
my father's territory

130
16:01 --> 16:07
Here they love us very much, they treat us well and they respect us a lot.

131
16:08 --> 16:13
That's why we are together living in harmony

132
16:14 --> 16:16
Here we are very happy

133
16:23 --> 16:29
And how constant is it for you to be in a city
versus being in a field?

134
16:31 --> 16:36
Being in the city is not easy because there are
to buy everything there

135
16:39 --> 16:43
You have to always have money, something we don't have

136
16:44 --> 16:49
Instead, here we have our animals
so as not to suffer from hunger

137
16:50 --> 16:57
We are going to Nazareth to sell our sheep, our
goats and from them we get food

138
16:58 --> 17:03
We don't spend buying other things because here
we have what it takes

139
17:04 --> 17:11
We have milk that animals give us, meat and
our own garden

140
17:12 --> 17:18
Where we plant grains, pumpkin corn and a little bit of everything

141
17:19 --> 17:27
Therefore, we do not suffer from anything here, but rather
otherwise we live well

142
17:28 --> 17:29
and we are fine

143
17:31 --> 17:37
We do not have to be thinking about what we are going to
eat because we live well fortunately

144
17:40 --> 17:44
And as. If we have our own milk,
meat, fruits and others

145
17:47 --> 17:49
Unlike the city

146
17:50 --> 17:58
If a young man goes to study in the city, he goes through
many needs

147
17:59 --> 18:05
He begins to miss his territory and what
he fed here

148
18:06 --> 18:10
On the other hand, in the city you must have money to
everything or else you will suffer

149
18:11 --> 18:16
Well, that's what those who have gone to study at the University have told us.

150
18:17 --> 18:19
Those who have already experienced it

151
18:22 --> 18:29
Because the others have not gone because there is no money or
rather because his mom doesn't have it

152
18:31 --> 18:33
As soon as they finish high school they stay
just here and now

153
18:36 --> 18:43
Can you explain to me what are the sacred sites there?
and which ones are we going to see tomorrow?

154
18:45 --> 18:54
One of the sacred sites is Wolunka from where
it's me, that's my territory

155
18:55 --> 18:58
Where does my mother come from and my grandmother is there

156
19:00 --> 19:04
Because where we are now belongs to my dad

157
19:06 --> 19:07
Uriana (Magalys's father's bloodline)

158
19:08 --> 19:12
I am Pausayu and my father Uriana

159
19:20 --> 19:25
Can you explain to me too, like tomorrow
we are going to some places

160
19:26 --> 19:29
What is the importance they have?

161
19:31 --> 19:32
You understand me? No.

162
19:34 --> 19:40
He says that like tomorrow we are going to meet
some sacred sites

163
19:41 --> 19:46
They would like to know the importance of these sacred sites

164
19:51 --> 19:52
Wolunka

165
19:54 --> 20:00
According to the stories of the ancestors it was a woman

166
20:01 --> 20:04
That she had teeth in her vagina

167
20:05 --> 20:09
And there were also two young brothers

168
20:10 --> 20:17
Those who worried about leaving descendants.
They saw Wolunka when she bathed

169
20:18 --> 20:25
They saw the teeth in her vagina and they knew
that they couldn't even make her fall in love

170
20:26 --> 20:31
But they said they needed to leave descendants,
So they planned to knock out his teeth

171
20:33 --> 20:38
Where they knocked out his teeth, the water remained
reddish with Wolunka's blood

172
20:40 --> 20:44
You can also see the footprints and the stone from where you
they released the arrow, tomorrow we will see it

173
20:47 --> 20:51
That is the origin of that sacred site because the
woman was called Wolunka

174
21:01 --> 21:06
Alewalu, where we go tomorrow is also sacred

175
21:08 --> 21:12
Because since ancient times they used to find
valuable stones

176
21:14 --> 21:18
How tu'uma or other valuable stones they used
our ancestors

177
21:21 --> 21:27
That is why they also called it a sacred site.
because in it they found the most precious stones

178
21:30 --> 21:36
To make the jewels that we have inherited
our ancestors

179
21:38 --> 21:40
Of the stones of alewalu

180
22:05 --> 22:11
Where are the waterfalls? Yeah. That's where our
lineage also, the Pausayu

181
22:16 --> 22:25
Since you already mentioned the others, could you
tell us about where the waterfalls are

182
22:29 --> 22:36
I have heard that they call it the eye of the water. Yes, because it is a big waterfall

183
22:38 --> 22:43
Could you tell us more about that place with the waterfalls?

184
22:45 --> 22:49
A girl had an accident there years ago

185
22:55 --> 23:01
And Patsualu? It's the same one with the waterfalls too

186
23:02 --> 23:06
They have to tell Geovanny to locate them well tomorrow

187
23:21 --> 23:28
You can describe the place where all the animals drink water,
which we will visit as well. You can describe it?

188
23:29 --> 23:32
What is it and how important is it?

189
23:33 --> 23:35
The importance to the community?

190
23:37 --> 23:40
It is because of that same water

191
23:43 --> 23:46
All animals drink. That is, the one from the well

192
23:48 --> 23:51
Although before the water was extracted in an artisanal way

193
23:52 --> 23:58
But thanks to the alpina project energy was put
solar to drain water with motor

194
23:59 --> 24:07
The water is no longer drawn by hand, since that is how the
people suffered a lot

195
24:08 --> 24:12
Because they had to raise the bucket with water through
of a rope using only the strength of the arms

196
24:13 --> 24:19
Now it's just starting the engine and the water rises by itself
to give to all the animals

197
24:32 --> 24:38
What is your dream with the community?
How would you like to see the community grow?

198
24:40 --> 24:45
The first or main thing of all is what
I said a while ago

199
24:47 --> 24:52
That in the community the energy returns through
she solar energy

200
24:55 --> 24:59
So that the children can study, that they can
do your homework at night

201
25:02 --> 25:08
That cell phones can be charged since now
It's their turn to go to Nazareth to load them

202
25:10 --> 25:13
So I want there to be energy

203
25:14 --> 25:16
For us to be alright again

204
25:19 --> 25:20
aha that's all

205
25:23 --> 25:29
You can also describe the Sawa'a (roasted corn
ground) that we just saw and ate

206
25:30 --> 25:32
What is Sawa'a? and how is the process?

207
25:33 --> 25:34
Ah, the Sawa'a

208
25:35 --> 25:37
That's what we eat

209
25:38 --> 25:40
It's like our sweets

210
25:41 --> 25:50
First the corn is toasted, ground and added
panela to be delicious

211
25:51 --> 25:57
That is our snack in a share or meeting

212
25:58 --> 26:00
What is Sawa'a (sandstone)

213
26:02 --> 26:08
A clear example is when a conflict is to be resolved

214
26:10 --> 26:16
Or solve a problem between different families

215
26:18 --> 26:24
What is distributed during these meetings is the
Sawa'a to share among all

216
26:30 --> 26:39
Well, you living here in such a beautiful place,
I don't know if it has a connection with the mountains or with the
nature around you

217
26:40 --> 26:46
Yes, of course, with the animals, more than anything, with the goats.

218
26:49 --> 26:54
With the sheep, with the chickens

219
26:55 --> 26:58
everything around me

220
27:00 --> 27:04
As well as the garden that we make

221
27:06 --> 27:09
That's all

222
27:10 --> 27:17
They want to know something about spirituality
Of the territory

223
27:18 --> 27:24
The old say that there is a spirituality of everything

224
27:25 --> 27:32
In my community, for example, they say that through
From dreams they see the spirits of the mountains

225
27:35 --> 27:41
And the fishermen say that the sea has a
spirituality with some beings

226
27:44 --> 27:52
It's because of sleep too. Yes, could you go a little deeper?
for our guests

227
27:53 --> 27:58
Why we should not ignore the spiritual connotation
of the holy places

228
27:59 --> 28:07
The spirituality of the territory is through dreams,
if he tells us to play the Kasha (drum) we do

229
28:08 --> 28:17
If it is to attract the father rain we touch it, if it is
to harmonize one day you also play

230
28:18 --> 28:21
So that nothing bad happens to us

231
28:22 --> 28:28
So that diseases and pests do not reach the community

232
28:29 --> 28:37
If the earth starts to turn red, we already know that
we must play the kasha

233
28:38 --> 28:41
And make good food. All that the dream asks for

234
28:44 --> 28:49
Can you tell us who is mma'? or What is mma'?

235
28:50 --> 28:56
Mma' is the land, territory and our mother at the same time

236
29:08 --> 29:17
I wanted to ask you, for all the people who don't
They are Wayúu, which is what you would like us to learn from you.

237
29:18 --> 29:26
From their community, from their grandchildren, from the children. What can we learn? Of what you are and of your practices

238
29:27 --> 29:29
Respect for our culture

239
29:33 --> 29:41
that they recognize our value and that they do not make fun of
we for our clothing

240
29:43 --> 29:45
They respect our culture

241
29:47 --> 29:49
That you respect us rather

242
29:55 --> 29:56
Is it alright like this Neko? Yeah

243
30:03 --> 30:04
It's right

244
30:10 --> 30:15
If you have a message that you would take to the world
what would?

245
30:18 --> 30:24
Yes, that they respect and value our culture

246
30:25 --> 30:29
That they recognize us and respect us in any
corner of the world

247
30:30 --> 30:34
Because our culture is wonderful in every way

248
30:37 --> 30:43
We have diversity in crafts. AND
we respect those who are not wayúu

249
30:44 --> 30:53
So that there is mutual respect because, just as we respect them
we hope you respect us outside of here

250
30:55 --> 30:58
Don't make fun of us because of our clothes

251
31:00 --> 31:05
Because we respect the arijunas a lot
(someone who is not wayúu) when they arrive in the territory

252
31:07 --> 31:12
We are kind to them, although I admit that we are not.
we are all like that

253
31:15 --> 31:23
But, here in the north mutual respect is maintained
with ourselves and with the arijunas

254
31:25 --> 31:26
Well yes

255
31:46 --> 31:53
When we went to India they said that the blanket was very
beautiful because we went in a blanket

256
32:22 --> 32:25
Ready? we're ready, we're done

257
32:28 --> 32:33
And be careful if you are going to download that because there is nowhere
load it. You saw that we returned to the same thing again.

258
32:34 --> 32:38
I wanted to ask you something else about spirituality and magic

259
32:39 --> 32:41
What is magic for you?

260
32:42 --> 32:49
Spirituality manifests itself through sleep

261
32:50 --> 32:52
The Lania that is against

262
32:55 --> 32:58
That that is revealed through the dream

263
33:00 --> 33:07
The counter is a protection that is revealed through the dream

264
33:09 --> 33:13
In the dream he tells someone "today this is going to happen to you"

265
33:14 --> 33:20
But go there on the mountain where you will find such a plant

266
33:22 --> 33:24
You prepare it and bathe

267
33:26 --> 33:34
And that person has to fulfill what the dream asks for.
Because if you don't comply, something bad happens to you.

268
33:35 --> 33:38
And when he fulfills it, nothing happens to him

269
33:39 --> 33:44
Like the piachi (spiritualist) who has her spirituality
and their gifts

270
33:48 --> 33:52
Here previously there was an old lady who was the
children's piachi

271
33:53 --> 34:01
She was the one who cured the children, but the lady has already passed away.

272
34:02 --> 34:06
She also had her gifts her spirits

273
34:08 --> 34:16
She asked for either animals, necklaces or whatever she asked for.

274
34:19 --> 34:26
And if they did not comply, the baby would not heal and she
she was also affected because she got sick

275
34:28 --> 34:31
That's spirituality with dreams

276
34:37 --> 34:38
That's how it is in our culture

277
34:45 --> 34:47
What else? Other

278
34:48 --> 34:54
The importance of water, what is it?

279
34:55 --> 34:59
It's life, life

280
35:00 --> 35:06
It is essential for everyone, for humans and for animals.

281
35:07 --> 35:15
Without water there is no life, hence its importance to us.

282
35:16 --> 35:19
But we thank God that as long as we have water

283
35:22 --> 35:30
And in Nazareth? In Nazareth yes, because we have a stream about 10 meters away

284
35:31 --> 35:33
Is where we're going now

285
35:35 --> 35:39
It is different than other parts. Yes, like there where we passed

286
35:41 --> 35:46
That's why it's nice to live here, we don't lack anything, thank God

287
35:47 --> 35:52
And with the wind. yes you can breathe fresh air here

288
35:53 --> 35:59
Here the wind is very strong, you can tell me about the wind.
Yes because we are in summer

289
36:01 --> 36:09
There is a drought, from the month of June, July and August

290
36:13 --> 36:19
In September it suddenly starts to rain. the rain is coming

291
36:21 --> 36:24
The wind has died down a bit

292
36:25 --> 36:33
The wind also has a mythology in culture
wayúu or is a spirit or supernatural being

293
36:34 --> 36:36
I don't know much about that.

294
36:37 --> 36:42
The wind is not necessary. Yes of course

295
36:45 --> 36:47
our ancestors say

296
36:48 --> 36:54
That in the beginning beings like the sun were created,
the moon and the wind is their brother

297
36:55 --> 37:00
There are several types of winds, there is the normal one like that of
now and the whirlpool

298
37:01 --> 37:07
I don't know if you have any other information other than this.
No no I dont know

299
37:08 --> 37:11
Although they say that this represents hunger

300
37:14 --> 37:17
My dad says that when there is a lot of wind it is
why are you hungry

301
37:18 --> 37:23
I mean, for them it's because there's a drought

302
37:24 --> 37:30
There is summer and the animals no longer have to graze

303
37:31 --> 37:37
Because they get scared by this, when there is a lot of wind

304
37:39 --> 37:45
And the last thing you could tell us is how
How far are we from Uribia or Manaure?

305
37:46 --> 37:48
How long does it take to get here?

306
37:49 --> 37:53
It's far, it's 6 or 7 hours in a good car

307
37:56 --> 37:57
and more the sun

308
38:01 --> 38:06
It is a little removed and the path is a bit difficult

309
38:09 --> 38:14
And is there something else you want to share about your connection or your relationship with nature?

310
38:15 --> 38:20
With the earth, with the animals, with the wind, the
water or with that place

311
38:23 --> 38:27
Well, here I am fine, I feel calm in peace

312
38:29 --> 38:32
I breathe that tranquility

313
38:40 --> 38:42
I don't feel stressed

314
38:43 --> 38:45
Peace is breathed here

315
38:50 --> 38:52
Very good anayawasu (thank you)

316
39:00 --> 39:05
Well I wanted to know about something so we're not done

317
39:06 --> 39:12
I wanted to know about the sun and the moon, I don't know if there are
mythologies about it

318
39:13 --> 39:16
Or what role does the sun or the moon have?

319
39:20 --> 39:21
the moon yes

320
39:24 --> 39:27
The moon when it approaches

321
39:31 --> 39:37
The summer, the autumn that is on the moon

322
39:38 --> 39:45
My dad always told me, "it's not going to rain, it's already
the moon on that side"

323
39:46 --> 39:52
Says it's getting closer and it's really raining

324
39:53 --> 39:55
old men are wise

325
39:56 --> 40:01
My dad always says like this "look, it's going to rain"

326
40:02 --> 40:04
they, they

327
40:06 --> 40:09
They watch the time with the moon

328
40:10 --> 40:16
When it will rain, when it will not rain and when it will
be bad the rain

329
40:18 --> 40:23
They say "no this year it will not rain well, because
the moon is on this side"

330
40:24 --> 40:26
It's wrong like that

331
40:29 --> 40:34
And I tell my dad how do you know that? he tells me
than looking at the moon

332
40:35 --> 40:36
And so

333
40:38 --> 40:43
It's going to be bad the rain is going to rain a lot this year

334
40:44 --> 40:51
What other things did your dad teach you? oh the song
of a bird that always sings around

335
40:52 --> 40:58
So some say, no this year will not see rain
Look what that bird is singing

336
41:01 --> 41:05
What they say is true, it doesn't rain not enough

337
41:06 --> 41:12
Do the birds know? If the birds know, the old people, the grandparents too

338
41:16 --> 41:19
Of the sun if I don't know much Neko.

339
41:21 --> 41:25
It is a sun that heats nothing else, it is used for energy

340
41:27 --> 41:28
Yes too

341
41:31 --> 41:36
And if there is no sun, there is no energy, they do not charge
cool batteries

342
41:37 --> 41:43
Here we always have that problem and don't even mention it
rainy times

343
41:44 --> 41:48
Because the sun does not rise, all the time is cloudy

344
42:01 --> 42:07
What is your clan? And how important are the clans?

345
42:08 --> 42:12
The clans are what represent us

346
42:13 --> 42:22
Since each family has a clan and an animal
that represents it, that is, they have their dowry

347
42:23 --> 42:26
What is the clan mark?

348
42:29 --> 42:31
And what is your clan and your brand?

349
42:32 --> 42:33
I am Pausayu

350
42:36 --> 42:40
And the animal that represents me is the black wasp

351
42:41 --> 42:42
with a cool king

352
42:44 --> 42:46
And my mark is like a

353
42:50 --> 42:55
Maye you can show them our brand

354
43:03 --> 43:08
Show them please, that's on the right blanket. Yeah

355
43:12 --> 43:14
That's on the blanket, the mark

356
43:19 --> 43:24
Yes that. this one here

357
43:31 --> 43:35
Del Pausayu. I have it here on the forehead, if that's it.

358
43:43 --> 43:44
That is the one that represents us

359
43:47 --> 43:51
Everyone has their importance for each family

360
43:53 --> 43:58
They recognize him by that, where he is from or where he comes from

361
43:59 --> 44:06
I can have two brands on my animals

362
44:07 --> 44:11
I can take my dad's and I can put mine on that animal

363
44:18 --> 44:19
Here it is

364
44:21 --> 44:28
This is my dad's, Uriana is this family's. and this is ours

365
44:30 --> 44:32
I mean, we can take this

366
44:35 --> 44:39
I can use this to mark a cow or cattle

367
44:41 --> 44:44
We can mark this and this

368
44:45 --> 44:48
So that they differentiate us like the Urianas

369
44:50 --> 44:51
This is from a Pausayu

370
44:52 --> 44:56
Because we here are achon, that is, children of Uriana

371
45:00 --> 45:03
How many clans do you see there? How many?

372
45:08 --> 45:12
Many? Yes, there are several, there is Pushaina, for example

373
45:15 --> 45:16
Arpushana, if there are several

374
45:30 --> 45:32
How many animals do you have?

375
45:33 --> 45:38
Well, they are dying in my absence for a month over there

376
45:40 --> 45:44
Because they are careful, if the owner does not come

377
45:46 --> 45:47
that also exists

378
45:48 --> 45:53
'Cause they steal right here in the family, as you know
that one is not

379
45:55 --> 45:56
They sell them

380
46:02 --> 46:07
As they know that one is not there, but when one is here
don't mess with them

381
46:10 --> 46:13
Because one immediately follows the footprint, we follow it

382
46:14 --> 46:21
That's why there's no robbery here, and if we know who it is
poor him because he has to pay double or triple

383
46:22 --> 46:24
For one animal they have to pay ten

384
46:26 --> 46:27
ten sheep

385
46:31 --> 46:33
That takes away the desire to steal

386
46:35 --> 46:40
That is why there is peace, because that is the payment for a lack

387
46:45 --> 46:47
who wants to steal like that

388
46:48 --> 46:50
You have to do it well hidden

389
46:52 --> 46:56
And that is why there is peace because there is a payment
for the faults

390
46:57 --> 47:00
And that is a wayúu system. Yeah

391
47:01 --> 47:07
If there is no payment, there is a conflict, just as I told you that
the woman is the one who intervenes and so on.

392
47:09 --> 47:13
Like those countrymen from last night who formed us
a whole mess about it.

393
47:50 --> 47:57
One time, just for introduction, you could tell where from
you are now what do you do

394
48:02 --> 48:04
I am Magalys Polanco, wayúu Pausayu

395
48:06 --> 48:10
And my ancestral territory is Isi'jou

396
48:13 --> 48:15
What is in the Macuira, dune

397
48:17 --> 48:22
I am mother and grandmother

398
48:25 --> 48:31
And in my community I like to help people

399
48:34 --> 48:39
As I was saying, I took the solar energy course,
I also like

400
48:40 --> 48:45
Because being in the community is not very good

401
48:46 --> 48:51
One has to go to bed early if we are in the dark

402
48:53 --> 48:57
On the other hand, with energy one goes to bed later
because there is light

403
49:00 --> 49:05
We can do chores like knitting or reading

404
49:10 --> 49:13
And here in my house I work with the animals

405
49:16 --> 49:21
I take care of my goats, sheep, all the animals, the chickens

406
49:26 --> 49:28
And that's who I am in my community

407
49:31 --> 49:34
And when people come here, I like to help them

408
49:36 --> 49:39
and the book? Oh the book.

409
49:40 --> 49:45
Well we wrote a book with Juan David with the help of Neko

410
49:48 --> 49:51
About energy and what I did in India

411
49:57 --> 50:02
Anayawasü (thank you) Jatsü (it's over).
