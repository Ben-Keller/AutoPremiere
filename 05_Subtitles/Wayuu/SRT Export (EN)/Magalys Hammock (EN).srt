1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Good morning, my name is Magalys Polanco,
of Pausayu lineage from usijo'jewat

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I am here to talk to you about the role of
the woman within the wayuu people

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The woman in our culture is the base of everything

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Women are the basis of our existence
same as wayuu

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Because we are

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The generators of lives, we guide our
children to maintain us as a people

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That's why we are sacred and with great value
within our culture

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Because we are transmitting from generation to generation
in generation our legacy as wayuu

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
From them comes, for example

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Our social organization, as well as me who
I am from the Pausayu lineage

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We will always be of our mother's lineage
because it is from her that we come

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That is why we do not carry the lineage of our father but of our mother.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
In addition, women are formative mothers because they are
those who guide children from an early age

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
They train children, instill in them values

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And he instills principles in them from childhood.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That is, women have many roles
essential in our culture

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We form from our womb, we
we breastfeed and then take care of them and raise them

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We teach them about the different roles and
trades within our territory

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And in our house, how to look for water, wash
and other chores

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Both at home and in general

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
How to help graze, to get the milk.

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Teach him to be immersed with animals

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
teach girls how to make
hammocks and backpacks

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The woman herself is the base of everything because she is
the one with more roles than the man

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Although man also plays a role that in
In this case, the maternal uncle is the one who advocates for the family

26
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He is the one who sits down to solve a
conflict through dialogue

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And we also instilled that in them, that they have to
respect your uncles

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We tell our children

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
we too

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We train our girls when they become
ladies we can do it mothers or grandmothers

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We take care of her and guide her in the ritual of confinement
in her first menstruation

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And he is taken out of the house until he finishes his
first menstruation

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
During and after this ritual you are given some
Wayuu medicinal plants

34
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And they are our jobs as Wayuu women

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
When our daughters grow up, you are ready.
for marriage

36
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
They get married, the man asks for her hand if he sees that it is
a good woman

37
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It is there where the maternal uncle or his father sits at
discuss commitment

38
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
To agree to agreements in order to close the commitment
before the wedding

39
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's one of the uncle's roles

40
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Another thing, a woman

41
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
When there is a conflict

42
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You must find a way to soften men

43
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
She is the one who knows how to talk to them and how to appease their anger

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You need to tell them it's not okay to be in conflict
should never aggravate the problem but the opposite

45
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Women should always talk to men
as well as their children in the midst of some problem

46
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
She must always emphasize to them that she is not
okay to be in conflict with others

47
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's why she's always willing to solve it
to give their jewels as a reward

48
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
She says here I have my animals so that
reward the problem and thus be in harmony

49
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and this is more or less the role of women
in the wayuu culture

50
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
When our daughters have their husband

51
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We must look for his uncle or his father if there is none

52
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
To be the representative of the family
in the commitment

53
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The mother tells her brother about the marriage proposal

54
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So, he must ask for the dowry for the bride, that is, animals.

55
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The necklaces, cows, goats among others.

56
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Although I emphasize that in ancient times mules were requested

57
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I clarify that this is not buying the woman but
gain respect in the bride's family

58
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What man buys are animals and
goods to be respected and valued

59
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
In his wife's family, that's why it's important
delivery of the dowry by the man

60
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
If the man does not give the dowry, he is not valued or respected

61
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Is that how it works

62
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
When a woman gets married

63
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Well, now I'm going to talk about my trade

64
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I have been working on something for 10 years when I went
India

65
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Ten years ago when I went to India

66
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I lived there for six months

67
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I was gone

68
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
To embark on a new experience during the
time I was

69
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I went to take a course where we teach you
Of electricity

70
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I learned to make a lamp

71
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I learned how to make a controller, one that works
through solar energy

72
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
By means of a battery, that was what I learned there

73
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Although it was very difficult for me because I didn't
knew the language of the Hindus

74
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It got very complicated for me, but I made signs to
communicate with them

75
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And thanks to that I learned a lot of things from
there and of the Hindus

76
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And when I got back from India they told me I had to
bring electricity to my community

77
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And they sent me materials for that

78
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
As for 75 families in the community

79
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Although it took 2 years to get there because I
sent by boat to the community

80
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And with what the arijunas gave us
(people from other cultures)

81
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I organized everything so that each family had solar energy

82
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Although now they are no longer working almost because
it's already years old

83
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The batteries are already worn out and old.

84
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Although we are already looking for help
with new batteries

85
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:26,000
However, for now we will be without power. we came back
to how we were before without energy with nothing

86
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Although my wish is that we have energy again

87
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So that the children do not suffer at night
to do homework and so on

88
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
'Cause children in the dark can't do
nothing to advance with your studies

89
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And I would like some foundation or organization
Will help us

90
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
For the energy to return, because I am willing
to do everything possible to achieve it

91
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
For my community, I just need some materials
like batteries

92
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Because the rest is

93
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
However, I am happy to have brought the
source of solar energy to my community

94
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That same one I instill in the children of now

95
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That is, I teach them how devices work like
circuit boards

96
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And the children really like being taught

97
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Well, that's what I can share with you.
that experience

98
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
In our culture women have an important value

99
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So much so that when they separate, the family weighs more
of his mother in a decision

100
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yes, the maternal uncle is like the father, the father
biological does not have as much implication

101
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Could you tell us a little more about that topic?

102
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Why our social organization starts
of our mother

103
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yes, it has always been through the matrilineal line
and not from the father

104
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I explain a little more, yes, well.

105
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Ready? Yeah.

106
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Our matrilineal line is strong

107
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Because when a father separates from his wife
the matrilineal is what prevails

108
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Since we are the ones who stay
with our children

109
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The mothers are the ones who form and the father alone
It is practically biological

110
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He can leave and nothing happens, because the father
of our children is our brother as a mother

111
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The maternal uncle is the one who weighs when it comes to taking
decisions about our children

112
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's why if the father wants to leave, he leaves and nothing happens

113
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Because what is important is the matrilineal lineage
through the clan

114
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:19,000
for this reason, women are the foundation of our organization
social from mother

115
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
On the other hand, the father does not, because he does not influence so much
that's why you can go normal

116
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Could you say where we are now and what is
the difference here with Manaure and Uribia?

117
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What he wanted to say?

118
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Where are we now?

119
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And what is the difference here with the other areas?

120
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I don't know Manaure that well

121
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Well now we meet in Nazareth
what is the north zone

122
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The way of speaking here is very different from those in Uribia

123
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
They say shia we jia but both
they mean the same (that)

124
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What we have here is a bit of ease with
the water, and it's quiet territory

125
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The land is good for animals because
there is grass and that gives us more animals

126
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And when there is no grass, they still feed in the mountains

127
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
On the other hand, in Uribia, I understand that there are
lack of drinking water and that the temperature is even higher

128
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Here we are fine, well in this northern area

129
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Now we are in Ksyushupanoi the
my father's territory

130
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Here they love us very much, they treat us well and they respect us a lot.

131
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's why we are together living in harmony

132
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Here we are very happy

133
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And how constant is it for you to be in a city
versus being in a field?

134
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Being in the city is not easy because there are
to buy everything there

135
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You have to always have money, something we don't have

136
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Instead, here we have our animals
so as not to suffer from hunger

137
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
We are going to Nazareth to sell our sheep, our
goats and from them we get food

138
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We don't spend buying other things because here
we have what it takes

139
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
We have milk that animals give us, meat and
our own garden

140
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Where we plant grains, pumpkin corn and a little bit of everything

141
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Therefore, we do not suffer from anything here, but rather
otherwise we live well

142
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and we are fine

143
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
We do not have to be thinking about what we are going to
eat because we live well fortunately

144
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And as. If we have our own milk,
meat, fruits and others

145
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Unlike the city

146
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
If a young man goes to study in the city, he goes through
many needs

147
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
He begins to miss his territory and what
he fed here

148
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
On the other hand, in the city you must have money to
everything or else you will suffer

149
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Well, that's what those who have gone to study at the University have told us.

150
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Those who have already experienced it

151
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Because the others have not gone because there is no money or
rather because his mom doesn't have it

152
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
As soon as they finish high school they stay
just here and now

153
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Can you explain to me what are the sacred sites there?
and which ones are we going to see tomorrow?

154
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:54,000
One of the sacred sites is Wolunka from where
it's me, that's my territory

155
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Where does my mother come from and my grandmother is there

156
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Because where we are now belongs to my dad

157
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Uriana (Magalys's father's bloodline)

158
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I am Pausayu and my father Uriana

159
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Can you explain to me too, like tomorrow
we are going to some places

160
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What is the importance they have?

161
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You understand me? No.

162
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
He says that like tomorrow we are going to meet
some sacred sites

163
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
They would like to know the importance of these sacred sites

164
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Wolunka

165
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
According to the stories of the ancestors it was a woman

166
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That she had teeth in her vagina

167
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And there were also two young brothers

168
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Those who worried about leaving descendants.
They saw Wolunka when she bathed

169
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They saw the teeth in her vagina and they knew
that they couldn't even make her fall in love

170
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But they said they needed to leave descendants,
So they planned to knock out his teeth

171
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Where they knocked out his teeth, the water remained
reddish with Wolunka's blood

172
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You can also see the footprints and the stone from where you
they released the arrow, tomorrow we will see it

173
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
That is the origin of that sacred site because the
woman was called Wolunka

174
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Alewalu, where we go tomorrow is also sacred

175
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Because since ancient times they used to find
valuable stones

176
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
How tu'uma or other valuable stones they used
our ancestors

177
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That is why they also called it a sacred site.
because in it they found the most precious stones

178
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
To make the jewels that we have inherited
our ancestors

179
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Of the stones of alewalu

180
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Where are the waterfalls? Yeah. That's where our
lineage also, the Pausayu

181
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Since you already mentioned the others, could you
tell us about where the waterfalls are

182
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I have heard that they call it the eye of the water. Yes, because it is a big waterfall

183
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Could you tell us more about that place with the waterfalls?

184
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
A girl had an accident there years ago

185
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And Patsualu? It's the same one with the waterfalls too

186
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
They have to tell Geovanny to locate them well tomorrow

187
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You can describe the place where all the animals drink water,
which we will visit as well. You can describe it?

188
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
What is it and how important is it?

189
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
The importance to the community?

190
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It is because of that same water

191
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
All animals drink. That is, the one from the well

192
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Although before the water was extracted in an artisanal way

193
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But thanks to the alpina project energy was put
solar to drain water with motor

194
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The water is no longer drawn by hand, since that is how the
people suffered a lot

195
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Because they had to raise the bucket with water through
of a rope using only the strength of the arms

196
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Now it's just starting the engine and the water rises by itself
to give to all the animals

197
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
What is your dream with the community?
How would you like to see the community grow?

198
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
The first or main thing of all is what
I said a while ago

199
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
That in the community the energy returns through
she solar energy

200
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
So that the children can study, that they can
do your homework at night

201
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
That cell phones can be charged since now
It's their turn to go to Nazareth to load them

202
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So I want there to be energy

203
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
For us to be alright again

204
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
aha that's all

205
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You can also describe the Sawa'a (roasted corn
ground) that we just saw and ate

206
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
What is Sawa'a? and how is the process?

207
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Ah, the Sawa'a

208
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
That's what we eat

209
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It's like our sweets

210
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:50,000
First the corn is toasted, ground and added
panela to be delicious

211
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
That is our snack in a share or meeting

212
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
What is Sawa'a (sandstone)

213
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
A clear example is when a conflict is to be resolved

214
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Or solve a problem between different families

215
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
What is distributed during these meetings is the
Sawa'a to share among all

216
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Well, you living here in such a beautiful place,
I don't know if it has a connection with the mountains or with the
nature around you

217
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yes, of course, with the animals, more than anything, with the goats.

218
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
With the sheep, with the chickens

219
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
everything around me

220
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
As well as the garden that we make

221
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
That's all

222
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
They want to know something about spirituality
Of the territory

223
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
The old say that there is a spirituality of everything

224
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
In my community, for example, they say that through
From dreams they see the spirits of the mountains

225
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And the fishermen say that the sea has a
spirituality with some beings

226
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's because of sleep too. Yes, could you go a little deeper?
for our guests

227
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Why we should not ignore the spiritual connotation
of the holy places

228
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:07,000
The spirituality of the territory is through dreams,
if he tells us to play the Kasha (drum) we do

229
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:17,000
If it is to attract the father rain we touch it, if it is
to harmonize one day you also play

230
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So that nothing bad happens to us

231
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So that diseases and pests do not reach the community

232
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:37,000
If the earth starts to turn red, we already know that
we must play the kasha

233
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And make good food. All that the dream asks for

234
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Can you tell us who is mma'? or What is mma'?

235
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Mma' is the land, territory and our mother at the same time

236
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I wanted to ask you, for all the people who don't
They are Wayúu, which is what you would like us to learn from you.

237
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:26,000
From their community, from their grandchildren, from the children. What can we learn? Of what you are and of your practices

238
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Respect for our culture

239
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:41,000
that they recognize our value and that they do not make fun of
we for our clothing

240
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
They respect our culture

241
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
That you respect us rather

242
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Is it alright like this Neko? Yeah

243
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It's right

244
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
If you have a message that you would take to the world
what would?

245
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yes, that they respect and value our culture

246
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
That they recognize us and respect us in any
corner of the world

247
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Because our culture is wonderful in every way

248
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,000
We have diversity in crafts. AND
we respect those who are not wayúu

249
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So that there is mutual respect because, just as we respect them
we hope you respect us outside of here

250
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Don't make fun of us because of our clothes

251
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Because we respect the arijunas a lot
(someone who is not wayúu) when they arrive in the territory

252
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
We are kind to them, although I admit that we are not.
we are all like that

253
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:23,000
But, here in the north mutual respect is maintained
with ourselves and with the arijunas

254
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Well yes

255
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,000
When we went to India they said that the blanket was very
beautiful because we went in a blanket

256
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Ready? we're ready, we're done

257
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And be careful if you are going to download that because there is nowhere
load it. You saw that we returned to the same thing again.

258
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I wanted to ask you something else about spirituality and magic

259
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
What is magic for you?

260
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Spirituality manifests itself through sleep

261
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The Lania that is against

262
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
That that is revealed through the dream

263
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,000
The counter is a protection that is revealed through the dream

264
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
In the dream he tells someone "today this is going to happen to you"

265
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
But go there on the mountain where you will find such a plant

266
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You prepare it and bathe

267
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And that person has to fulfill what the dream asks for.
Because if you don't comply, something bad happens to you.

268
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And when he fulfills it, nothing happens to him

269
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Like the piachi (spiritualist) who has her spirituality
and their gifts

270
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Here previously there was an old lady who was the
children's piachi

271
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:01,000
She was the one who cured the children, but the lady has already passed away.

272
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
She also had her gifts her spirits

273
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:16,000
She asked for either animals, necklaces or whatever she asked for.

274
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And if they did not comply, the baby would not heal and she
she was also affected because she got sick

275
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
That's spirituality with dreams

276
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
That's how it is in our culture

277
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
What else? Other

278
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
The importance of water, what is it?

279
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's life, life

280
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It is essential for everyone, for humans and for animals.

281
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Without water there is no life, hence its importance to us.

282
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
But we thank God that as long as we have water

283
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And in Nazareth? In Nazareth yes, because we have a stream about 10 meters away

284
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Is where we're going now

285
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It is different than other parts. Yes, like there where we passed

286
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
That's why it's nice to live here, we don't lack anything, thank God

287
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And with the wind. yes you can breathe fresh air here

288
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Here the wind is very strong, you can tell me about the wind.
Yes because we are in summer

289
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:09,000
There is a drought, from the month of June, July and August

290
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
In September it suddenly starts to rain. the rain is coming

291
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
The wind has died down a bit

292
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:33,000
The wind also has a mythology in culture
wayúu or is a spirit or supernatural being

293
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I don't know much about that.

294
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
The wind is not necessary. Yes of course

295
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
our ancestors say

296
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
That in the beginning beings like the sun were created,
the moon and the wind is their brother

297
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
There are several types of winds, there is the normal one like that of
now and the whirlpool

298
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I don't know if you have any other information other than this.
No no I dont know

299
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Although they say that this represents hunger

300
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
My dad says that when there is a lot of wind it is
why are you hungry

301
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I mean, for them it's because there's a drought

302
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
There is summer and the animals no longer have to graze

303
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Because they get scared by this, when there is a lot of wind

304
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And the last thing you could tell us is how
How far are we from Uribia or Manaure?

305
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
How long does it take to get here?

306
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It's far, it's 6 or 7 hours in a good car

307
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
and more the sun

308
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It is a little removed and the path is a bit difficult

309
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And is there something else you want to share about your connection or your relationship with nature?

310
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
With the earth, with the animals, with the wind, the
water or with that place

311
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Well, here I am fine, I feel calm in peace

312
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I breathe that tranquility

313
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I don't feel stressed

314
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Peace is breathed here

315
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Very good anayawasu (thank you)

316
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Well I wanted to know about something so we're not done

317
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I wanted to know about the sun and the moon, I don't know if there are
mythologies about it

318
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Or what role does the sun or the moon have?

319
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
the moon yes

320
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
The moon when it approaches

321
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,000
The summer, the autumn that is on the moon

322
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:45,000
My dad always told me, "it's not going to rain, it's already
the moon on that side"

323
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Says it's getting closer and it's really raining

324
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
old men are wise

325
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
My dad always says like this "look, it's going to rain"

326
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
they, they

327
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
They watch the time with the moon

328
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
When it will rain, when it will not rain and when it will
be bad the rain

329
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
They say "no this year it will not rain well, because
the moon is on this side"

330
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It's wrong like that

331
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And I tell my dad how do you know that? he tells me
than looking at the moon

332
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
And so

333
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It's going to be bad the rain is going to rain a lot this year

334
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:51,000
What other things did your dad teach you? oh the song
of a bird that always sings around

335
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So some say, no this year will not see rain
Look what that bird is singing

336
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
What they say is true, it doesn't rain not enough

337
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Do the birds know? If the birds know, the old people, the grandparents too

338
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Of the sun if I don't know much Neko.

339
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
It is a sun that heats nothing else, it is used for energy

340
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Yes too

341
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And if there is no sun, there is no energy, they do not charge
cool batteries

342
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Here we always have that problem and don't even mention it
rainy times

343
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Because the sun does not rise, all the time is cloudy

344
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
What is your clan? And how important are the clans?

345
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
The clans are what represent us

346
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Since each family has a clan and an animal
that represents it, that is, they have their dowry

347
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
What is the clan mark?

348
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
And what is your clan and your brand?

349
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I am Pausayu

350
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
And the animal that represents me is the black wasp

351
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
with a cool king

352
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And my mark is like a

353
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Maye you can show them our brand

354
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Show them please, that's on the right blanket. Yeah

355
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
That's on the blanket, the mark

356
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Yes that. this one here

357
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Del Pausayu. I have it here on the forehead, if that's it.

358
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
That is the one that represents us

359
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Everyone has their importance for each family

360
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
They recognize him by that, where he is from or where he comes from

361
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I can have two brands on my animals

362
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I can take my dad's and I can put mine on that animal

363
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Here it is

364
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:28,000
This is my dad's, Uriana is this family's. and this is ours

365
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I mean, we can take this

366
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I can use this to mark a cow or cattle

367
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
We can mark this and this

368
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
So that they differentiate us like the Urianas

369
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
This is from a Pausayu

370
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Because we here are achon, that is, children of Uriana

371
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
How many clans do you see there? How many?

372
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Many? Yes, there are several, there is Pushaina, for example

373
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Arpushana, if there are several

374
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
How many animals do you have?

375
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Well, they are dying in my absence for a month over there

376
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Because they are careful, if the owner does not come

377
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
that also exists

378
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
'Cause they steal right here in the family, as you know
that one is not

379
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
They sell them

380
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
As they know that one is not there, but when one is here
don't mess with them

381
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Because one immediately follows the footprint, we follow it

382
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:21,000
That's why there's no robbery here, and if we know who it is
poor him because he has to pay double or triple

383
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
For one animal they have to pay ten

384
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
ten sheep

385
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
That takes away the desire to steal

386
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
That is why there is peace, because that is the payment for a lack

387
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
who wants to steal like that

388
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
You have to do it well hidden

389
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And that is why there is peace because there is a payment
for the faults

390
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And that is a wayúu system. Yeah

391
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:07,000
If there is no payment, there is a conflict, just as I told you that
the woman is the one who intervenes and so on.

392
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Like those countrymen from last night who formed us
a whole mess about it.

393
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:57,000
One time, just for introduction, you could tell where from
you are now what do you do

394
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I am Magalys Polanco, wayúu Pausayu

395
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And my ancestral territory is Isi'jou

396
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
What is in the Macuira, dune

397
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I am mother and grandmother

398
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And in my community I like to help people

399
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
As I was saying, I took the solar energy course,
I also like

400
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Because being in the community is not very good

401
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
One has to go to bed early if we are in the dark

402
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
On the other hand, with energy one goes to bed later
because there is light

403
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
We can do chores like knitting or reading

404
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And here in my house I work with the animals

405
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I take care of my goats, sheep, all the animals, the chickens

406
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And that's who I am in my community

407
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
And when people come here, I like to help them

408
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
and the book? Oh the book.

409
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Well we wrote a book with Juan David with the help of Neko

410
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
About energy and what I did in India

411
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Anayawasü (thank you) Jatsü (it's over).
