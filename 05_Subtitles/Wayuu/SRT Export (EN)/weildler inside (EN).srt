1
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:05,625
Good.

2
00:00:05,708 --> 00:00:07,041
Well,

3
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:10,041
first of all, if you could tell us.

4
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:12,625
If you could

5
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:13,791
Introduce yourself?

6
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:14,541
Yeah.

7
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:17,916
Well, my name is Weilder Guerra Curbelo,

8
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:21,250
I am an anthropologist from Universidad de Los Andes.

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,750
I am a member of the Wayuú people

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,416
and I have dedicated part of my academic life to studying

11
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:29,416
Their history and their society.

12
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:30,333
Very good.

13
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,333
And

14
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,166
well, first of all, for someone

15
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,083
who knows nothing about Wayuú people,

16
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:40,083
who are they and where are they located?

17
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,000
They are indigenous people

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,500
located at the north of South America, on the peninsula “La Güajira”

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,500
shared by Colombia and Venezuela.

20
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,666
They are the largest town in Colombia

21
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:54,500
and the largest indigenous people in Venezuela.

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,875
Their language is Wayuúnaiki and there’s an estimate of

23
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:01,000
some 800,000 of these individuals in both countries.

24
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:04,625
Ok. And

25
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,166
well,

26
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:10,458
and right now where are we?

27
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,041
We are

28
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:12,750
In Riohacha,

29
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,625
capital of the department La Güajira,

30
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,000
in the Colombian Republic.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,041
Very good.

32
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,125
And

33
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:23,125
well, for many years you have been

34
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,166
working with the Wayúu and you are Wayúu as well.

35
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,708
Can you tell me a little about your family and your work?

36
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,958
Well, my family is originally from a pearl fishing

37
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,166
region,

38
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:38,250
near El Cabo de la Vela, which is called Carrizal

39
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:41,833
and our territory is called Manuyalu'u

40
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:45,958
which is a territory inhabited by my ancestors

41
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:49,458
since the end of the 19th century.

42
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,875
Okay.

43
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:55,375
And the work

44
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:59,875
that you have done, more than anything you are a teacher, but also

45
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,958
Have you done other things, other professions?

46
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes, I have served as a public official

47
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,166
at least on two occasions,

48
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,625
as Secretary of Indigenous Affairs,

49
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,500
as governor in charge of La Güajira,

50
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,708
as director of the Colombian Caribbean Observatory,

51
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:19,166
what is a research center

52
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:22,166
and as manager of the Colombian Central Bank

53
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,333
in the “San Andrés” archipelago

54
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,958
and in the La Güajira department.

55
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,166
And

56
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,750
well, as we have been talking

57
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,083
the other day about the Wayuú’s ontology

58
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,166
and nature

59
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,208
of the earth, what relationship does it have?

60
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,208
I mean, we know it's no different,

61
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,791
but explain that to me.

62
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,708
well, the Wayuú have an ontological conception

63
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:51,250
in which we must first understand the notion of time,

64
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,000
they have a notion of time

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,041
in which the substance of all life was humanity,

66
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,041
the stars were human, the wind,

67
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:02,041
the current hills, the animals,

68
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,458
the plants.

69
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,750
All these beings were human, there were social institutions

70
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,791
and they communicated throughout human language.

71
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:14,291
There was already kinship, agriculture, weaving, music,

72
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:18,041
war, all human institutions and practices.

73
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,875
But the world was undifferentiated,

74
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,875
It had only one form, one substance.

75
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,666
Then comes a transformative

76
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:30,958
time, several events shape the universe

77
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,166
and all beings begin to change.

78
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:37,125
Many humans become hills,

79
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,125
others become plants, others become animals.

80
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:41,833
And in general,

81
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:45,291
The only non-transformed beings are current humans.

82
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,750
This morphological differentiation

83
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,541
allows us to move into the current world.

84
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:55,125
However, those beings that today have a different form,

85
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,125
a different taxation,

86
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,875
They retain a residual humanity

87
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,958
and a point of view on the universe,

88
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,583
because they were human in the past,

89
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,708
then they are fallen humans or ex-humans.

90
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,750
So they have a voice

91
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,750
or do they have a story to tell?

92
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,208
They have a story to tell,

93
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:19,208
but they no longer have human language to communicate.

94
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,875
They have a desire to show themselves in the world,

95
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,708
plants through flowering,

96
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:28,041
of fruiting, of expanding its leaves,

97
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,458
animals to act as such, to behave.

98
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,500
and to them

99
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,916
we owe them the transmission of knowledge,

100
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,250
to plants and humans

101
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,416
weaving, agriculture, war,

102
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,833
justice, rules.

103
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:47,041
Everything depends on those mythological beings,

104
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,625
that live in the current world, but in the past

105
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,208
They were and continue to be our cosmic relatives.

106
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,750
So can you talk a bit about that relationship that the Wayúu has

107
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,625
with their own

108
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,208
elements

109
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,333
and characters.

110
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,625
How in referential time

111
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,625
called wayúu Sumaiwa (old) or wayuú Jumaiwa (old),

112
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,916
They were humans, they had clans,

113
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,791
Therefore, today they also have clans.

114
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:21,500
So the jaguar, the cat, the wild pig,

115
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,291
certain birds, certain bees

116
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,875
They have clans because they had them

117
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,875
in the past, therefore they are still related.

118
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:35,083
These clans not only refer to that time,

119
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,208
but social attributes

120
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,458
like being numerous, being brave, being cunning,

121
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:44,250
be meek, be hardworking, be united.

122
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,041
All those social attributes

123
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,000
are shared by humans and animals

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,416
and it's a way of somehow organizing the world,

125
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,958
but through a metonymic vision of the world,

126
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,083
which is the sharing of social attributes.

127
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,083
We're going to talk more about that in a bit,

128
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,125
but I also wanted

129
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:08,291
ask about the history of the people, that is

130
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,833
because I know that they were not colonized, they are the

131
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:15,125
only non-colonized people or nation.

132
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,291
Yes, Wayuú are people that,

133
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,291
They are a maritime people from the Caribbean

134
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,375
That adopted cattle in the 16th century

135
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,916
They transition to pastoralism,

136
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,583
from being hunters,

137
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,958
fishermen, horticulturists, fruit collectors.

138
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:36,041
This whole set of groups that today we call Wayuú

139
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:40,000
They adopted cattle as a way of life

140
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,208
and they took horses, donkeys, cows,

141
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,958
goats and sheep and made a transition to pastoralism.

142
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,083
A large part of the population,

143
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,166
a part of that population on the coast

144
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:56,125
were dedicated to fishing and therefore also

145
00:06:56,125 --> 00:07:00,666
They appropriated navigation techniques, engines, fishing nets

146
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,708
who were from the Western culture and so too

147
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,958
They strengthened their economic activities on the coast,

148
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,916
but they also crossed empires, they went to Jamaica,

149
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,416
They went to the French keys,

150
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,416
Traveled to the Dutch possessions of Aruba,

151
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,625
Curaçao, Bonaire,

152
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,583
throughout the Dutch Caribbean and other Caribbean ports.

153
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,625
This allowed them

154
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:27,166
cross several empires and have an open mind,

155
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,791
conceive maps of the world, a very extensive geography,

156
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,125
very wide,

157
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:36,458
and see the world beyond the jurisdiction of

158
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,708
the Spanish monarchy.

159
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,750
That is why they are trans-imperial historical subjects.

160
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,583
When they arrive to the Colombian Republic

161
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,041
These ties were cut

162
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:47,583
and the wayuú

163
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:51,291
were trapped in their peninsula, circumscribed

164
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,666
to the jurisdiction of the Republic of Colombia.

165
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,250
Interesting.

166
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,291
And before that, I think I had also read that never

167
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,375
were conquered or colonized.
The Wayuú were not

168
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,375
subjugated,

169
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,416
They always rebelled against any form

170
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:10,458
Of limitation to their political autonomy.

171
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:14,833
To give an example, in 1769

172
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,916
They revolted against the Spanish crown on May 2

173
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,291
and in a war that lasted more than four years,

174
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,916
They burned many Spaniards villages,

175
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:28,000
defeated the Spanish military forces,

176
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,458
They killed missionaries, they destroyed churches

177
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:35,166
and that is known as the May 69 uprising.

178
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,166
In 1752

179
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:38,875
they had done

180
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:39,875
formal agreements

181
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,291
with the Republic of Holland

182
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,333
to protect Dutch trade

183
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,458
In the güajiro ports, they were historical subjects

184
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:50,083
collectives, capable of protecting their territory.

185
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,375
So, this people have been a people that has

186
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,750
resisted those forms of external domination

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,833
Today it has two republics that control its territory

188
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,958
and they divided it, which are Venezuela and Colombia.

189
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,708
And

190
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,708
following that, that is, as

191
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,083
nan

192
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,750
well, can you tell me a little about your justice system?

193
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,541
with the palabrero.

194
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,583
The Wayúu have a justice system

195
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,583
based on rhetoric

196
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,583
and in persuasion and compensation.

197
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:35,250
Any physical offense, any aggression or any moral affront

198
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,333
that one person causes another, voluntary

199
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,333
or involuntarily, must be compensated.

200
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,500
This compensation is not requested directly,

201
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,500
but through specialists, called Pütchipü

202
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,458
or palabrero, and the compensation

203
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,916
is not delivered to the victim,

204
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,208
but to the relatives of the victim.

205
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,125
This norm is called sukuaipa wayuu, which means

206
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,125
the güajiro way of doing things,

207
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,125
and these elements that are given are cattle,

208
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,125
necklaces, animals, and weapons.

209
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,541
Lately money,

210
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,625
but money was not in the tradition

211
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,791
Where money is involved, it goes like cattle or like a necklace.

212
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,625
Did they use barter a lot?

213
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,208
They exchanged things

214
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,875
but also the money, because the Wayúu first

215
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,541
They exported pearls, they exchanged pearls for weapons,

216
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,541
for food, for fabric, for metal objects,

217
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,125
Brazilwood,

218
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,958
cowhide, cattle with the English, a lot of cattle

219
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,708
divi-divi, and other elements,

220
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,791
all this until the 19th and early 20th centuries.

221
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,916
And you told me that your family

222
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,791
did they start with that pearl collecting?

223
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,750
Is that still going on?
No.

224
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,791
Pearls were very important in life in La Güajira

225
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:57,500
in the 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries,

226
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:01,083
but the Japanese introduced pearl farming,

227
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,416
with which the pearl dived,

228
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,875
which was already more difficult to obtain, which required

229
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,875
a lot of human effort and not the cultivated one,

230
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:14,208
fell somehow as an activity

231
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:18,416
and therefore today the Wayuú do not fish for pearls,

232
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,041
although the pearl banks are

233
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,708
full in La Güajira’s sea.

234
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:24,500
Interesting,

235
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,500
didn't know that.

236
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:31,041
Well,

237
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,416
can you talk to me

238
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:36,291
a bit about dreams and the importance they have

239
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,500
dreams in the Wayúu culture?

240
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,583
Dreams are prescriptive in the Wayúu world.

241
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,916
It's called Lapü,

242
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:48,166
Lapü is a character, he generates the dream

243
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,083
Himself. He’s so powerful that when cultural heroes,

244
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,416
Wayúu semi-divine figures

245
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,708
like Maleiwa dream, they have to obey the dream.

246
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:01,250
So dreams are instructions for every living being.

247
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,666
It is not discussed.

248
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,750
The dream can order the sacrifice of animals,

249
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,333
sleep can order confinement

250
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,958
of some people, rituals,

251
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,541
different decisions and you have to obey them.

252
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:16,291
Dream governs much of Wayúu life,

253
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,583
the dreamlike is fundamental.

254
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,500
One wayúu can ask the other

255
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,208
the next day

256
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,208
When they wake up, “what did you dream of?” instead of “good morning!”

257
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,958
Nice.

258
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:32,375
And that brings me a bit to the idea of a world

259
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,041
Nazu versus the Ulazu

260
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,541
how the visible and non-visible world.

261
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,416
Yes, it's because the dream

262
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,416
It is a bridge that allows us to communicate,

263
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:48,541
for example, with corn, with beans, with pumpkin,

264
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,125
with these ex humans

265
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:53,083
and see them in the dream with their original appearance,

266
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,208
not like today's vegetables,

267
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,916
but like the humans they were in the past.

268
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,375
The dream is revealing,

269
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,375
can announce you

270
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:05,166
happy or tragic events in the life of a family group.

271
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,500
Interesting.

272
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,125
Well,

273
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,166
can you explain me about.

274
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,208
Well, two things. One,

275
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,208
What has recently happened with the

276
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:21,750
hydrogen generators? and also

277
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,250
with that topic

278
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,208
linked is obviously the wind,

279
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,375
What is this ontological conflict that is happening there?

280
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,041
La Güajira

281
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,500
is a region located in the north of Colombia that has

282
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,500
many natural resources, coal.

283
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,583
That's why there are very powerful mining companies here,

284
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,708
gas, that's why

285
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:44,166
Texaco, Chevron, all these companies have been here.

286
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,500
It also has

287
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,458
salt in abundance and that’s why it has been the first producer of

288
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,500
Salt of the country.

289
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,500
And now, a renewable energy bonanza is coming

290
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,500
based on solar luminosity,

291
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,833
but mainly in the wind.

292
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:01,625
These companies

293
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,916
They are arriving in Colombia

294
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,166
or to La Güajira along with the Government

295
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,833
to make an Energy transition,

296
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:11,708
But practices can continue to be extractive.

297
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:12,625
I mean,

298
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,458
They are called “clean energies”,

299
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,541
but in the relationship with the communities

300
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,250
They can rely on behaviors that are the same

301
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,500
to those of the old companies.

302
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,416
So, at this moment there are ontological conflicts

303
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:29,416
between the Wayúu people and those companies,

304
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:33,416
Because they don't understand how the Wayúu see the world,

305
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:37,208
how the Wayúu see the winds: They see them as plural beings,

306
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,708
ambiguous, which can be masculine or feminine,

307
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:44,333
that have no fixed place, but paths through which they cross,

308
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,750
that are related to well-being,

309
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,000
with certain elements of life

310
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,583
and therefore the vision is not understood

311
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,333
who sees the wind as a business, as an air mass

312
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,625
hot, like inanimate geophysical agents,

313
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,500
of this Wayuú’s vision

314
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,875
who see them as beings with the capacity for agency,

315
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,291
with reflexivity and with a moral code.

316
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,250
And that's why there was a conflict?

317
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,250
And what happened to the recent companies?

318
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,500
What has happened lately is that some companies

319
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,041
who do not know the social organization,

320
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,250
Wayúu territorial rights,

321
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,583
They reached some areas,

322
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,375
they made some quick questions

323
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,500
and then the projects began to be built,

324
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,250
but the underlying conflicts that were there and the

325
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,333
Lack of understanding

326
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:37,250
with the Wayúu social environment, has led to blockades,

327
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,666
The differences between the Wayúu population and companies.

328
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:41,791
And one of them,

329
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,791
in Green Power, decided to abandon his project.

330
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,708
Right now,

331
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,833
the president of La Güajira

332
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,041
is here

333
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,291
to rebuild those relationships

334
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,291
and try to generate an agreement

335
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,000
among indigenous peoples

336
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,500
and those renewable energy projects.

337
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,958
And for you, what steps need to be taken?

338
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:05,125
to reach an agreement like this between the people and the government?

339
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,583
A set of rules, the first thing the government

340
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,750
Has to do is to establish a set of rules that enforce

341
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,750
Indigenous and communities rights.

342
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,625
So companies do not see the Wayúu territory

343
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,916
like a national wasteland, like a land without an owner, it is a

344
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,916
constitutionally protected reservation.

345
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,958
It has 1,070,000 hectares, therefore large.

346
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,041
But the Wayuú

347
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:33,041
They have notions of territory that must be respected,

348
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:36,375
They have notions of social organization, of family

349
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,875
and notions of rights and territorial control

350
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:44,166
and ontological that these companies must know

351
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,750
and understand. When they talk to the Wayuú, when they understand

352
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,625
how this society thinks and what its norms are like,

353
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,500
then there could be an understandable dialogue between the two.

354
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,625
One has a commercial logic,

355
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,333
the others have their own ontological mission.

356
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,666
Bringing that closer is key.

357
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,833
Now, the indigenous people are economic subjects, that is,

358
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,875
They have valid, legitimate expectations and interests.

359
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,708
Therefore, companies see it as Rousseau beings,

360
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,708
like the noble savage who does not aspire for money

361
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:15,875
nor can he aspire to money

362
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,875
because it contaminates his condition as a noble savage.

363
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,291
It is different from the Wayúu, who crossed Empires

364
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:27,250
to carry contraband, merchandise, to Holland, to Jamaica.

365
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:31,416
So that’s ignoring their history as an maritime indigenous people

366
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,041
Yes, of course.

367
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:39,083
And that's talking about the norms of the Wayúu people,

368
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,958
Maybe a very important one is the matrilineal.

369
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:45,708
Definitely.

370
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,083
What they must understand

371
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,375
is that in the Wayúu territoriality

372
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,666
lands are inherited from the uterine side,

373
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,208
on the maternal side,

374
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:56,125
for what the Wayúu call Wapushi, our family,

375
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,250
and therefore sometimes they can be left to children

376
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,375
living in the territory without having the right

377
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:06,416
to decide. These companies

378
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,625
they reach the territories

379
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,625
and talk to the first person they find,

380
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,375
thinking that because they live there

381
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,208
They are the owners of the territory.

382
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:17,208
It turns out that it is not like that and it is not usually like that.

383
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,791
Someone can live far away without having

384
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,333
that presence

385
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,333
in the occupation of the land and that belonging.

386
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,375
There have been many disagreements in two

387
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,875
logics of seeing the world, two ways of seeing the universe.

388
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:32,291
Sure

389
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,291
and that is I think the axis of everything.

390
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,625
Definitely.

391
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,166
And for someone who doesn't know

392
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:42,166
what is an ontology and what is ontology,

393
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:45,458
so as a summary

394
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,208
of the Wayúu people or summarized.
Correct.

395
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,000
Well, ontology is the science of

396
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,750
The being in all human lives

397
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,625
and it is a field of philosophy and metaphysics.

398
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,750
But,

399
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,291
Well, anthropology has been very interested

400
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,208
for the ways

401
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,583
in which human societies

402
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,333
give signficance to the universe.

403
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,333
How they classify the stars, the winds,

404
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:12,166
vegetation, animals, other non-human beings.

405
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,125
And find knowledge and ways

406
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,416
of conceiving time and beings very sophisticated.

407
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,375
Not only taxonomy, categorization principles,

408
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,000
ways of relating to non-humans,

409
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,166
modes of classification and categorization.

410
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,250
So the Wayuú

411
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,541
They are a people who first of all consider

412
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:40,375
that many non-humans were humans in the past.

413
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,125
Therefore,

414
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,958
They have a residual humanity

415
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,625
that inhabits them and are relatives.

416
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,583
They are not inanimate beings.

417
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,750
A fishing company can see many fish

418
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,375
per metric tons of production, a stock.

419
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,375
The Wayuú see them as relatives,

420
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,958
They don't see it from instrumental mathematics,

421
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,708
but sees them from kinship.

422
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,291
It’s another type of.

423
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,208
Well, science as we know in the West

424
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,375
is a type of

425
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,375
science, a type of knowing a world.

426
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:15,125
Well, the Wayúu has that, as they say, like complex

427
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:20,791
and full of important, small, big things.

428
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,208
Exact. The deep difference

429
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,375
the ontological separation

430
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,375
among humanity

431
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:33,291
and non-humans is very deep in the West.

432
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,083
In these type of communities

433
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,083
as the wayúu is not so deep and they can be

434
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,166
closer to some non-humans than to some humans,

435
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,500
because these non-humans are their relatives

436
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,708
and they were humans in the past and have social attributes

437
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,333
that are shared.

438
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:53,708
The Wayuú do not see other beings as natural strangers,

439
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,875
but as relatives who in the past were

440
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,291
and the world more than in its creation,

441
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:05,125
They see it as a modeling and a transformation.

442
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:06,875
Focus on transformative events

443
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,708
and they believe that the world is subject to modeling,

444
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,583
because Mma, the Earth,

445
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,875
which is the mother of all living beings, is mysterious,

446
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,291
and therefore has the capacity

447
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:21,291
to transform the beings that inhabit it.

448
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,708
Tell me a little about that, about the transformation, the Mma

449
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,708
and how he was telling me that she is mysterious, but also

450
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:34,250
is not 100% righteous, because she is also a human.

451
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:39,166
Yes, Mma (Earth), as in principle she is seen as human in that

452
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,000
referential time,

453
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,208
that referential order of things

454
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,375
She is the sister of Palaa, the Sea.

455
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,041
Then Mma every so often

456
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,041
It has conflicts with the Sea, and the Sea invades it

457
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,250
and then the Earth

458
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,416
and the beings of the Earth

459
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:57,583
They have to use torches and fire to make her come back

460
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,041
to its limits and its initial shores.

461
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,208
But in that flooding process

462
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,291
there is a transformation of beings.

463
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,666
So life is in a continuous transformation

464
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:13,333
And those transformative events are very important

465
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,875
for peoples like the Wayúu,

466
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,875
who are very aware of that.

467
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,625
What matters for the Wayúu is not

468
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:24,083
when an event occurred, but rather that the event occurred.

469
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,791
Out of those events, there are transformations in the landscape

470
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:31,708
a rock, some drawings, a mirage,

471
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:35,958
a hill or hills that have distinctive features.

472
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,500
That is why for the Wayúu the territory is an open book,

473
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,750
because it is the stage where the events occur,

474
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,916
the events that shape beings.

475
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,500
Can you tell me about two things, one

476
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,208
a bit more about how land or a territory

477
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,375
it’s a book?

478
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:57,333
And related to that, what subjects,

479
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:58,875
which ones

480
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,875
chapters we find in that,

481
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,541
That book?

482
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:06,541
Many hills, the hills that make up La Güajira,

483
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,791
They were humans who traveled,

484
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:11,666
They traveled through the güajiro territory,

485
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:14,666
some stayed in it and became a hill

486
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:16,000
Due to thirst,

487
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,458
because they got lost, because they found love,

488
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,625
as in the case of Kamaishi,

489
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:24,458
The case of Episcua, Sosopo, Iitüjo´i.

490
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:27,458
The monks as well, Walirajau,

491
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:30,125
that are in the sea, in the gulf with Venezuela,

492
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,250
all the hills have a story,

493
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,541
Pa´ntui in Cabo de la Vela

494
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:37,583
and that history shapes the territory,

495
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,125
shaping the landscape

496
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:42,125
As they were frozen footprints of the ancestors.

497
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,666
Therefore, seeing a landscape, seeing a hill, seeing a rock,

498
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,458
is to evoke stories,

499
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:51,166
stories interconnected with other places that form

500
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:54,916
that intelligible text of life that is the landscape.

501
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:58,291
Those movements, those traces of the ancestors.

502
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,375
So, that's why the territory

503
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,833
It is so important for the Wayuú.

504
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,708
Each of these places has a tale.

505
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,541
How it was transformed

506
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:10,541
why this hill came and found a female wind

507
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:14,083
and fell in love with her and his cattle went to the sea like Kamaishi

508
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,916
and therefore, it regulates the things of the sea.

509
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:19,875
As another regulated

510
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,166
agriculture, as another was a shepherd in the past.

511
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,875
All these things explain how the world works.

512
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,541
and they give meaning to the universe.

513
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:29,958
Can you explain to me or

514
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,083
tell how the most important

515
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:36,083
hills and shapes

516
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:39,500
non-human or ex-human

517
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,250
of the territory

518
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,250
and maybe a bit about their...

519
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,416
character or how they were like?

520
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:51,000
Yes, I can tell the story of Kamaishi

521
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:55,333
or Epitsu, they are two sister hills, they are three hills.

522
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:58,333
The older brother was in Macuira, Iitüjo'i.

523
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,083
Once upon a time,

524
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:02,125
With a very intense summer, he told his brothers

525
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:03,500
that the land

526
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,500
was not enough for the herd of the three

527
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:09,541
Then they both left

528
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,291
towards the base of the peninsula to search for land

529
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:14,875
and then one of them

530
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:17,875
He reached Cabo de la Vela, near Cabo de la Vela.

531
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:19,250
Over there,

532
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,333
While he was with his animals, a woman named Jepiraichi passed by.

533
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:25,166
This woman asked him what he came for.

534
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:28,166
He told him, I've come to seek land for my herd.

535
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,750
She left

536
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,750
and returned in the evening and brought him fish to eat,

537
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:36,083
delicious fish to eat, snapper, grouper.

538
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:39,500
And then he asked her if she lived there.

539
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,166
She told him that she didn’t live here, but she would passed by.

540
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,250
The winds do not live in one place,

541
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,250
the winds pass through the places, they fell in love

542
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:50,583
and all Kamaishi's herd ended up in the Sea

543
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:53,666
and they are many of the fish we have today.

544
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:57,791
The other brother went to where his place is today,

545
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:01,500
He met a wind woman called Arüleshi

546
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,208
and she asked him what he was doing.

547
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:04,875
He told her what he was doing

548
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:07,875
and she returned in the evening with corn,

549
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:11,125
beans, pumpkin, cassava, food.

550
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,583
And then the two fell in love and this man became

551
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:19,000
Who, in some way, influences

552
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,708
the food on Earth.

553
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,291
So there it stayed and became a hill

554
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:26,208
and it is the hill that

555
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:30,125
we know today. That triad of brother hills,

556
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:33,166
They are a territorial arrangement,

557
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:35,041
of economic activities

558
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:38,041
of the territory written from a referential time.

559
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,916
Interesting.

560
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:41,333
Well, I

561
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,000
I think at one point,

562
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,333
we want you to maybe give us a little tour of

563
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,500
your books and also the room and

564
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
the painting there and can you tell me

565
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,333
which room or house are we in now?

566
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,083
Of course. Well, it’s my house.

567
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:04,041
This is my house that I am just building,

568
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:07,083
It's not finished,

569
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,083
but hey, I'm building it just the way I like it

570
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:12,708
like a enrramada Wayúu open to the winds.

571
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:13,958
Yes.

572
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:15,875
Tell me a little about that architecture.

573
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:18,708
Is it anything like the original?

574
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:21,708
Yes, it is very original and it is open.

575
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,583
This is a girl in the

576
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,291
confinement, to the Wayúu girls,

577
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:26,375
When they experience their first menstruation they lock them up

578
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:30,458
and she spends months there, learning how to knit,

579
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:34,250
who is her family, learning how to think, her grandmother, her mother, her aunts,

580
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:35,458
They are going to teach it.

581
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:38,500
And that's what she's doing there. She’s in limbo

582
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:42,375
She is neither a girl nor a woman, she is like a chrysalis.

583
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:44,791
When she comes out, she comes out as a woman.

584
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:47,333
Can you tell me a

585
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:50,333
bit of this cane

586
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:53,500
and

587
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:53,958
what is it?

588
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:56,958
And also, can you also explain to me about the graph down there?

589
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:07,916
This cane is a wararat or Wayúu palabrero cane,

590
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:11,333
It is the one he uses to carry the word,

591
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:15,875
It is a support point for the body, a support point for memory.

592
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,208
It serves to point out someone in a process,

593
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:21,375
You can't point your finger at it.

594
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:23,875
Used to draw in the sand

595
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:27,208
and to retain memory of the arguments

596
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:29,458
That is he giving to the other party.

597
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:33,333
This is the ground connection point,

598
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:37,125
The Earth can convey through the message he must give.

599
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:40,208
This is the weapon of the palabrero, because with this

600
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:43,208
He defends himself against the dogs that bark on the roads.

601
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:45,875
So these are the roles of the cane.

602
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:48,541
This bird is called Utta,

603
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:51,875
He was the first palabrero that existed in mythological times

604
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:55,000
and he was the one who gave it to humans

605
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,708
the principles of life, of the law on Earth,

606
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:58,958
of the standards.

607
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:02,083
And then the palabreros, who are they?

608
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:02,583
What do they do?

609
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:06,000
What is their role?
The role of palabreros is to be intermediaries,

610
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:09,583
rhetoric specialists who know the Wayúu laws

611
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,125
and mediate family disputes.

612
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:17,125
Their role is to bring them to a peaceful settlement

613
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:20,125
since they obtain compensation.

614
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:24,375
It is the persuasive rhetoric that leads to peace.

615
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:27,416
The cane is the vehicle of the word.

616
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:29,083
It is known as this.

617
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:32,083
That is the role and meaning that these canes have.

618
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:33,083
And the,

619
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,250
That system is not criminal, right?

620
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,750
Is it a restorative system?
It is a non-punitive restorative system,

621
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,583
because it does not seek to punish anyone, it seeks to compensate

622
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:45,750
the fault committed

623
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,333
through material

624
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:48,041
and aesthetic elements

625
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:51,958
like cattle, collars, even hand over the firearm

626
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:55,333
that has caused a death, for example.

627
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:58,250
In order to seek restoration

628
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,958
of family relationships

629
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,166
between families that are in dispute,

630
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:05,208
not between two individuals, between sets

631
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:08,208
relatives of those two individuals.

632
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:11,500
And can you show me the symbol here?

633
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,541
Here we have at the base of the cane,

634
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,583
In this particular cane, there are many types of canes

635
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:21,583
and they can be different, even made of different woods.

636
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:26,416
The clan, the clan emblem of my, of my Uriana clan

637
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,291
Yes, that is the iron or clan emblem

638
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:39,541
Do you consider yourself a palabrero?

639
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:43,583
No. Even though I have solved 223

640
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:47,041
conflicts, throughout that,

641
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:49,666
when I was Secretary of indigenous affairs,

642
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:52,666
but I don't consider it because the word palabrero

643
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:55,666
It means pütchipü, a person whose job is to speak.

644
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:59,166
But there are words in a wayúnaiki like pütcheje'chi and

645
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:02,000
is that sometimes settle disputes or Pütchejana,

646
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
which is the messenger.

647
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,166
So, I have intervened in many Wayúu disputes

648
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:09,541
trying to mediate, but it's not my job.

649
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:11,291
Okay.

650
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:14,291
Can you show me that book,

651
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:18,875
“El Cimarrón”?

652
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:20,416
This book,

653
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:23,958
It is a book of my authorship called El Mar Cimarrón,

654
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:27,958
that explains the relationships of the Wayúu with the sea,

655
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:31,375
their conceptualizations, their navigation ways,

656
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:34,583
the relationship with fish, with turtles,

657
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:35,583
with shrimp,

658
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:37,750
with all marine beings, but also

659
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,208
the landscape backgrounds in the sea,

660
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,750
What are seascapes called?

661
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,375
How they classify them,

662
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:47,166
how they navigate and how they navigate through the stars,

663
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:50,666
the constellations, the techniques, the fishing nets.

664
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,166
Tries to explain the Wayúu system,

665
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:57,166
in which fishing is marine cattle

666
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:01,458
and therefore there is a relationship of the Wayuú

667
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,250
with those marine cattle.

668
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,458
The sea is like a meadow, an immense meadow

669
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,250
where there are cattle and that animal,

670
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,333
those cattle are the fish.

671
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,375
And the symbols?

672
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:14,458
This symbol is called jimeuiya,

673
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:16,791
It means like the eye of the fish.

674
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:19,500
It is in the Wayuú fabric, it is in

675
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,958
Much of the Wayúu fabric are symbols of the sea.

676
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:26,416
There are many other symbols of the sea that can be

677
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:29,791
present in ceramics,

678
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:32,791
not only in the fabric and

679
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:35,708
All these symbols are very important.

680
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:38,708
Here, for example, we have

681
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:41,666
the snail, the crab,

682
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:43,250
this is in wayúu ceramics

683
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,250
and these are canoe decorations, they are painted,

684
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,125
the canoes are made up like a flirtatious woman,

685
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:50,291
in fact it is called süchepa.

686
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:52,291
The makeup of the canoe,

687
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:53,416
It is the face of the canoe

688
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:55,250
That it adorned like a woman,

689
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,791
Therefore the canoe is also painted and we can see it

690
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:02,458
in the boats, in the different Wayúu boats.

691
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:05,833
That canoe makeup.

692
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:10,041
Yes, we can, we can see in the boats,

693
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,458
which is an ornament.

694
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:13,875
Yes Yes.

695
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:16,041
This is.

696
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:19,041
I don't know if there is another book that you want to show us.

697
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:21,500
Well, this is my book of dispute (laughs)

698
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,333
well this is a book

699
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:29,500
about the Wayúu law and here we see the bird

700
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,458
Utta who is also the first palabrero, the first pütchipü.

701
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,166
and this book

702
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:38,166
won the national prize for Culture in Colombia for Anthropology

703
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,958
in the year 2000-2001

704
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:43,958
and well, it was the first book I published

705
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,041
and it has to do with all

706
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:50,041
Wayúu palabreros and the Wayuú regulatory system.

707
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,958
Here are the great palabreros of La Guajira.

708
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:55,000
Many of these have already died,

709
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
They existed and were very prestigious.

710
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:01,750
Yeah.

711
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:16,000
Here we have pulo'i de mar (of the Sea),

712
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:20,500
Pulo'i de mar is the owner of the sea animals, she is very rich.

713
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:24,208
To be able to access sea animals

714
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:28,541
you have to give her some, do some rituals

715
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:29,708
in which it is provided

716
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:34,291
an aromatic resin called malambo, malambo in wayunaiki

717
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:36,208
is called Alo'uka

718
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:38,625
That malambo is also used by divers

719
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:41,625
here to throw it when the sharks are around.

720
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,291
If a person overfishes, she punishes them.

721
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:48,708
That's why she doesn't like small turtles.

722
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:51,958
nor abuse the fish, but take what is necessary

723
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,250
to feed and to provide their family,

724
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:58,125
but without abusing it, because those fish

725
00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,708
They are not from the fishermen,

726
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:01,416
They are her cattle, of pulo'i (spirit) of the sea.

727
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:06,250
is this here?

728
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,291
Familiar? Yeah.

729
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:14,583
Well, I wanted to know

730
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:17,583
of the origin of the Wayúu people,

731
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,625
where they have always been from, here?

732
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:21,416
Correct.

733
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:24,291
on the peninsula or?

734
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:35,125
Well,

735
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:35,833
the wayuú people

736
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:37,375
speaks a language

737
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:40,833
which belongs to the Arawak language family.

738
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:44,875
The Arawak language family is an Amazonian family.

739
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:49,208
Therefore,

740
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:52,291
We know that the Wayúu migrated like many peoples

741
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:55,291
who occupied the Caribbean, like the Taínos,

742
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:58,541
like the Caquetíos, who also had Amazonian languages.

743
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:02,333
Some of the Wayúu practices

744
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:06,750
fishing with traps have Amazonian features.

745
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,750
Much of its mythology is full of jaguar,

746
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,833
of elements of that class and therefore it would seem

747
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:17,208
that like many other towns that arrived

748
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:19,166
the Caribbean have that origin.

749
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:22,333
However, paleo archeologist and linguistics

750
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:26,791
studies will have to show that, what that relationship is.

751
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:29,833
But they are different from the language family

752
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:33,166
of the people of the Sierra, who are a linguistic family

753
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:36,166
chibcha, which come from Central America.

754
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:39,250
Ok, so it's more likely that they came from the Amazon?

755
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,666
It is more likely,

756
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:44,666
in a process lasting many centuries

757
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,375
and whether through the Orinoco,

758
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,083
either through the Llanos,

759
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:51,416
but they surely reached the peninsula.

760
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:54,916
It is a process of centuries that archeology, linguistics

761
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:56,666
will have to

762
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:59,791
solve and study more clearly over time.

763
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:03,583
And

764
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:06,541
that one,

765
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:10,208
the Wayuú

766
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:12,541
well,

767
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:15,541
they live in an almost desert place

768
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:18,333
Obviously there are

769
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:21,333
many reasons, because one cannot move,

770
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,291
but is there a reason why they have stayed here or why

771
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:28,583
do you keep that specific place?

772
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:32,166
Well, like every human society, the Wayúu appropriated

773
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:35,958
this territory, they dispersed throughout that territory

774
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:40,000
and established an intimate relationship with this territory

775
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:43,291
and I would say, with the different places

776
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:46,916
that each family group considers its origin

777
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:50,000
and to which it is associated, linked,

778
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,791
through cemeteries, water sources, subsistence areas

779
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:59,083
such as the sea or areas of pasture or animal hunting

780
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:03,166
and the Wayúu have an intense relationship with those places.

781
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:07,541
That's why they talk about ekii, territorial heads

782
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:11,583
through which they came into the world, territorial roots

783
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,875
where they consider themselves to have gone out into the world.

784
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:17,125
There is an ontology of place

785
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:20,375
and many times the Wayúu have an immense relationship,

786
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:23,250
almost always with that place

787
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,916
which is what in some way gives rise to life.

788
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:29,875
And it is, speaking of that a little bit of that,

789
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:33,291
can you tell me about the cemetery and the importance of

790
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:36,333
for you?

791
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,750
Well, family groups

792
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,583
They have a principle they call precedence.

793
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:43,083
The precedence is that in a territory

794
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:44,750
There are those who arrived first,

795
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,750
hundreds of years ago or dozens of years ago

796
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:50,791
and they began to found the houses,

797
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:53,708
water sources, roses for agriculture,

798
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:55,208
agricultural areas

799
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:58,416
and since they have died, the cemetery is accumulating

800
00:39:58,916 --> 00:40:01,375
in the sequence of generations

801
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:04,000
that are a pact with the territory.

802
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,875
To offer the bodies and at the same time legitimize the presence

803
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:10,458
and the intimate relationship with that territory.

804
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:14,041
So the cemeteries are like the Wayúu writings,

805
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:16,791
the documents of a territory,

806
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:18,458
because there are generations

807
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,583
of human occupation that are accumulating,

808
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:24,625
they feed, they form a memory,

809
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:27,750
It is not only a memory in the mind,

810
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:31,000
but it has physical evidence, such as bones

811
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,750
of the ancestors.

812
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:34,375
So that

813
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:37,375
connection, that attraction like

814
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:37,791
is it?

815
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:41,208
How important is it to bury someone Wayúu?

816
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:44,958
There are two types of importance.

817
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:46,333
There are the first burials

818
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:49,375
When a person dies unexpectedly,

819
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:53,041
It could be due to an illness, it could be a war,

820
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:56,541
an epidemic, an accident

821
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:58,333
and the wake is held

822
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:01,333
which is the most important social event of the Wayú.

823
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:06,000
Animals are sacrificed, neighbors, relatives are invited

824
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:10,416
and there they are. After a certain time, about ten, twelve years,

825
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:10,958
eight years,

826
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:14,583
may vary, the family prepares to remove the remains,

827
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,875
accumulates animals, accumulates goods,

828
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,375
start preparing the cemetery,

829
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:23,458
make dwellings, bowers and make a second

830
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:26,458
burial, in that second burial

831
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:30,000
the body is separated from the meat from the bones and the bones

832
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,750
They are kept again in the cemetery, in a special place

833
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:36,791
wrapped with a special wrapper

834
00:41:36,791 --> 00:41:39,875
and a ritual as or more important than the first.

835
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:44,083
That is a renewal of the pact with the territory

836
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:48,291
and at the same time it is the dilution of the individual in something

837
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:51,666
like the ancestors, in something collective

838
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:55,500
which is very important, where your individual traits

839
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,958
They begin to dilute and the collective begins to prevail.

840
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:02,791
and do you have a cemetery?

841
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:04,875
Definitely. It’s name is Manuyalu'u,

842
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:07,875
It is in Carrizal and I have shown it

843
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:13,500
in the books that I was able to show you yesterday.

844
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:16,541
That was from my great-grandmother who is

845
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:19,500
buried there, my grandmother, my great uncles.

846
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:22,208
But, that cemetery

847
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:25,208
It is later than an older cemetery

848
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:28,958
which may be three, four centuries old.

849
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:33,041
It is in Alta Guajira, since they migrated in the 19th century,

850
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:36,125
to that territory,

851
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:39,083
They established a new cemetery.

852
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:41,750
And, they did not lose the relationship

853
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,750
with the family that was in the old cemetery.

854
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:47,958
And when there is conflict, disputes or funerals,

855
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:51,000
connections between

856
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
those territories and those relatives appear.

857
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:57,666
Can you tell me

858
00:42:57,666 --> 00:43:00,666
of rain, the gender and role of rain?

859
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:04,208
The rain,

860
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:07,041
Juyá, it's winter,

861
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:09,458
the heavy rains of October and November,

862
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:12,083
At the same time it is a rainy season,

863
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:15,750
He is a hyper masculine being who

864
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:18,750
has hypostasis, that is,

865
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:23,708
They have other beings that are, for example, iiwa or pamou,

866
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:26,708
or there are several that involve rain.

867
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:30,541
That hyper masculine being is the one that fertilizes the Earth

868
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:35,000
and gives life to the earth so that the earth can

869
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:38,958
give more humans, more trees, more animals.

870
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,541
Fertility itself.

871
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:44,916
In summer the earth falls into a faint,

872
00:43:44,916 --> 00:43:48,583
like a woman, lifeless, falls lifeless, almost lifeless

873
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:53,083
and with rain, with Juyá who fertilizes her, her husband,

874
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:57,291
she revives, is brought to life again and the vital cycle

875
00:43:57,791 --> 00:44:00,791
of all living beings returns.

876
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:04,500
That is why Juyá is a hyper masculine being, mobile like the rain.

877
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,541
The rain that there is also iiwa, another type of minor rain

878
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:10,583
that there can be feminine and masculine,

879
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:14,583
implies a gradualness in the way of falling

880
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,916
and a sequence in the lands that must be watered.

881
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:19,708
The Wayuú

882
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:22,791
They are always governed by the notion of order,

883
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:24,708
that things,

884
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:28,875
phenomena have an order to follow, a protocol

885
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:34,416
and a sequence and gradualness that manages intensity.

886
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:37,708
If it rains very hard on plants

887
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:41,333
small, tiny, this rain is going to destroy them.

888
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:44,333
That is equivalent to rape of a woman.

889
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:47,666
For this reason, rain is always asked to be gradual.

890
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:48,708
and an order,

891
00:44:48,708 --> 00:44:51,833
a sequence of lands that must reach first,

892
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:55,083
others later and others finally.

893
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:21,416
Well, the

894
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:24,875
garden of life, the garden of the jungle, the garden

895
00:45:24,875 --> 00:45:29,291
as a meeting place for humans and non-humans.

896
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:35,875
The world is seen as a crop.

897
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:37,583
The forests

898
00:45:37,583 --> 00:45:38,958
They are a culture of beings

899
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:41,916
like Juya, winter,

900
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:44,166
the wild trees,

901
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:47,166
wild fruits are products

902
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:50,375
of Juya's will to cultivate (the rain)

903
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:54,166
The human garden, where the corn is, the watermelon,

904
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:55,875
the beans, the pumpkin,

905
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:57,500
They are the crops of humans,

906
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:57,916
In this way,

907
00:45:57,916 --> 00:46:01,541
the entire universe corresponds to an order of a cultivation,

908
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:04,916
humans and crops of mythological beings.

909
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:07,500
So therefore there is no separation

910
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,625
because everything has an order.

911
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:12,875
The garden implies a relationship with many

912
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:16,000
beings, it is a stage, the garden is like a theater

913
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:19,708
and the actors are humans,

914
00:46:19,916 --> 00:46:23,833
vegetable seeds, butterflies, worms,

915
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,833
the monkeys, the flies,

916
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:29,833
insects like bees,

917
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:32,583
the birds that eat the crops,

918
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:36,125
the monkeys, the wild pigs.

919
00:46:36,125 --> 00:46:38,625
Everyone intervenes in the garden.

920
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:42,208
So each moment of a being has its appearance

921
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:43,916
like in a drama.

922
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:46,375
So the garden is a polyphonic drama,

923
00:46:46,375 --> 00:46:46,666
And there they

924
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:49,583
coexist in a collaborative, harmonious way,

925
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:50,916
but also antagonistic

926
00:46:50,916 --> 00:46:53,333
humans and other species,

927
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:55,375
It is not a mere vegetable manipulation.

928
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:59,333
That is the garden for the Wayuú.

929
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,625
Well,

930
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:35,708
many in the Western world

931
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:38,791
treat the Earth,

932
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:42,708
natural resources as something that can be extracted,

933
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:45,083
something that can be exploited.

934
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:48,875
What would be a lesson from the Wayuú

935
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:52,083
about that?

936
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:52,708
The Wayuú

937
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:55,791
They have a notion that somehow

938
00:48:56,458 --> 00:48:58,833
the elements found

939
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:01,833
Both on land and in the sea they have owners.

940
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:05,083
Animals have owners, the deer, the rabbit,

941
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:08,000
Hunting animals have an owner.

942
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,875
To access them you must ask for permission.

943
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:12,000
through rituals

944
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,208
to the owners of these animals and not take them in excess.

945
00:49:16,208 --> 00:49:19,958
Those animals are relatives and, in the sea, likewise

946
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,416
It’s not full of natural strangers,

947
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:25,750
It's full of relatives from whom we can take

948
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,666
What we need to feed ourselves,

949
00:49:27,666 --> 00:49:29,208
But by also asking permission from

950
00:49:29,208 --> 00:49:32,208
Pulo'i who is the owner of those animals.

951
00:49:32,458 --> 00:49:35,041
These are relationships of

952
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:37,500
in some way reciprocity.

953
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,416
The Wayuú say, when I'm hungry, says a fisherman,

954
00:49:40,416 --> 00:49:43,041
I go to the sea, I take an animal and I eat it.

955
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:44,916
They are safe at sea.

956
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:48,625
The sea is the meadow, the corral of the animals

957
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,875
and on land there are protective relationships with the sheep,

958
00:49:52,875 --> 00:49:55,208
goats, which are animals

959
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:57,000
that are under the control of humans.

960
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,791
But humans also lose their autonomy

961
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:02,166
when they have animals under their control,

962
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,708
They have to take them to pasture,

963
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:06,583
They have to take him to water, to drink water

964
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:08,166
If they are sick, take care of them,

965
00:50:08,166 --> 00:50:10,541
then both lose their autonomy.

966
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:11,291
Somehow,

967
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:14,291
the sheep also control the shepherds.

968
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:17,000
So it is the Wayúu vision of that, of the world.

969
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,833
The fisherman privileges his freedom

970
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:21,375
to be a free being in the world

971
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:23,916
Like fish that are free, they are not confined.

972
00:50:24,916 --> 00:50:25,875
The Shepherd

973
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:29,083
restricts their autonomy as a human and that of other

974
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:32,625
non-human beings who are under their protection.

975
00:50:32,666 --> 00:50:35,666
So it's the world view of that.

976
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:38,666
But at no point is the natural seen as strange.

977
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:41,958
It is always seen as part of an order

978
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:46,208
in which the human is one of the living forms

979
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:50,250
and eats the animals because it is subsistence,

980
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,916
but you have to ask permission

981
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:54,916
in some way to be able to take advantage.

982
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:56,375
How does one ask for permission?

983
00:50:56,375 --> 00:50:59,375
Permissions are requested through rituals, in some way

984
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:02,958
When the Wayúu use malambo in fishing

985
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:06,375
and prepare infusions and

986
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:09,875
They narrate or make a spell, they tell Pulo'i

987
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:10,750
“here I bring you.

988
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:13,000
Don't say I didn't bring you anything:

989
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,250
Here you have this aromatic resin”, they throw it into the sea

990
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:19,416
or rub it on fishing nets

991
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:21,458
so that she can give them fish.

992
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:24,250
It is a vision that there is a system

993
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:28,791
and they are part of that and they need authorization

994
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:31,791
to take those animals

995
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:33,666
that are their subsistence,

996
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:35,458
but which cannot be abused.

997
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:36,541
How different it would be

998
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:39,375
yes all industrial fishermen

999
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:43,583
before doing that they would ask

1000
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,291
permission.
That's correct.

1001
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:49,291
Even when they are going to take the pottery

1002
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:52,583
From the land to make the vessels, they cannot take it like that,

1003
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:56,416
just because the land is common or abundant.

1004
00:51:56,833 --> 00:52:00,041
The women who make Wayúu ceramics,

1005
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:04,666
They carry coffee, they carry rice or other food.

1006
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:09,125
and first they prepare this in honor of the land, of Mma,

1007
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:13,208
to be able to take that element and turn it into clay,

1008
00:52:13,541 --> 00:52:14,916
turn it into ceramics.

1009
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:19,791
There is always a prior ritual, a request for permission

1010
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:22,791
before proceeding to take an appeal.

1011
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,708
Well, I think that

1012
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:28,666
the last thing I wanted to ask here, because it's something

1013
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:31,708
a little hard to understand, it's Wayúu time

1014
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,291
Yeah.

1015
00:52:34,291 --> 00:52:37,291
Why is it different from Western time?

1016
00:52:37,583 --> 00:52:38,916
That’s correct.

1017
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:41,791
The Wayúu have complex notions of time,

1018
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,958
because time is the horizon

1019
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:46,291
for the understanding of being.

1020
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:47,583
This phrase was said by Martin Heidegger,

1021
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:51,125
but the Wayúu believe it the same

1022
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:55,375
because they understand that first there is a referential time,

1023
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:57,208
What does it mean?

1024
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:58,875
that this time implies a protocol

1025
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:02,125
of the correct way to eat, dress and behave.

1026
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:06,500
That referential time is universal humanity,

1027
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:10,250
the undifferentiation of beings, but which then comes

1028
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,750
a transformative time

1029
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,291
in which the beings changed their appearance.

1030
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:17,458
And these relatives, like plants, their arms

1031
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:20,833
They became branches, their legs into stems and roots.

1032
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:23,500
And all this. And that the animals,

1033
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:27,458
because they were punished for breaking social norms,

1034
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:29,916
for their obsessions

1035
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:32,916
with meat or other types of resources,

1036
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:35,000
or for being shy like deer,

1037
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,666
They were so scary,

1038
00:53:36,666 --> 00:53:39,458
They lived in so much fear that they were converted humans

1039
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:42,375
in deer, or for war like the jaguar.

1040
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:45,666
Then the world had a differentiation

1041
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:46,750
of morphological features.

1042
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,416
This is one

1043
00:53:49,416 --> 00:53:52,416
notion of time, and they have everyday social time,

1044
00:53:52,541 --> 00:53:55,958
the time that is measured in moons, in winter seasons,

1045
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:59,416
in the duration of the sunlight, in the moon,

1046
00:53:59,708 --> 00:54:02,708
They handle the lunar phases a lot.

1047
00:54:02,916 --> 00:54:05,791
The fishermen, the dark time of the moon,

1048
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:08,083
moonlight time marks

1049
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:10,000
fishing activities.

1050
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,125
But there are also social calendars such as wakes,

1051
00:54:14,666 --> 00:54:17,791
certain events, disputes, everything, funerals,

1052
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:20,500
All this marks social time.

1053
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,875
The West has introduced

1054
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:25,166
the notions of Christmas, of the end of the year too

1055
00:54:25,625 --> 00:54:29,041
and states have introduced election time.

1056
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:32,125
The electoral calendars that are somehow

1057
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:35,125
holiday-like processes

1058
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:38,041
and who have competitions for power

1059
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:39,375
in a society that is next

1060
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:41,500
but that influences theirs,

1061
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,166
because they live in a semi-autonomous social field,

1062
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:45,791
then they also have relationships

1063
00:54:45,791 --> 00:54:48,750
with those systems of government power.

1064
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,041
So the Wayúu live in a heterochronic time,

1065
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:56,333
In other words, they have this daily social time next to them,

1066
00:54:57,083 --> 00:54:59,500
they have those times

1067
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,625
referential, those transformative times

1068
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:06,958
that cannot be placed in the past.

1069
00:55:07,166 --> 00:55:10,250
So this heterochromia coexists in the Wayúu world.
