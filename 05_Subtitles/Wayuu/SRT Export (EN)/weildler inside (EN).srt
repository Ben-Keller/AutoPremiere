1
00:00:02:15 --> 00:00:05:15
Good.

2
00:00:05:17 --> 00:00:07:01
Well,

3
00:00:07:01 --> 00:00:10:01
first of all, if you could tell us.

4
00:00:11:09 --> 00:00:12:15
If you could

5
00:00:12:15 --> 00:00:13:19
Introduce yourself?

6
00:00:13:19 --> 00:00:14:13
Yeah.

7
00:00:14:13 --> 00:00:17:22
Well, my name is Weilder Guerra Curbelo,

8
00:00:17:22 --> 00:00:21:06
I am an anthropologist from Universidad de Los Andes.

9
00:00:21:06 --> 00:00:23:18
I am a member of the Wayuú people

10
00:00:23:18 --> 00:00:26:10
and I have dedicated part of my academic life to studying

11
00:00:26:10 --> 00:00:29:10
Their history and their society.

12
00:00:29:14 --> 00:00:30:08
Very good.

13
00:00:30:08 --> 00:00:33:08
And

14
00:00:33:08 --> 00:00:35:04
well, first of all, for someone

15
00:00:35:04 --> 00:00:37:02
who knows nothing about Wayuú people,

16
00:00:37:02 --> 00:00:40:02
who are they and where are they located?

17
00:00:40:13 --> 00:00:41:23
They are indigenous people

18
00:00:41:23 --> 00:00:45:11
located at the north of South America, on the peninsula “La Güajira”

19
00:00:45:11 --> 00:00:48:11
shared by Colombia and Venezuela.

20
00:00:48:21 --> 00:00:51:15
They are the largest town in Colombia

21
00:00:51:15 --> 00:00:54:11
and the largest indigenous people in Venezuela.

22
00:00:54:11 --> 00:00:57:20
Their language is Wayuúnaiki and there’s an estimate of

23
00:00:57:20 --> 00:01:00:23
some 800,000 of these individuals in both countries.

24
00:01:01:22 --> 00:01:04:14
Ok. And

25
00:01:06:11 --> 00:01:07:03
well,

26
00:01:07:03 --> 00:01:10:10
and right now where are we?

27
00:01:10:13 --> 00:01:12:00
We are

28
00:01:12:00 --> 00:01:12:17
In Riohacha,

29
00:01:12:17 --> 00:01:14:14
capital of the department La Güajira,

30
00:01:14:14 --> 00:01:16:23
in the Colombian Republic.

31
00:01:16:23 --> 00:01:18:00
Very good.

32
00:01:18:00 --> 00:01:20:02
And

33
00:01:20:02 --> 00:01:23:02
well, for many years you have been

34
00:01:23:02 --> 00:01:26:02
working with the Wayúu and you are Wayúu as well.

35
00:01:26:12 --> 00:01:29:15
Can you tell me a little about your family and your work?

36
00:01:30:09 --> 00:01:33:21
Well, my family is originally from a pearl fishing

37
00:01:33:21 --> 00:01:35:02
region,

38
00:01:35:02 --> 00:01:38:04
near El Cabo de la Vela, which is called Carrizal

39
00:01:38:21 --> 00:01:41:18
and our territory is called Manuyalu'u

40
00:01:41:18 --> 00:01:45:21
which is a territory inhabited by my ancestors

41
00:01:46:09 --> 00:01:49:09
since the end of the 19th century.

42
00:01:49:19 --> 00:01:52:19
Okay.

43
00:01:54:12 --> 00:01:55:07
And the work

44
00:01:55:07 --> 00:01:59:19
that you have done, more than anything you are a teacher, but also

45
00:02:00:01 --> 00:02:02:21
Have you done other things, other professions?

46
00:02:02:21 --> 00:02:05:21
Yes, I have served as a public official

47
00:02:06:08 --> 00:02:08:01
at least on two occasions,

48
00:02:08:01 --> 00:02:10:12
as Secretary of Indigenous Affairs,

49
00:02:10:12 --> 00:02:13:09
as governor in charge of La Güajira,

50
00:02:13:09 --> 00:02:16:14
as director of the Colombian Caribbean Observatory,

51
00:02:16:14 --> 00:02:19:01
what is a research center

52
00:02:19:01 --> 00:02:22:01
and as manager of the Colombian Central Bank

53
00:02:22:03 --> 00:02:24:05
in the “San Andrés” archipelago

54
00:02:24:05 --> 00:02:25:20
and in the La Güajira department.

55
00:02:27:11 --> 00:02:29:01
And

56
00:02:29:01 --> 00:02:31:15
well, as we have been talking

57
00:02:31:15 --> 00:02:34:23
the other day about the Wayuú’s ontology

58
00:02:35:15 --> 00:02:38:01
and nature

59
00:02:38:01 --> 00:02:41:02
of the earth, what relationship does it have?

60
00:02:41:04 --> 00:02:43:02
I mean, we know it's no different,

61
00:02:43:02 --> 00:02:44:16
but explain that to me.

62
00:02:44:16 --> 00:02:47:13
well, the Wayuú have an ontological conception

63
00:02:47:13 --> 00:02:51:02
in which we must first understand the notion of time,

64
00:02:51:21 --> 00:02:52:20
they have a notion of time

65
00:02:52:20 --> 00:02:55:21
in which the substance of all life was humanity,

66
00:02:56:15 --> 00:02:58:21
the stars were human, the wind,

67
00:02:58:21 --> 00:03:01:21
the current hills, the animals,

68
00:03:02:23 --> 00:03:04:07
the plants.

69
00:03:04:07 --> 00:03:07:14
All these beings were human, there were social institutions

70
00:03:08:01 --> 00:03:10:15
and they communicated throughout human language.

71
00:03:10:15 --> 00:03:14:03
There was already kinship, agriculture, weaving, music,

72
00:03:14:03 --> 00:03:17:21
war, all human institutions and practices.

73
00:03:17:21 --> 00:03:20:17
But the world was undifferentiated,

74
00:03:20:17 --> 00:03:23:17
It had only one form, one substance.

75
00:03:23:18 --> 00:03:26:12
Then comes a transformative

76
00:03:26:12 --> 00:03:30:18
time, several events shape the universe

77
00:03:31:05 --> 00:03:33:23
and all beings begin to change.

78
00:03:33:23 --> 00:03:36:22
Many humans become hills,

79
00:03:36:22 --> 00:03:39:22
others become plants, others become animals.

80
00:03:40:14 --> 00:03:41:15
And in general,

81
00:03:41:15 --> 00:03:45:02
The only non-transformed beings are current humans.

82
00:03:45:20 --> 00:03:48:13
This morphological differentiation

83
00:03:48:13 --> 00:03:51:08
allows us to move into the current world.

84
00:03:51:08 --> 00:03:54:22
However, those beings that today have a different form,

85
00:03:54:22 --> 00:03:57:22
a different taxation,

86
00:03:58:01 --> 00:04:00:16
They retain a residual humanity

87
00:04:00:16 --> 00:04:02:18
and a point of view on the universe,

88
00:04:02:18 --> 00:04:05:09
because they were human in the past,

89
00:04:05:09 --> 00:04:08:12
then they are fallen humans or ex-humans.

90
00:04:09:05 --> 00:04:11:12
So they have a voice

91
00:04:11:12 --> 00:04:14:12
or do they have a story to tell?

92
00:04:14:13 --> 00:04:15:23
They have a story to tell,

93
00:04:15:23 --> 00:04:18:23
but they no longer have human language to communicate.

94
00:04:19:11 --> 00:04:21:15
They have a desire to show themselves in the world,

95
00:04:21:15 --> 00:04:24:11
plants through flowering,

96
00:04:24:11 --> 00:04:27:19
of fruiting, of expanding its leaves,

97
00:04:28:03 --> 00:04:31:05
animals to act as such, to behave.

98
00:04:32:09 --> 00:04:33:06
and to them

99
00:04:33:06 --> 00:04:35:16
we owe them the transmission of knowledge,

100
00:04:35:16 --> 00:04:37:00
to plants and humans

101
00:04:37:00 --> 00:04:40:04
weaving, agriculture, war,

102
00:04:40:15 --> 00:04:43:14
justice, rules.

103
00:04:43:17 --> 00:04:46:19
Everything depends on those mythological beings,

104
00:04:47:06 --> 00:04:50:09
that live in the current world, but in the past

105
00:04:50:19 --> 00:04:53:22
They were and continue to be our cosmic relatives.

106
00:04:54:11 --> 00:04:57:11
So can you talk a bit about that relationship that the Wayúu has

107
00:04:58:08 --> 00:05:01:08
with their own

108
00:05:02:02 --> 00:05:02:22
elements

109
00:05:02:22 --> 00:05:05:01
and characters.

110
00:05:05:01 --> 00:05:07:08
How in referential time

111
00:05:07:08 --> 00:05:10:08
called wayúu Sumaiwa (old) or wayuú Jumaiwa (old),

112
00:05:11:01 --> 00:05:13:15
They were humans, they had clans,

113
00:05:13:15 --> 00:05:16:12
Therefore, today they also have clans.

114
00:05:16:12 --> 00:05:21:05
So the jaguar, the cat, the wild pig,

115
00:05:22:00 --> 00:05:25:00
certain birds, certain bees

116
00:05:25:16 --> 00:05:27:14
They have clans because they had them

117
00:05:27:14 --> 00:05:30:14
in the past, therefore they are still related.

118
00:05:31:04 --> 00:05:34:18
These clans not only refer to that time,

119
00:05:34:18 --> 00:05:36:21
but social attributes

120
00:05:36:21 --> 00:05:40:03
like being numerous, being brave, being cunning,

121
00:05:40:13 --> 00:05:43:22
be meek, be hardworking, be united.

122
00:05:44:06 --> 00:05:46:17
All those social attributes

123
00:05:46:17 --> 00:05:48:16
are shared by humans and animals

124
00:05:48:16 --> 00:05:52:02
and it's a way of somehow organizing the world,

125
00:05:52:14 --> 00:05:55:15
but through a metonymic vision of the world,

126
00:05:56:02 --> 00:05:58:18
which is the sharing of social attributes.

127
00:06:00:09 --> 00:06:02:18
We're going to talk more about that in a bit,

128
00:06:02:18 --> 00:06:03:19
but I also wanted

129
00:06:03:19 --> 00:06:07:23
ask about the history of the people, that is

130
00:06:08:06 --> 00:06:11:12
because I know that they were not colonized, they are the

131
00:06:11:13 --> 00:06:14:18
only non-colonized people or nation.

132
00:06:15:11 --> 00:06:16:22
Yes, Wayuú are people that,

133
00:06:16:22 --> 00:06:19:22
They are a maritime people from the Caribbean

134
00:06:20:03 --> 00:06:23:00
That adopted cattle in the 16th century

135
00:06:23:00 --> 00:06:26:13
They transition to pastoralism,

136
00:06:27:01 --> 00:06:28:05
from being hunters,

137
00:06:28:05 --> 00:06:31:14
fishermen, horticulturists, fruit collectors.

138
00:06:32:00 --> 00:06:35:16
This whole set of groups that today we call Wayuú

139
00:06:36:06 --> 00:06:39:15
They adopted cattle as a way of life

140
00:06:39:15 --> 00:06:42:20
and they took horses, donkeys, cows,

141
00:06:42:20 --> 00:06:46:14
goats and sheep and made a transition to pastoralism.

142
00:06:46:14 --> 00:06:48:17
A large part of the population,

143
00:06:48:17 --> 00:06:51:19
a part of that population on the coast

144
00:06:52:07 --> 00:06:55:18
were dedicated to fishing and therefore also

145
00:06:55:18 --> 00:07:00:06
They appropriated navigation techniques, engines, fishing nets

146
00:07:00:18 --> 00:07:03:07
who were from the Western culture and so too

147
00:07:03:07 --> 00:07:06:13
They strengthened their economic activities on the coast,

148
00:07:06:23 --> 00:07:10:12
but they also crossed empires, they went to Jamaica,

149
00:07:10:22 --> 00:07:13:00
They went to the French keys,

150
00:07:13:00 --> 00:07:16:00
Traveled to the Dutch possessions of Aruba,

151
00:07:16:06 --> 00:07:18:05
Curaçao, Bonaire,

152
00:07:18:05 --> 00:07:21:04
throughout the Dutch Caribbean and other Caribbean ports.

153
00:07:21:12 --> 00:07:23:05
This allowed them

154
00:07:23:05 --> 00:07:26:18
cross several empires and have an open mind,

155
00:07:27:02 --> 00:07:31:09
conceive maps of the world, a very extensive geography,

156
00:07:31:09 --> 00:07:32:17
very wide,

157
00:07:32:17 --> 00:07:36:01
and see the world beyond the jurisdiction of

158
00:07:36:01 --> 00:07:37:07
the Spanish monarchy.

159
00:07:38:07 --> 00:07:41:07
That is why they are trans-imperial historical subjects.

160
00:07:41:15 --> 00:07:44:03
When they arrive to the Colombian Republic

161
00:07:44:03 --> 00:07:46:14
These ties were cut

162
00:07:46:14 --> 00:07:47:03
and the wayuú

163
00:07:47:03 --> 00:07:50:20
were trapped in their peninsula, circumscribed

164
00:07:51:05 --> 00:07:54:05
to the jurisdiction of the Republic of Colombia.

165
00:07:56:02 --> 00:07:56:19
Interesting.

166
00:07:56:19 --> 00:07:59:20
And before that, I think I had also read that never

167
00:07:59:20 --> 00:08:02:22
were conquered or colonized.
The Wayuú were not

168
00:08:02:22 --> 00:08:03:22
subjugated,

169
00:08:03:22 --> 00:08:06:23
They always rebelled against any form

170
00:08:06:23 --> 00:08:10:00
Of limitation to their political autonomy.

171
00:08:10:12 --> 00:08:14:09
To give an example, in 1769

172
00:08:15:11 --> 00:08:18:11
They revolted against the Spanish crown on May 2

173
00:08:18:19 --> 00:08:21:19
and in a war that lasted more than four years,

174
00:08:21:20 --> 00:08:23:10
They burned many Spaniards villages,

175
00:08:23:10 --> 00:08:27:12
defeated the Spanish military forces,

176
00:08:27:23 --> 00:08:30:23
They killed missionaries, they destroyed churches

177
00:08:31:07 --> 00:08:34:16
and that is known as the May 69 uprising.

178
00:08:35:07 --> 00:08:37:16
In 1752

179
00:08:37:16 --> 00:08:38:09
they had done

180
00:08:38:09 --> 00:08:39:09
formal agreements

181
00:08:39:09 --> 00:08:40:19
with the Republic of Holland

182
00:08:40:19 --> 00:08:42:20
to protect Dutch trade

183
00:08:42:20 --> 00:08:45:23
In the güajiro ports, they were historical subjects

184
00:08:46:14 --> 00:08:49:14
collectives, capable of protecting their territory.

185
00:08:49:21 --> 00:08:52:21
So, this people have been a people that has

186
00:08:53:01 --> 00:08:55:06
resisted those forms of external domination

187
00:08:57:12 --> 00:09:01:07
Today it has two republics that control its territory

188
00:09:01:07 --> 00:09:04:10
and they divided it, which are Venezuela and Colombia.

189
00:09:07:08 --> 00:09:10:04
And

190
00:09:10:04 --> 00:09:13:04
following that, that is, as

191
00:09:15:05 --> 00:09:16:13
nan

192
00:09:16:13 --> 00:09:20:05
well, can you tell me a little about your justice system?

193
00:09:20:08 --> 00:09:23:00
with the palabrero.

194
00:09:23:00 --> 00:09:25:01
The Wayúu have a justice system

195
00:09:25:01 --> 00:09:27:01
based on rhetoric

196
00:09:27:01 --> 00:09:30:01
and in persuasion and compensation.

197
00:09:30:15 --> 00:09:34:17
Any physical offense, any aggression or any moral affront

198
00:09:35:03 --> 00:09:37:19
that one person causes another, voluntary

199
00:09:37:19 --> 00:09:40:19
or involuntarily, must be compensated.

200
00:09:41:01 --> 00:09:43:22
This compensation is not requested directly,

201
00:09:43:22 --> 00:09:46:22
but through specialists, called Pütchipü

202
00:09:47:03 --> 00:09:49:21
or palabrero, and the compensation

203
00:09:49:21 --> 00:09:51:08
is not delivered to the victim,

204
00:09:51:08 --> 00:09:53:15
but to the relatives of the victim.

205
00:09:53:15 --> 00:09:56:13
This norm is called sukuaipa wayuu, which means

206
00:09:56:13 --> 00:09:59:13
the güajiro way of doing things,

207
00:09:59:14 --> 00:10:02:13
and these elements that are given are cattle,

208
00:10:02:13 --> 00:10:05:13
necklaces, animals, and weapons.

209
00:10:05:15 --> 00:10:06:23
Lately money,

210
00:10:06:23 --> 00:10:09:01
but money was not in the tradition

211
00:10:09:01 --> 00:10:12:05
Where money is involved, it goes like cattle or like a necklace.

212
00:10:13:01 --> 00:10:16:01
Did they use barter a lot?

213
00:10:16:01 --> 00:10:17:15
They exchanged things

214
00:10:17:15 --> 00:10:21:07
but also the money, because the Wayúu first

215
00:10:21:19 --> 00:10:24:22
They exported pearls, they exchanged pearls for weapons,

216
00:10:24:22 --> 00:10:27:22
for food, for fabric, for metal objects,

217
00:10:28:03 --> 00:10:29:12
Brazilwood,

218
00:10:29:12 --> 00:10:33:08
cowhide, cattle with the English, a lot of cattle

219
00:10:34:10 --> 00:10:37:02
divi-divi, and other elements,

220
00:10:37:02 --> 00:10:40:04
all this until the 19th and early 20th centuries.

221
00:10:41:07 --> 00:10:44:07
And you told me that your family

222
00:10:44:10 --> 00:10:47:04
did they start with that pearl collecting?

223
00:10:47:04 --> 00:10:49:03
Is that still going on?
No.

224
00:10:49:03 --> 00:10:52:04
Pearls were very important in life in La Güajira

225
00:10:52:14 --> 00:10:56:21
in the 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries,

226
00:10:57:06 --> 00:11:00:11
but the Japanese introduced pearl farming,

227
00:11:00:19 --> 00:11:03:19
with which the pearl dived,

228
00:11:04:13 --> 00:11:07:05
which was already more difficult to obtain, which required

229
00:11:07:05 --> 00:11:10:05
a lot of human effort and not the cultivated one,

230
00:11:10:18 --> 00:11:13:13
fell somehow as an activity

231
00:11:13:13 --> 00:11:17:18
and therefore today the Wayuú do not fish for pearls,

232
00:11:17:18 --> 00:11:20:09
although the pearl banks are

233
00:11:20:09 --> 00:11:23:01
full in La Güajira’s sea.

234
00:11:23:01 --> 00:11:23:20
Interesting,

235
00:11:23:20 --> 00:11:26:20
didn't know that.

236
00:11:27:09 --> 00:11:30:09
Well,

237
00:11:30:18 --> 00:11:31:18
can you talk to me

238
00:11:31:18 --> 00:11:35:15
a bit about dreams and the importance they have

239
00:11:35:15 --> 00:11:36:20
dreams in the Wayúu culture?

240
00:11:37:22 --> 00:11:40:22
Dreams are prescriptive in the Wayúu world.

241
00:11:41:05 --> 00:11:43:06
It's called Lapü,

242
00:11:43:06 --> 00:11:47:12
Lapü is a character, he generates the dream

243
00:11:47:12 --> 00:11:51:09
Himself. He’s so powerful that when cultural heroes,

244
00:11:51:09 --> 00:11:52:17
Wayúu semi-divine figures

245
00:11:52:17 --> 00:11:56:00
like Maleiwa dream, they have to obey the dream.

246
00:11:56:15 --> 00:12:00:13
So dreams are instructions for every living being.

247
00:12:00:13 --> 00:12:01:23
It is not discussed.

248
00:12:01:23 --> 00:12:05:01
The dream can order the sacrifice of animals,

249
00:12:05:17 --> 00:12:07:15
sleep can order confinement

250
00:12:07:15 --> 00:12:10:06
of some people, rituals,

251
00:12:10:06 --> 00:12:12:20
different decisions and you have to obey them.

252
00:12:12:20 --> 00:12:15:14
Dream governs much of Wayúu life,

253
00:12:15:14 --> 00:12:17:21
the dreamlike is fundamental.

254
00:12:17:21 --> 00:12:20:19
One wayúu can ask the other

255
00:12:20:19 --> 00:12:21:12
the next day

256
00:12:21:12 --> 00:12:24:12
When they wake up, “what did you dream of?” instead of “good morning!”

257
00:12:25:14 --> 00:12:27:06
Nice.

258
00:12:27:06 --> 00:12:31:15
And that brings me a bit to the idea of a world

259
00:12:32:07 --> 00:12:35:07
Nazu versus the Ulazu

260
00:12:35:19 --> 00:12:38:19
how the visible and non-visible world.

261
00:12:38:23 --> 00:12:40:16
Yes, it's because the dream

262
00:12:40:16 --> 00:12:43:16
It is a bridge that allows us to communicate,

263
00:12:44:03 --> 00:12:47:19
for example, with corn, with beans, with pumpkin,

264
00:12:47:21 --> 00:12:49:09
with these ex humans

265
00:12:49:09 --> 00:12:52:08
and see them in the dream with their original appearance,

266
00:12:52:17 --> 00:12:54:11
not like today's vegetables,

267
00:12:54:11 --> 00:12:57:04
but like the humans they were in the past.

268
00:12:57:04 --> 00:12:58:15
The dream is revealing,

269
00:12:58:15 --> 00:12:59:15
can announce you

270
00:12:59:15 --> 00:13:04:10
happy or tragic events in the life of a family group.

271
00:13:06:01 --> 00:13:08:18
Interesting.

272
00:13:08:18 --> 00:13:10:09
Well,

273
00:13:10:09 --> 00:13:13:09
can you explain me about.

274
00:13:13:09 --> 00:13:15:10
Well, two things. One,

275
00:13:15:10 --> 00:13:18:10
What has recently happened with the

276
00:13:20:00 --> 00:13:20:23
hydrogen generators? and also

277
00:13:20:23 --> 00:13:23:11
with that topic

278
00:13:23:11 --> 00:13:25:10
linked is obviously the wind,

279
00:13:25:10 --> 00:13:28:14
What is this ontological conflict that is happening there?

280
00:13:28:23 --> 00:13:30:06
La Güajira

281
00:13:30:06 --> 00:13:32:17
is a region located in the north of Colombia that has

282
00:13:32:17 --> 00:13:35:17
many natural resources, coal.

283
00:13:35:19 --> 00:13:38:19
That's why there are very powerful mining companies here,

284
00:13:38:21 --> 00:13:39:22
gas, that's why

285
00:13:39:22 --> 00:13:43:09
Texaco, Chevron, all these companies have been here.

286
00:13:44:01 --> 00:13:46:17
It also has

287
00:13:46:17 --> 00:13:49:16
salt in abundance and that’s why it has been the first producer of

288
00:13:49:16 --> 00:13:50:17
Salt of the country.

289
00:13:50:17 --> 00:13:54:16
And now, a renewable energy bonanza is coming

290
00:13:55:04 --> 00:13:57:16
based on solar luminosity,

291
00:13:57:16 --> 00:14:00:00
but mainly in the wind.

292
00:14:00:00 --> 00:14:00:19
These companies

293
00:14:00:19 --> 00:14:02:02
They are arriving in Colombia

294
00:14:02:02 --> 00:14:04:08
or to La Güajira along with the Government

295
00:14:04:08 --> 00:14:07:00
to make an Energy transition,

296
00:14:07:00 --> 00:14:10:21
But practices can continue to be extractive.

297
00:14:11:11 --> 00:14:11:19
I mean,

298
00:14:11:19 --> 00:14:13:15
They are called “clean energies”,

299
00:14:13:15 --> 00:14:15:17
but in the relationship with the communities

300
00:14:15:17 --> 00:14:18:10
They can rely on behaviors that are the same

301
00:14:18:10 --> 00:14:20:16
to those of the old companies.

302
00:14:20:16 --> 00:14:24:14
So, at this moment there are ontological conflicts

303
00:14:25:01 --> 00:14:28:14
between the Wayúu people and those companies,

304
00:14:29:01 --> 00:14:32:14
Because they don't understand how the Wayúu see the world,

305
00:14:32:23 --> 00:14:36:08
how the Wayúu see the winds: They see them as plural beings,

306
00:14:36:16 --> 00:14:39:20
ambiguous, which can be masculine or feminine,

307
00:14:40:04 --> 00:14:43:11
that have no fixed place, but paths through which they cross,

308
00:14:43:19 --> 00:14:45:21
that are related to well-being,

309
00:14:45:21 --> 00:14:48:03
with certain elements of life

310
00:14:48:03 --> 00:14:51:17
and therefore the vision is not understood

311
00:14:52:02 --> 00:14:55:11
who sees the wind as a business, as an air mass

312
00:14:55:11 --> 00:14:58:18
hot, like inanimate geophysical agents,

313
00:14:59:01 --> 00:15:00:15
of this Wayuú’s vision

314
00:15:00:15 --> 00:15:04:00
who see them as beings with the capacity for agency,

315
00:15:04:10 --> 00:15:07:10
with reflexivity and with a moral code.

316
00:15:07:13 --> 00:15:09:09
And that's why there was a conflict?

317
00:15:09:09 --> 00:15:12:09
And what happened to the recent companies?

318
00:15:12:15 --> 00:15:15:15
What has happened lately is that some companies

319
00:15:15:18 --> 00:15:18:03
who do not know the social organization,

320
00:15:18:03 --> 00:15:20:08
Wayúu territorial rights,

321
00:15:20:08 --> 00:15:21:16
They reached some areas,

322
00:15:21:16 --> 00:15:24:11
they made some quick questions

323
00:15:24:11 --> 00:15:27:14
and then the projects began to be built,

324
00:15:27:14 --> 00:15:31:08
but the underlying conflicts that were there and the

325
00:15:31:08 --> 00:15:32:10
Lack of understanding

326
00:15:32:10 --> 00:15:36:08
with the Wayúu social environment, has led to blockades,

327
00:15:36:08 --> 00:15:39:18
The differences between the Wayúu population and companies.

328
00:15:40:01 --> 00:15:40:21
And one of them,

329
00:15:40:21 --> 00:15:43:21
in Green Power, decided to abandon his project.

330
00:15:44:02 --> 00:15:44:19
Right now,

331
00:15:44:19 --> 00:15:45:22
the president of La Güajira

332
00:15:45:22 --> 00:15:47:03
is here

333
00:15:47:03 --> 00:15:49:09
to rebuild those relationships

334
00:15:49:09 --> 00:15:51:09
and try to generate an agreement

335
00:15:51:09 --> 00:15:53:02
among indigenous peoples

336
00:15:53:02 --> 00:15:55:14
and those renewable energy projects.

337
00:15:57:00 --> 00:16:00:00
And for you, what steps need to be taken?

338
00:16:01:04 --> 00:16:04:04
to reach an agreement like this between the people and the government?

339
00:16:05:11 --> 00:16:08:15
A set of rules, the first thing the government

340
00:16:08:15 --> 00:16:11:19
Has to do is to establish a set of rules that enforce

341
00:16:11:19 --> 00:16:14:19
Indigenous and communities rights.

342
00:16:15:03 --> 00:16:17:16
So companies do not see the Wayúu territory

343
00:16:17:16 --> 00:16:20:23
like a national wasteland, like a land without an owner, it is a

344
00:16:20:23 --> 00:16:23:23
constitutionally protected reservation.

345
00:16:24:01 --> 00:16:28:00
It has 1,070,000 hectares, therefore large.

346
00:16:28:08 --> 00:16:29:02
But the Wayuú

347
00:16:29:02 --> 00:16:32:02
They have notions of territory that must be respected,

348
00:16:32:03 --> 00:16:35:10
They have notions of social organization, of family

349
00:16:35:19 --> 00:16:38:22
and notions of rights and territorial control

350
00:16:39:08 --> 00:16:43:04
and ontological that these companies must know

351
00:16:43:04 --> 00:16:46:18
and understand. When they talk to the Wayuú, when they understand

352
00:16:47:08 --> 00:16:50:15
how this society thinks and what its norms are like,

353
00:16:51:02 --> 00:16:54:12
then there could be an understandable dialogue between the two.

354
00:16:54:12 --> 00:16:56:15
One has a commercial logic,

355
00:16:56:15 --> 00:16:59:08
the others have their own ontological mission.

356
00:16:59:08 --> 00:17:00:16
Bringing that closer is key.

357
00:17:00:16 --> 00:17:03:20
Now, the indigenous people are economic subjects, that is,

358
00:17:03:20 --> 00:17:06:21
They have valid, legitimate expectations and interests.

359
00:17:07:17 --> 00:17:10:17
Therefore, companies see it as Rousseau beings,

360
00:17:10:22 --> 00:17:13:17
like the noble savage who does not aspire for money

361
00:17:13:17 --> 00:17:14:21
nor can he aspire to money

362
00:17:14:21 --> 00:17:17:21
because it contaminates his condition as a noble savage.

363
00:17:18:14 --> 00:17:21:06
It is different from the Wayúu, who crossed Empires

364
00:17:21:06 --> 00:17:26:05
to carry contraband, merchandise, to Holland, to Jamaica.

365
00:17:26:15 --> 00:17:30:09
So that’s ignoring their history as an maritime indigenous people

366
00:17:32:18 --> 00:17:34:00
Yes, of course.

367
00:17:34:00 --> 00:17:38:01
And that's talking about the norms of the Wayúu people,

368
00:17:38:17 --> 00:17:42:22
Maybe a very important one is the matrilineal.

369
00:17:44:01 --> 00:17:44:16
Definitely.

370
00:17:44:16 --> 00:17:46:01
What they must understand

371
00:17:46:01 --> 00:17:48:08
is that in the Wayúu territoriality

372
00:17:48:08 --> 00:17:50:15
lands are inherited from the uterine side,

373
00:17:50:15 --> 00:17:52:04
on the maternal side,

374
00:17:52:04 --> 00:17:55:02
for what the Wayúu call Wapushi, our family,

375
00:17:55:02 --> 00:17:58:05
and therefore sometimes they can be left to children

376
00:17:58:13 --> 00:18:01:08
living in the territory without having the right

377
00:18:01:08 --> 00:18:05:08
to decide. These companies

378
00:18:05:08 --> 00:18:06:13
they reach the territories

379
00:18:06:13 --> 00:18:09:13
and talk to the first person they find,

380
00:18:09:16 --> 00:18:11:07
thinking that because they live there

381
00:18:11:07 --> 00:18:13:03
They are the owners of the territory.

382
00:18:13:03 --> 00:18:16:03
It turns out that it is not like that and it is not usually like that.

383
00:18:16:09 --> 00:18:18:17
Someone can live far away without having

384
00:18:18:17 --> 00:18:20:06
that presence

385
00:18:20:06 --> 00:18:23:06
in the occupation of the land and that belonging.

386
00:18:23:10 --> 00:18:26:07
There have been many disagreements in two

387
00:18:26:07 --> 00:18:29:19
logics of seeing the world, two ways of seeing the universe.

388
00:18:31:00 --> 00:18:31:05
Sure

389
00:18:31:05 --> 00:18:34:05
and that is I think the axis of everything.

390
00:18:34:09 --> 00:18:35:13
Definitely.

391
00:18:35:13 --> 00:18:38:02
And for someone who doesn't know

392
00:18:38:02 --> 00:18:41:02
what is an ontology and what is ontology,

393
00:18:41:02 --> 00:18:44:08
so as a summary

394
00:18:44:08 --> 00:18:48:02
of the Wayúu people or summarized.
Correct.

395
00:18:48:09 --> 00:18:49:21
Well, ontology is the science of

396
00:18:49:21 --> 00:18:51:15
The being in all human lives

397
00:18:51:15 --> 00:18:54:12
and it is a field of philosophy and metaphysics.

398
00:18:54:12 --> 00:18:56:15
But,

399
00:18:56:15 --> 00:18:59:04
Well, anthropology has been very interested

400
00:18:59:04 --> 00:19:00:02
for the ways

401
00:19:00:02 --> 00:19:01:11
in which human societies

402
00:19:01:11 --> 00:19:04:05
give signficance to the universe.

403
00:19:04:05 --> 00:19:07:05
How they classify the stars, the winds,

404
00:19:07:07 --> 00:19:11:01
vegetation, animals, other non-human beings.

405
00:19:11:09 --> 00:19:15:00
And find knowledge and ways

406
00:19:15:00 --> 00:19:18:07
of conceiving time and beings very sophisticated.

407
00:19:18:20 --> 00:19:22:06
Not only taxonomy, categorization principles,

408
00:19:23:10 --> 00:19:25:20
ways of relating to non-humans,

409
00:19:25:20 --> 00:19:30:00
modes of classification and categorization.

410
00:19:30:09 --> 00:19:31:02
So the Wayuú

411
00:19:31:02 --> 00:19:35:09
They are a people who first of all consider

412
00:19:35:09 --> 00:19:39:05
that many non-humans were humans in the past.

413
00:19:39:05 --> 00:19:39:23
Therefore,

414
00:19:39:23 --> 00:19:41:19
They have a residual humanity

415
00:19:41:19 --> 00:19:44:11
that inhabits them and are relatives.

416
00:19:44:11 --> 00:19:46:10
They are not inanimate beings.

417
00:19:46:10 --> 00:19:49:14
A fishing company can see many fish

418
00:19:49:14 --> 00:19:53:05
per metric tons of production, a stock.

419
00:19:53:21 --> 00:19:56:05
The Wayuú see them as relatives,

420
00:19:56:05 --> 00:19:58:19
They don't see it from instrumental mathematics,

421
00:19:58:19 --> 00:20:01:13
but sees them from kinship.

422
00:20:01:13 --> 00:20:03:03
It’s another type of.

423
00:20:03:03 --> 00:20:05:01
Well, science as we know in the West

424
00:20:06:04 --> 00:20:07:04
is a type of

425
00:20:07:04 --> 00:20:10:04
science, a type of knowing a world.

426
00:20:10:17 --> 00:20:13:22
Well, the Wayúu has that, as they say, like complex

427
00:20:14:04 --> 00:20:19:14
and full of important, small, big things.

428
00:20:20:02 --> 00:20:23:00
Exact. The deep difference

429
00:20:23:00 --> 00:20:25:04
the ontological separation

430
00:20:25:04 --> 00:20:28:04
among humanity

431
00:20:28:14 --> 00:20:32:02
and non-humans is very deep in the West.

432
00:20:32:14 --> 00:20:33:21
In these type of communities

433
00:20:33:21 --> 00:20:36:21
as the wayúu is not so deep and they can be

434
00:20:36:21 --> 00:20:39:23
closer to some non-humans than to some humans,

435
00:20:40:07 --> 00:20:43:07
because these non-humans are their relatives

436
00:20:43:07 --> 00:20:46:12
and they were humans in the past and have social attributes

437
00:20:46:20 --> 00:20:48:03
that are shared.

438
00:20:48:03 --> 00:20:52:11
The Wayuú do not see other beings as natural strangers,

439
00:20:52:22 --> 00:20:56:15
but as relatives who in the past were

440
00:20:57:01 --> 00:21:00:01
and the world more than in its creation,

441
00:21:00:13 --> 00:21:03:21
They see it as a modeling and a transformation.

442
00:21:04:10 --> 00:21:05:15
Focus on transformative events

443
00:21:06:20 --> 00:21:09:11
and they believe that the world is subject to modeling,

444
00:21:09:11 --> 00:21:11:08
because Mma, the Earth,

445
00:21:11:08 --> 00:21:14:15
which is the mother of all living beings, is mysterious,

446
00:21:15:05 --> 00:21:17:01
and therefore has the capacity

447
00:21:17:01 --> 00:21:20:01
to transform the beings that inhabit it.

448
00:21:20:04 --> 00:21:23:11
Tell me a little about that, about the transformation, the Mma

449
00:21:23:23 --> 00:21:27:11
and how he was telling me that she is mysterious, but also

450
00:21:28:04 --> 00:21:32:23
is not 100% righteous, because she is also a human.

451
00:21:33:15 --> 00:21:37:21
Yes, Mma (Earth), as in principle she is seen as human in that

452
00:21:38:20 --> 00:21:39:17
referential time,

453
00:21:39:17 --> 00:21:41:22
that referential order of things

454
00:21:41:22 --> 00:21:44:02
She is the sister of Palaa, the Sea.

455
00:21:44:02 --> 00:21:46:18
Then Mma every so often

456
00:21:46:18 --> 00:21:49:18
It has conflicts with the Sea, and the Sea invades it

457
00:21:50:00 --> 00:21:50:23
and then the Earth

458
00:21:50:23 --> 00:21:52:03
and the beings of the Earth

459
00:21:52:03 --> 00:21:56:07
They have to use torches and fire to make her come back

460
00:21:56:17 --> 00:21:59:18
to its limits and its initial shores.

461
00:22:00:02 --> 00:22:02:22
But in that flooding process

462
00:22:02:22 --> 00:22:05:00
there is a transformation of beings.

463
00:22:05:00 --> 00:22:08:09
So life is in a continuous transformation

464
00:22:08:18 --> 00:22:12:00
And those transformative events are very important

465
00:22:12:09 --> 00:22:14:13
for peoples like the Wayúu,

466
00:22:14:13 --> 00:22:17:13
who are very aware of that.

467
00:22:17:13 --> 00:22:19:07
What matters for the Wayúu is not

468
00:22:19:07 --> 00:22:22:18
when an event occurred, but rather that the event occurred.

469
00:22:23:08 --> 00:22:26:11
Out of those events, there are transformations in the landscape

470
00:22:26:20 --> 00:22:30:09
a rock, some drawings, a mirage,

471
00:22:30:14 --> 00:22:34:15
a hill or hills that have distinctive features.

472
00:22:34:23 --> 00:22:38:04
That is why for the Wayúu the territory is an open book,

473
00:22:38:10 --> 00:22:41:10
because it is the stage where the events occur,

474
00:22:41:14 --> 00:22:43:14
the events that shape beings.

475
00:22:44:21 --> 00:22:47:04
Can you tell me about two things, one

476
00:22:47:04 --> 00:22:50:21
a bit more about how land or a territory

477
00:22:50:21 --> 00:22:52:01
it’s a book?

478
00:22:52:01 --> 00:22:55:23
And related to that, what subjects,

479
00:22:55:23 --> 00:22:57:12
which ones

480
00:22:57:12 --> 00:23:00:12
chapters we find in that,

481
00:23:00:17 --> 00:23:02:04
That book?

482
00:23:02:04 --> 00:23:05:04
Many hills, the hills that make up La Güajira,

483
00:23:05:23 --> 00:23:08:10
They were humans who traveled,

484
00:23:08:10 --> 00:23:10:07
They traveled through the güajiro territory,

485
00:23:10:07 --> 00:23:13:07
some stayed in it and became a hill

486
00:23:13:07 --> 00:23:14:15
Due to thirst,

487
00:23:14:15 --> 00:23:18:02
because they got lost, because they found love,

488
00:23:18:15 --> 00:23:20:06
as in the case of Kamaishi,

489
00:23:20:06 --> 00:23:23:02
The case of Episcua, Sosopo, Iitüjo´i.

490
00:23:23:02 --> 00:23:26:02
The monks as well, Walirajau,

491
00:23:26:02 --> 00:23:28:18
that are in the sea, in the gulf with Venezuela,

492
00:23:28:18 --> 00:23:30:21
all the hills have a story,

493
00:23:30:21 --> 00:23:33:04
Pa´ntui in Cabo de la Vela

494
00:23:33:04 --> 00:23:36:04
and that history shapes the territory,

495
00:23:36:08 --> 00:23:37:17
shaping the landscape

496
00:23:37:17 --> 00:23:40:17
As they were frozen footprints of the ancestors.

497
00:23:40:20 --> 00:23:44:06
Therefore, seeing a landscape, seeing a hill, seeing a rock,

498
00:23:44:19 --> 00:23:46:01
is to evoke stories,

499
00:23:46:01 --> 00:23:49:18
stories interconnected with other places that form

500
00:23:49:18 --> 00:23:53:12
that intelligible text of life that is the landscape.

501
00:23:53:16 --> 00:23:56:21
Those movements, those traces of the ancestors.

502
00:23:57:06 --> 00:23:58:23
So, that's why the territory

503
00:23:58:23 --> 00:24:01:10
It is so important for the Wayuú.

504
00:24:01:10 --> 00:24:04:07
Each of these places has a tale.

505
00:24:04:07 --> 00:24:06:03
How it was transformed

506
00:24:06:03 --> 00:24:09:03
why this hill came and found a female wind

507
00:24:09:10 --> 00:24:12:16
and fell in love with her and his cattle went to the sea like Kamaishi

508
00:24:13:14 --> 00:24:17:11
and therefore, it regulates the things of the sea.

509
00:24:17:11 --> 00:24:18:10
As another regulated

510
00:24:18:10 --> 00:24:21:17
agriculture, as another was a shepherd in the past.

511
00:24:22:10 --> 00:24:25:10
All these things explain how the world works.

512
00:24:25:17 --> 00:24:28:02
and they give meaning to the universe.

513
00:24:28:02 --> 00:24:28:12
Can you explain to me or

514
00:24:29:15 --> 00:24:31:15
tell how the most important

515
00:24:31:15 --> 00:24:34:15
hills and shapes

516
00:24:35:12 --> 00:24:38:01
non-human or ex-human

517
00:24:38:01 --> 00:24:39:19
of the territory

518
00:24:39:19 --> 00:24:42:19
and maybe a bit about their...

519
00:24:42:23 --> 00:24:45:23
character or how they were like?

520
00:24:46:12 --> 00:24:49:13
Yes, I can tell the story of Kamaishi

521
00:24:49:18 --> 00:24:53:21
or Epitsu, they are two sister hills, they are three hills.

522
00:24:53:21 --> 00:24:56:21
The older brother was in Macuira, Iitüjo'i.

523
00:24:56:21 --> 00:24:57:15
Once upon a time,

524
00:24:57:15 --> 00:25:00:15
With a very intense summer, he told his brothers

525
00:25:00:22 --> 00:25:02:00
that the land

526
00:25:02:00 --> 00:25:05:00
was not enough for the herd of the three

527
00:25:05:01 --> 00:25:08:01
Then they both left

528
00:25:08:06 --> 00:25:11:19
towards the base of the peninsula to search for land

529
00:25:12:05 --> 00:25:13:09
and then one of them

530
00:25:13:09 --> 00:25:16:09
He reached Cabo de la Vela, near Cabo de la Vela.

531
00:25:16:17 --> 00:25:17:18
Over there,

532
00:25:17:18 --> 00:25:20:20
While he was with his animals, a woman named Jepiraichi passed by.

533
00:25:21:08 --> 00:25:23:16
This woman asked him what he came for.

534
00:25:23:16 --> 00:25:26:16
He told him, I've come to seek land for my herd.

535
00:25:27:06 --> 00:25:28:06
She left

536
00:25:28:06 --> 00:25:31:06
and returned in the evening and brought him fish to eat,

537
00:25:31:14 --> 00:25:34:14
delicious fish to eat, snapper, grouper.

538
00:25:34:21 --> 00:25:38:00
And then he asked her if she lived there.

539
00:25:38:00 --> 00:25:40:15
She told him that she didn’t live here, but she would passed by.

540
00:25:40:15 --> 00:25:42:17
The winds do not live in one place,

541
00:25:42:17 --> 00:25:45:17
the winds pass through the places, they fell in love

542
00:25:46:01 --> 00:25:49:01
and all Kamaishi's herd ended up in the Sea

543
00:25:49:06 --> 00:25:52:03
and they are many of the fish we have today.

544
00:25:52:03 --> 00:25:56:06
The other brother went to where his place is today,

545
00:25:57:04 --> 00:25:59:23
He met a wind woman called Arüleshi

546
00:25:59:23 --> 00:26:01:16
and she asked him what he was doing.

547
00:26:01:16 --> 00:26:03:08
He told her what he was doing

548
00:26:03:08 --> 00:26:06:08
and she returned in the evening with corn,

549
00:26:06:13 --> 00:26:09:14
beans, pumpkin, cassava, food.

550
00:26:09:23 --> 00:26:14:01
And then the two fell in love and this man became

551
00:26:14:10 --> 00:26:17:11
Who, in some way, influences

552
00:26:18:05 --> 00:26:21:04
the food on Earth.

553
00:26:21:13 --> 00:26:23:17
So there it stayed and became a hill

554
00:26:23:17 --> 00:26:24:15
and it is the hill that

555
00:26:24:15 --> 00:26:28:13
we know today. That triad of brother hills,

556
00:26:28:14 --> 00:26:31:14
They are a territorial arrangement,

557
00:26:31:20 --> 00:26:33:11
of economic activities

558
00:26:33:11 --> 00:26:36:11
of the territory written from a referential time.

559
00:26:37:10 --> 00:26:39:08
Interesting.

560
00:26:39:08 --> 00:26:39:18
Well, I

561
00:26:39:18 --> 00:26:41:10
I think at one point,

562
00:26:41:10 --> 00:26:45:18
we want you to maybe give us a little tour of

563
00:26:46:22 --> 00:26:49:22
your books and also the room and

564
00:26:50:10 --> 00:26:53:10
the painting there and can you tell me

565
00:26:53:10 --> 00:26:56:18
which room or house are we in now?

566
00:26:57:06 --> 00:26:59:12
Of course. Well, it’s my house.

567
00:26:59:12 --> 00:27:02:11
This is my house that I am just building,

568
00:27:02:11 --> 00:27:05:11
It's not finished,

569
00:27:05:18 --> 00:27:07:11
but hey, I'm building it just the way I like it

570
00:27:07:11 --> 00:27:11:02
like a enrramada Wayúu open to the winds.

571
00:27:11:11 --> 00:27:12:08
Yes.

572
00:27:12:08 --> 00:27:14:06
Tell me a little about that architecture.

573
00:27:14:06 --> 00:27:17:02
Is it anything like the original?

574
00:27:17:02 --> 00:27:20:02
Yes, it is very original and it is open.

575
00:28:19:02 --> 00:28:19:22
This is a girl in the

576
00:28:19:22 --> 00:28:21:15
confinement, to the Wayúu girls,

577
00:28:21:15 --> 00:28:24:17
When they experience their first menstruation they lock them up

578
00:28:25:01 --> 00:28:28:18
and she spends months there, learning how to knit,

579
00:28:29:02 --> 00:28:32:13
who is her family, learning how to think, her grandmother, her mother, her aunts,

580
00:28:32:20 --> 00:28:33:18
They are going to teach it.

581
00:28:33:18 --> 00:28:36:19
And that's what she's doing there. She’s in limbo

582
00:28:37:06 --> 00:28:40:16
She is neither a girl nor a woman, she is like a chrysalis.

583
00:28:40:23 --> 00:28:43:02
When she comes out, she comes out as a woman.

584
00:28:44:16 --> 00:28:45:15
Can you tell me a

585
00:28:45:15 --> 00:28:48:15
bit of this cane

586
00:28:49:11 --> 00:28:51:19
and

587
00:28:51:19 --> 00:28:52:06
what is it?

588
00:28:52:06 --> 00:28:55:06
And also, can you also explain to me about the graph down there?

589
00:29:01:10 --> 00:29:06:05
This cane is a wararat or Wayúu palabrero cane,

590
00:29:06:05 --> 00:29:09:14
It is the one he uses to carry the word,

591
00:29:10:02 --> 00:29:14:03
It is a support point for the body, a support point for memory.

592
00:29:14:18 --> 00:29:17:11
It serves to point out someone in a process,

593
00:29:17:11 --> 00:29:19:15
You can't point your finger at it.

594
00:29:19:15 --> 00:29:22:03
Used to draw in the sand

595
00:29:22:03 --> 00:29:25:11
and to retain memory of the arguments

596
00:29:25:11 --> 00:29:27:17
That is he giving to the other party.

597
00:29:27:17 --> 00:29:31:14
This is the ground connection point,

598
00:29:32:03 --> 00:29:35:09
The Earth can convey through the message he must give.

599
00:29:35:22 --> 00:29:38:11
This is the weapon of the palabrero, because with this

600
00:29:38:11 --> 00:29:41:11
He defends himself against the dogs that bark on the roads.

601
00:29:41:11 --> 00:29:44:03
So these are the roles of the cane.

602
00:29:44:03 --> 00:29:46:19
This bird is called Utta,

603
00:29:46:19 --> 00:29:50:02
He was the first palabrero that existed in mythological times

604
00:29:50:09 --> 00:29:53:05
and he was the one who gave it to humans

605
00:29:53:05 --> 00:29:55:22
the principles of life, of the law on Earth,

606
00:29:55:22 --> 00:29:57:04
of the standards.

607
00:29:57:04 --> 00:30:00:07
And then the palabreros, who are they?

608
00:30:00:07 --> 00:30:00:19
What do they do?

609
00:30:00:19 --> 00:30:04:05
What is their role?
The role of palabreros is to be intermediaries,

610
00:30:04:11 --> 00:30:07:19
rhetoric specialists who know the Wayúu laws

611
00:30:08:06 --> 00:30:11:08
and mediate family disputes.

612
00:30:11:16 --> 00:30:15:08
Their role is to bring them to a peaceful settlement

613
00:30:15:18 --> 00:30:18:08
since they obtain compensation.

614
00:30:18:08 --> 00:30:22:14
It is the persuasive rhetoric that leads to peace.

615
00:30:23:01 --> 00:30:25:15
The cane is the vehicle of the word.

616
00:30:25:15 --> 00:30:27:07
It is known as this.

617
00:30:27:07 --> 00:30:30:07
That is the role and meaning that these canes have.

618
00:30:30:16 --> 00:30:31:07
And the,

619
00:30:32:10 --> 00:30:35:10
That system is not criminal, right?

620
00:30:36:12 --> 00:30:38:22
Is it a restorative system?
It is a non-punitive restorative system,

621
00:30:38:22 --> 00:30:42:18
because it does not seek to punish anyone, it seeks to compensate

622
00:30:42:18 --> 00:30:43:22
the fault committed

623
00:30:43:22 --> 00:30:45:12
through material

624
00:30:45:12 --> 00:30:46:05
and aesthetic elements

625
00:30:46:05 --> 00:30:50:03
like cattle, collars, even hand over the firearm

626
00:30:50:12 --> 00:30:53:12
that has caused a death, for example.

627
00:30:53:14 --> 00:30:56:10
In order to seek restoration

628
00:30:56:10 --> 00:30:58:03
of family relationships

629
00:30:58:03 --> 00:31:00:08
between families that are in dispute,

630
00:31:00:08 --> 00:31:03:09
not between two individuals, between sets

631
00:31:03:09 --> 00:31:06:09
relatives of those two individuals.

632
00:31:06:18 --> 00:31:09:16
And can you show me the symbol here?

633
00:31:09:16 --> 00:31:12:17
Here we have at the base of the cane,

634
00:31:13:09 --> 00:31:16:17
In this particular cane, there are many types of canes

635
00:31:16:17 --> 00:31:19:17
and they can be different, even made of different woods.

636
00:31:20:12 --> 00:31:24:13
The clan, the clan emblem of my, of my Uriana clan

637
00:31:25:00 --> 00:31:27:10
Yes, that is the iron or clan emblem

638
00:31:34:16 --> 00:31:37:16
Do you consider yourself a palabrero?

639
00:31:38:02 --> 00:31:41:17
No. Even though I have solved 223

640
00:31:41:17 --> 00:31:45:04
conflicts, throughout that,

641
00:31:45:04 --> 00:31:47:19
when I was Secretary of indigenous affairs,

642
00:31:47:19 --> 00:31:50:19
but I don't consider it because the word palabrero

643
00:31:50:19 --> 00:31:53:19
It means pütchipü, a person whose job is to speak.

644
00:31:54:00 --> 00:31:57:06
But there are words in a wayúnaiki like pütcheje'chi and

645
00:31:57:06 --> 00:32:00:02
is that sometimes settle disputes or Pütchejana,

646
00:32:00:02 --> 00:32:01:02
which is the messenger.

647
00:32:01:02 --> 00:32:04:06
So, I have intervened in many Wayúu disputes

648
00:32:04:15 --> 00:32:07:15
trying to mediate, but it's not my job.

649
00:32:07:16 --> 00:32:09:09
Okay.

650
00:32:09:09 --> 00:32:12:09
Can you show me that book,

651
00:32:14:13 --> 00:32:16:23
“El Cimarrón”?

652
00:32:16:23 --> 00:32:18:12
This book,

653
00:32:18:12 --> 00:32:22:01
It is a book of my authorship called El Mar Cimarrón,

654
00:32:22:19 --> 00:32:26:01
that explains the relationships of the Wayúu with the sea,

655
00:32:26:11 --> 00:32:29:11
their conceptualizations, their navigation ways,

656
00:32:29:16 --> 00:32:32:16
the relationship with fish, with turtles,

657
00:32:32:18 --> 00:32:33:16
with shrimp,

658
00:32:33:16 --> 00:32:35:20
with all marine beings, but also

659
00:32:35:20 --> 00:32:38:06
the landscape backgrounds in the sea,

660
00:32:38:06 --> 00:32:40:19
What are seascapes called?

661
00:32:40:19 --> 00:32:42:10
How they classify them,

662
00:32:42:10 --> 00:32:45:05
how they navigate and how they navigate through the stars,

663
00:32:45:05 --> 00:32:48:17
the constellations, the techniques, the fishing nets.

664
00:32:49:01 --> 00:32:52:05
Tries to explain the Wayúu system,

665
00:32:52:05 --> 00:32:55:05
in which fishing is marine cattle

666
00:32:55:09 --> 00:32:59:12
and therefore there is a relationship of the Wayuú

667
00:32:59:13 --> 00:33:01:07
with those marine cattle.

668
00:33:01:07 --> 00:33:04:12
The sea is like a meadow, an immense meadow

669
00:33:04:12 --> 00:33:06:07
where there are cattle and that animal,

670
00:33:06:07 --> 00:33:08:09
those cattle are the fish.

671
00:33:08:09 --> 00:33:09:10
And the symbols?

672
00:33:09:10 --> 00:33:12:12
This symbol is called jimeuiya,

673
00:33:12:12 --> 00:33:14:20
It means like the eye of the fish.

674
00:33:14:20 --> 00:33:17:13
It is in the Wayuú fabric, it is in

675
00:33:17:13 --> 00:33:20:23
Much of the Wayúu fabric are symbols of the sea.

676
00:33:20:23 --> 00:33:24:10
There are many other symbols of the sea that can be

677
00:33:25:19 --> 00:33:27:19
present in ceramics,

678
00:33:27:19 --> 00:33:30:19
not only in the fabric and

679
00:33:31:14 --> 00:33:33:17
All these symbols are very important.

680
00:33:33:17 --> 00:33:36:17
Here, for example, we have

681
00:33:36:23 --> 00:33:39:16
the snail, the crab,

682
00:33:39:16 --> 00:33:41:06
this is in wayúu ceramics

683
00:33:41:06 --> 00:33:44:06
and these are canoe decorations, they are painted,

684
00:33:44:06 --> 00:33:47:03
the canoes are made up like a flirtatious woman,

685
00:33:47:03 --> 00:33:48:07
in fact it is called süchepa.

686
00:33:48:07 --> 00:33:50:07
The makeup of the canoe,

687
00:33:50:07 --> 00:33:51:10
It is the face of the canoe

688
00:33:51:10 --> 00:33:53:06
That it adorned like a woman,

689
00:33:53:06 --> 00:33:56:19
Therefore the canoe is also painted and we can see it

690
00:33:56:19 --> 00:34:00:10
in the boats, in the different Wayúu boats.

691
00:34:00:19 --> 00:34:03:19
That canoe makeup.

692
00:34:04:00 --> 00:34:08:00
Yes, we can, we can see in the boats,

693
00:34:08:00 --> 00:34:09:10
which is an ornament.

694
00:34:09:10 --> 00:34:11:20
Yes Yes.

695
00:34:11:20 --> 00:34:14:00
This is.

696
00:34:14:00 --> 00:34:17:00
I don't know if there is another book that you want to show us.

697
00:34:17:01 --> 00:34:19:11
Well, this is my book of dispute (laughs)

698
00:34:21:23 --> 00:34:24:07
well this is a book

699
00:34:24:07 --> 00:34:27:11
about the Wayúu law and here we see the bird

700
00:34:27:11 --> 00:34:31:10
Utta who is also the first palabrero, the first pütchipü.

701
00:34:31:23 --> 00:34:33:03
and this book

702
00:34:33:03 --> 00:34:36:03
won the national prize for Culture in Colombia for Anthropology

703
00:34:36:17 --> 00:34:38:22
in the year 2000-2001

704
00:34:38:22 --> 00:34:41:21
and well, it was the first book I published

705
00:34:42:04 --> 00:34:44:23
and it has to do with all

706
00:34:44:23 --> 00:34:47:23
Wayúu palabreros and the Wayuú regulatory system.

707
00:34:48:05 --> 00:34:50:21
Here are the great palabreros of La Guajira.

708
00:34:50:21 --> 00:34:52:22
Many of these have already died,

709
00:34:52:22 --> 00:34:55:22
They existed and were very prestigious.

710
00:34:56:07 --> 00:34:59:16
Yeah.

711
00:35:09:18 --> 00:35:13:22
Here we have pulo'i de mar (of the Sea),

712
00:35:14:16 --> 00:35:18:10
Pulo'i de mar is the owner of the sea animals, she is very rich.

713
00:35:19:03 --> 00:35:22:03
To be able to access sea animals

714
00:35:22:09 --> 00:35:26:10
you have to give her some, do some rituals

715
00:35:26:10 --> 00:35:27:14
in which it is provided

716
00:35:27:14 --> 00:35:32:04
an aromatic resin called malambo, malambo in wayunaiki

717
00:35:32:04 --> 00:35:34:02
is called Alo'uka

718
00:35:34:02 --> 00:35:36:12
That malambo is also used by divers

719
00:35:36:12 --> 00:35:39:12
here to throw it when the sharks are around.

720
00:35:39:21 --> 00:35:43:04
If a person overfishes, she punishes them.

721
00:35:43:19 --> 00:35:46:14
That's why she doesn't like small turtles.

722
00:35:46:14 --> 00:35:49:20
nor abuse the fish, but take what is necessary

723
00:35:50:03 --> 00:35:53:03
to feed and to provide their family,

724
00:35:53:06 --> 00:35:56:00
but without abusing it, because those fish

725
00:35:56:00 --> 00:35:57:14
They are not from the fishermen,

726
00:35:57:14 --> 00:35:59:07
They are her cattle, of pulo'i (spirit) of the sea.

727
00:36:01:13 --> 00:36:04:03
is this here?

728
00:36:04:03 --> 00:36:07:03
Familiar? Yeah.

729
00:36:09:17 --> 00:36:12:10
Well, I wanted to know

730
00:36:12:10 --> 00:36:15:10
of the origin of the Wayúu people,

731
00:36:15:20 --> 00:36:18:11
where they have always been from, here?

732
00:36:18:11 --> 00:36:19:06
Correct.

733
00:36:19:06 --> 00:36:22:03
on the peninsula or?

734
00:36:31:06 --> 00:36:32:23
Well,

735
00:36:32:23 --> 00:36:33:16
the wayuú people

736
00:36:33:16 --> 00:36:35:05
speaks a language

737
00:36:35:05 --> 00:36:38:16
which belongs to the Arawak language family.

738
00:36:39:11 --> 00:36:42:17
The Arawak language family is an Amazonian family.

739
00:36:44:21 --> 00:36:47:00
Therefore,

740
00:36:47:00 --> 00:36:50:02
We know that the Wayúu migrated like many peoples

741
00:36:50:02 --> 00:36:53:02
who occupied the Caribbean, like the Taínos,

742
00:36:53:02 --> 00:36:56:08
like the Caquetíos, who also had Amazonian languages.

743
00:36:57:08 --> 00:37:00:03
Some of the Wayúu practices

744
00:37:00:03 --> 00:37:04:13
fishing with traps have Amazonian features.

745
00:37:04:13 --> 00:37:07:13
Much of its mythology is full of jaguar,

746
00:37:07:13 --> 00:37:12:15
of elements of that class and therefore it would seem

747
00:37:13:02 --> 00:37:15:00
that like many other towns that arrived

748
00:37:15:00 --> 00:37:16:23
the Caribbean have that origin.

749
00:37:16:23 --> 00:37:20:03
However, paleo archeologist and linguistics

750
00:37:20:03 --> 00:37:24:14
studies will have to show that, what that relationship is.

751
00:37:25:02 --> 00:37:27:15
But they are different from the language family

752
00:37:27:15 --> 00:37:30:22
of the people of the Sierra, who are a linguistic family

753
00:37:30:22 --> 00:37:33:22
chibcha, which come from Central America.

754
00:37:34:07 --> 00:37:37:00
Ok, so it's more likely that they came from the Amazon?

755
00:37:38:06 --> 00:37:39:10
It is more likely,

756
00:37:39:10 --> 00:37:42:10
in a process lasting many centuries

757
00:37:43:12 --> 00:37:45:03
and whether through the Orinoco,

758
00:37:45:03 --> 00:37:46:20
either through the Llanos,

759
00:37:46:20 --> 00:37:49:04
but they surely reached the peninsula.

760
00:37:49:04 --> 00:37:52:16
It is a process of centuries that archeology, linguistics

761
00:37:53:03 --> 00:37:54:10
will have to

762
00:37:54:10 --> 00:37:57:13
solve and study more clearly over time.

763
00:37:58:21 --> 00:38:01:08
And

764
00:38:01:08 --> 00:38:04:07
that one,

765
00:38:04:23 --> 00:38:07:23
the Wayuú

766
00:38:09:10 --> 00:38:10:06
well,

767
00:38:10:06 --> 00:38:13:06
they live in an almost desert place

768
00:38:14:16 --> 00:38:16:01
Obviously there are

769
00:38:16:01 --> 00:38:19:01
many reasons, because one cannot move,

770
00:38:19:11 --> 00:38:23:00
but is there a reason why they have stayed here or why

771
00:38:23:08 --> 00:38:26:07
do you keep that specific place?

772
00:38:26:10 --> 00:38:29:21
Well, like every human society, the Wayúu appropriated

773
00:38:29:21 --> 00:38:33:16
this territory, they dispersed throughout that territory

774
00:38:34:02 --> 00:38:37:17
and established an intimate relationship with this territory

775
00:38:38:03 --> 00:38:41:00
and I would say, with the different places

776
00:38:41:00 --> 00:38:44:15
that each family group considers its origin

777
00:38:45:02 --> 00:38:47:17
and to which it is associated, linked,

778
00:38:47:17 --> 00:38:52:11
through cemeteries, water sources, subsistence areas

779
00:38:52:11 --> 00:38:56:18
such as the sea or areas of pasture or animal hunting

780
00:38:57:01 --> 00:39:00:20
and the Wayúu have an intense relationship with those places.

781
00:39:01:07 --> 00:39:05:05
That's why they talk about ekii, territorial heads

782
00:39:06:00 --> 00:39:09:06
through which they came into the world, territorial roots

783
00:39:09:16 --> 00:39:12:13
where they consider themselves to have gone out into the world.

784
00:39:12:13 --> 00:39:14:19
There is an ontology of place

785
00:39:14:19 --> 00:39:18:01
and many times the Wayúu have an immense relationship,

786
00:39:18:07 --> 00:39:20:22
almost always with that place

787
00:39:20:22 --> 00:39:23:14
which is what in some way gives rise to life.

788
00:39:25:09 --> 00:39:27:13
And it is, speaking of that a little bit of that,

789
00:39:27:13 --> 00:39:30:23
can you tell me about the cemetery and the importance of

790
00:39:30:23 --> 00:39:33:23
for you?

791
00:39:33:23 --> 00:39:35:09
Well, family groups

792
00:39:35:09 --> 00:39:38:05
They have a principle they call precedence.

793
00:39:38:05 --> 00:39:40:17
The precedence is that in a territory

794
00:39:40:17 --> 00:39:42:09
There are those who arrived first,

795
00:39:42:09 --> 00:39:45:09
hundreds of years ago or dozens of years ago

796
00:39:45:10 --> 00:39:48:10
and they began to found the houses,

797
00:39:48:12 --> 00:39:51:08
water sources, roses for agriculture,

798
00:39:51:08 --> 00:39:52:20
agricultural areas

799
00:39:52:20 --> 00:39:56:01
and since they have died, the cemetery is accumulating

800
00:39:56:13 --> 00:39:59:00
in the sequence of generations

801
00:39:59:00 --> 00:40:01:15
that are a pact with the territory.

802
00:40:01:15 --> 00:40:05:12
To offer the bodies and at the same time legitimize the presence

803
00:40:05:22 --> 00:40:08:02
and the intimate relationship with that territory.

804
00:40:08:02 --> 00:40:11:16
So the cemeteries are like the Wayúu writings,

805
00:40:12:02 --> 00:40:14:09
the documents of a territory,

806
00:40:14:09 --> 00:40:16:01
because there are generations

807
00:40:16:01 --> 00:40:19:04
of human occupation that are accumulating,

808
00:40:19:10 --> 00:40:22:05
they feed, they form a memory,

809
00:40:22:05 --> 00:40:25:08
It is not only a memory in the mind,

810
00:40:25:17 --> 00:40:28:14
but it has physical evidence, such as bones

811
00:40:28:14 --> 00:40:29:08
of the ancestors.

812
00:40:30:21 --> 00:40:31:23
So that

813
00:40:31:23 --> 00:40:34:23
connection, that attraction like

814
00:40:35:05 --> 00:40:35:09
is it?

815
00:40:35:09 --> 00:40:38:19
How important is it to bury someone Wayúu?

816
00:40:40:00 --> 00:40:42:13
There are two types of importance.

817
00:40:42:13 --> 00:40:43:22
There are the first burials

818
00:40:43:22 --> 00:40:46:23
When a person dies unexpectedly,

819
00:40:47:09 --> 00:40:50:15
It could be due to an illness, it could be a war,

820
00:40:51:09 --> 00:40:54:03
an epidemic, an accident

821
00:40:54:03 --> 00:40:55:21
and the wake is held

822
00:40:55:21 --> 00:40:58:21
which is the most important social event of the Wayú.

823
00:40:58:23 --> 00:41:03:13
Animals are sacrificed, neighbors, relatives are invited

824
00:41:04:00 --> 00:41:07:23
and there they are. After a certain time, about ten, twelve years,

825
00:41:07:23 --> 00:41:08:12
eight years,

826
00:41:08:12 --> 00:41:12:03
may vary, the family prepares to remove the remains,

827
00:41:12:13 --> 00:41:15:10
accumulates animals, accumulates goods,

828
00:41:15:10 --> 00:41:17:22
start preparing the cemetery,

829
00:41:17:22 --> 00:41:21:00
make dwellings, bowers and make a second

830
00:41:21:00 --> 00:41:24:00
burial, in that second burial

831
00:41:24:05 --> 00:41:27:13
the body is separated from the meat from the bones and the bones

832
00:41:27:13 --> 00:41:31:07
They are kept again in the cemetery, in a special place

833
00:41:32:02 --> 00:41:34:08
wrapped with a special wrapper

834
00:41:34:08 --> 00:41:37:10
and a ritual as or more important than the first.

835
00:41:37:23 --> 00:41:41:14
That is a renewal of the pact with the territory

836
00:41:42:01 --> 00:41:45:19
and at the same time it is the dilution of the individual in something

837
00:41:45:19 --> 00:41:49:04
like the ancestors, in something collective

838
00:41:49:14 --> 00:41:53:00
which is very important, where your individual traits

839
00:41:53:06 --> 00:41:56:11
They begin to dilute and the collective begins to prevail.

840
00:41:58:13 --> 00:42:00:07
and do you have a cemetery?

841
00:42:00:07 --> 00:42:02:09
Definitely. It’s name is Manuyalu'u,

842
00:42:02:09 --> 00:42:05:09
It is in Carrizal and I have shown it

843
00:42:06:21 --> 00:42:11:00
in the books that I was able to show you yesterday.

844
00:42:11:13 --> 00:42:14:01
That was from my great-grandmother who is

845
00:42:14:01 --> 00:42:17:00
buried there, my grandmother, my great uncles.

846
00:42:17:10 --> 00:42:19:16
But, that cemetery

847
00:42:19:16 --> 00:42:22:16
It is later than an older cemetery

848
00:42:22:18 --> 00:42:26:10
which may be three, four centuries old.

849
00:42:26:18 --> 00:42:30:12
It is in Alta Guajira, since they migrated in the 19th century,

850
00:42:31:06 --> 00:42:33:14
to that territory,

851
00:42:33:14 --> 00:42:36:13
They established a new cemetery.

852
00:42:36:19 --> 00:42:39:05
And, they did not lose the relationship

853
00:42:39:05 --> 00:42:42:05
with the family that was in the old cemetery.

854
00:42:42:10 --> 00:42:45:10
And when there is conflict, disputes or funerals,

855
00:42:46:09 --> 00:42:48:11
connections between

856
00:42:48:11 --> 00:42:51:11
those territories and those relatives appear.

857
00:42:52:09 --> 00:42:55:03
Can you tell me

858
00:42:55:03 --> 00:42:58:03
of rain, the gender and role of rain?

859
00:42:58:18 --> 00:43:01:15
The rain,

860
00:43:01:15 --> 00:43:04:11
Juyá, it's winter,

861
00:43:04:11 --> 00:43:06:21
the heavy rains of October and November,

862
00:43:06:21 --> 00:43:09:12
At the same time it is a rainy season,

863
00:43:09:12 --> 00:43:13:04
He is a hyper masculine being who

864
00:43:14:14 --> 00:43:16:04
has hypostasis, that is,

865
00:43:16:04 --> 00:43:21:03
They have other beings that are, for example, iiwa or pamou,

866
00:43:21:03 --> 00:43:24:03
or there are several that involve rain.

867
00:43:24:23 --> 00:43:27:23
That hyper masculine being is the one that fertilizes the Earth

868
00:43:28:17 --> 00:43:32:10
and gives life to the earth so that the earth can

869
00:43:32:20 --> 00:43:36:09
give more humans, more trees, more animals.

870
00:43:36:16 --> 00:43:38:23
Fertility itself.

871
00:43:38:23 --> 00:43:42:08
In summer the earth falls into a faint,

872
00:43:42:08 --> 00:43:45:23
like a woman, lifeless, falls lifeless, almost lifeless

873
00:43:46:12 --> 00:43:50:11
and with rain, with Juyá who fertilizes her, her husband,

874
00:43:50:11 --> 00:43:54:16
she revives, is brought to life again and the vital cycle

875
00:43:55:04 --> 00:43:58:04
of all living beings returns.

876
00:43:58:04 --> 00:44:01:21
That is why Juyá is a hyper masculine being, mobile like the rain.

877
00:44:02:15 --> 00:44:05:22
The rain that there is also iiwa, another type of minor rain

878
00:44:05:22 --> 00:44:07:23
that there can be feminine and masculine,

879
00:44:08:23 --> 00:44:11:23
implies a gradualness in the way of falling

880
00:44:12:03 --> 00:44:15:07
and a sequence in the lands that must be watered.

881
00:44:15:18 --> 00:44:17:02
The Wayuú

882
00:44:17:02 --> 00:44:20:04
They are always governed by the notion of order,

883
00:44:20:17 --> 00:44:22:02
that things,

884
00:44:22:02 --> 00:44:26:05
phenomena have an order to follow, a protocol

885
00:44:26:15 --> 00:44:31:18
and a sequence and gradualness that manages intensity.

886
00:44:32:07 --> 00:44:35:01
If it rains very hard on plants

887
00:44:35:01 --> 00:44:38:16
small, tiny, this rain is going to destroy them.

888
00:44:38:16 --> 00:44:41:16
That is equivalent to rape of a woman.

889
00:44:41:17 --> 00:44:45:00
For this reason, rain is always asked to be gradual.

890
00:44:45:07 --> 00:44:46:01
and an order,

891
00:44:46:01 --> 00:44:49:04
a sequence of lands that must reach first,

892
00:44:49:10 --> 00:44:52:10
others later and others finally.

893
00:45:16:18 --> 00:45:18:17
Well, the

894
00:45:18:17 --> 00:45:22:04
garden of life, the garden of the jungle, the garden

895
00:45:22:04 --> 00:45:26:14
as a meeting place for humans and non-humans.

896
00:45:30:04 --> 00:45:33:04
The world is seen as a crop.

897
00:45:33:22 --> 00:45:34:21
The forests

898
00:45:34:21 --> 00:45:36:06
They are a culture of beings

899
00:45:36:06 --> 00:45:39:05
like Juya, winter,

900
00:45:39:15 --> 00:45:41:11
the wild trees,

901
00:45:41:11 --> 00:45:44:11
wild fruits are products

902
00:45:44:14 --> 00:45:47:15
of Juya's will to cultivate (the rain)

903
00:45:48:07 --> 00:45:51:10
The human garden, where the corn is, the watermelon,

904
00:45:51:10 --> 00:45:53:03
the beans, the pumpkin,

905
00:45:53:03 --> 00:45:54:18
They are the crops of humans,

906
00:45:54:18 --> 00:45:55:04
In this way,

907
00:45:55:04 --> 00:45:58:19
the entire universe corresponds to an order of a cultivation,

908
00:45:59:04 --> 00:46:02:04
humans and crops of mythological beings.

909
00:46:02:04 --> 00:46:04:18
So therefore there is no separation

910
00:46:04:18 --> 00:46:06:21
because everything has an order.

911
00:46:06:21 --> 00:46:10:03
The garden implies a relationship with many

912
00:46:10:03 --> 00:46:13:06
beings, it is a stage, the garden is like a theater

913
00:46:13:23 --> 00:46:16:23
and the actors are humans,

914
00:46:17:04 --> 00:46:21:02
vegetable seeds, butterflies, worms,

915
00:46:22:00 --> 00:46:24:02
the monkeys, the flies,

916
00:46:24:02 --> 00:46:27:02
insects like bees,

917
00:46:27:15 --> 00:46:29:19
the birds that eat the crops,

918
00:46:29:19 --> 00:46:33:08
the monkeys, the wild pigs.

919
00:46:33:08 --> 00:46:35:20
Everyone intervenes in the garden.

920
00:46:35:20 --> 00:46:39:10
So each moment of a being has its appearance

921
00:46:39:16 --> 00:46:41:03
like in a drama.

922
00:46:41:03 --> 00:46:43:14
So the garden is a polyphonic drama,

923
00:46:43:14 --> 00:46:43:21
And there they

924
00:46:43:21 --> 00:46:46:19
coexist in a collaborative, harmonious way,

925
00:46:46:19 --> 00:46:48:03
but also antagonistic

926
00:46:48:03 --> 00:46:50:13
humans and other species,

927
00:46:50:13 --> 00:46:52:14
It is not a mere vegetable manipulation.

928
00:46:53:13 --> 00:46:56:13
That is the garden for the Wayuú.

929
00:48:28:08 --> 00:48:29:18
Well,

930
00:48:29:18 --> 00:48:32:20
many in the Western world

931
00:48:33:19 --> 00:48:35:21
treat the Earth,

932
00:48:35:21 --> 00:48:39:19
natural resources as something that can be extracted,

933
00:48:39:21 --> 00:48:42:04
something that can be exploited.

934
00:48:42:04 --> 00:48:45:23
What would be a lesson from the Wayuú

935
00:48:46:04 --> 00:48:49:04
about that?

936
00:48:49:05 --> 00:48:49:19
The Wayuú

937
00:48:49:19 --> 00:48:52:21
They have a notion that somehow

938
00:48:53:13 --> 00:48:55:22
the elements found

939
00:48:55:22 --> 00:48:58:22
Both on land and in the sea they have owners.

940
00:48:59:04 --> 00:49:02:04
Animals have owners, the deer, the rabbit,

941
00:49:02:10 --> 00:49:05:02
Hunting animals have an owner.

942
00:49:05:02 --> 00:49:07:23
To access them you must ask for permission.

943
00:49:07:23 --> 00:49:09:02
through rituals

944
00:49:09:02 --> 00:49:12:07
to the owners of these animals and not take them in excess.

945
00:49:13:07 --> 00:49:17:00
Those animals are relatives and, in the sea, likewise

946
00:49:17:13 --> 00:49:19:11
It’s not full of natural strangers,

947
00:49:19:11 --> 00:49:22:19
It's full of relatives from whom we can take

948
00:49:22:19 --> 00:49:24:17
What we need to feed ourselves,

949
00:49:24:17 --> 00:49:26:06
But by also asking permission from

950
00:49:26:06 --> 00:49:29:06
Pulo'i who is the owner of those animals.

951
00:49:29:12 --> 00:49:32:02
These are relationships of

952
00:49:32:02 --> 00:49:34:13
in some way reciprocity.

953
00:49:34:13 --> 00:49:37:11
The Wayuú say, when I'm hungry, says a fisherman,

954
00:49:37:11 --> 00:49:40:02
I go to the sea, I take an animal and I eat it.

955
00:49:40:02 --> 00:49:41:23
They are safe at sea.

956
00:49:41:23 --> 00:49:45:16
The sea is the meadow, the corral of the animals

957
00:49:46:01 --> 00:49:49:22
and on land there are protective relationships with the sheep,

958
00:49:49:22 --> 00:49:52:06
goats, which are animals

959
00:49:52:06 --> 00:49:54:01
that are under the control of humans.

960
00:49:54:01 --> 00:49:56:20
But humans also lose their autonomy

961
00:49:56:20 --> 00:49:59:04
when they have animals under their control,

962
00:49:59:04 --> 00:50:00:17
They have to take them to pasture,

963
00:50:00:17 --> 00:50:03:14
They have to take him to water, to drink water

964
00:50:03:14 --> 00:50:05:04
If they are sick, take care of them,

965
00:50:05:04 --> 00:50:07:13
then both lose their autonomy.

966
00:50:07:13 --> 00:50:08:07
Somehow,

967
00:50:08:07 --> 00:50:11:07
the sheep also control the shepherds.

968
00:50:11:07 --> 00:50:14:00
So it is the Wayúu vision of that, of the world.

969
00:50:14:00 --> 00:50:16:20
The fisherman privileges his freedom

970
00:50:16:20 --> 00:50:18:09
to be a free being in the world

971
00:50:18:09 --> 00:50:20:22
Like fish that are free, they are not confined.

972
00:50:21:22 --> 00:50:22:21
The Shepherd

973
00:50:22:21 --> 00:50:26:02
restricts their autonomy as a human and that of other

974
00:50:26:15 --> 00:50:29:15
non-human beings who are under their protection.

975
00:50:29:16 --> 00:50:32:16
So it's the world view of that.

976
00:50:32:16 --> 00:50:35:16
But at no point is the natural seen as strange.

977
00:50:35:22 --> 00:50:38:22
It is always seen as part of an order

978
00:50:39:22 --> 00:50:43:04
in which the human is one of the living forms

979
00:50:43:17 --> 00:50:47:05
and eats the animals because it is subsistence,

980
00:50:47:05 --> 00:50:48:21
but you have to ask permission

981
00:50:48:21 --> 00:50:51:21
in some way to be able to take advantage.

982
00:50:52:00 --> 00:50:53:08
How does one ask for permission?

983
00:50:53:08 --> 00:50:56:08
Permissions are requested through rituals, in some way

984
00:50:56:18 --> 00:50:59:22
When the Wayúu use malambo in fishing

985
00:51:00:08 --> 00:51:03:08
and prepare infusions and

986
00:51:04:02 --> 00:51:06:20
They narrate or make a spell, they tell Pulo'i

987
00:51:06:20 --> 00:51:07:17
“here I bring you.

988
00:51:07:17 --> 00:51:09:23
Don't say I didn't bring you anything:

989
00:51:09:23 --> 00:51:14:05
Here you have this aromatic resin”, they throw it into the sea

990
00:51:14:05 --> 00:51:16:09
or rub it on fishing nets

991
00:51:16:09 --> 00:51:18:10
so that she can give them fish.

992
00:51:18:10 --> 00:51:21:04
It is a vision that there is a system

993
00:51:21:04 --> 00:51:25:17
and they are part of that and they need authorization

994
00:51:25:17 --> 00:51:28:17
to take those animals

995
00:51:29:00 --> 00:51:30:14
that are their subsistence,

996
00:51:30:14 --> 00:51:32:09
but which cannot be abused.

997
00:51:32:09 --> 00:51:33:11
How different it would be

998
00:51:33:11 --> 00:51:36:07
yes all industrial fishermen

999
00:51:37:12 --> 00:51:40:12
before doing that they would ask

1000
00:51:41:16 --> 00:51:43:05
permission.
That's correct.

1001
00:51:43:05 --> 00:51:46:05
Even when they are going to take the pottery

1002
00:51:46:06 --> 00:51:49:12
From the land to make the vessels, they cannot take it like that,

1003
00:51:50:08 --> 00:51:53:08
just because the land is common or abundant.

1004
00:51:53:18 --> 00:51:56:23
The women who make Wayúu ceramics,

1005
00:51:56:23 --> 00:52:01:14
They carry coffee, they carry rice or other food.

1006
00:52:01:22 --> 00:52:06:00
and first they prepare this in honor of the land, of Mma,

1007
00:52:06:08 --> 00:52:10:02
to be able to take that element and turn it into clay,

1008
00:52:10:10 --> 00:52:11:19
turn it into ceramics.

1009
00:52:11:19 --> 00:52:16:16
There is always a prior ritual, a request for permission

1010
00:52:16:16 --> 00:52:19:16
before proceeding to take an appeal.

1011
00:52:20:21 --> 00:52:22:14
Well, I think that

1012
00:52:22:14 --> 00:52:25:13
the last thing I wanted to ask here, because it's something

1013
00:52:25:14 --> 00:52:28:14
a little hard to understand, it's Wayúu time

1014
00:52:29:21 --> 00:52:31:04
Yeah.

1015
00:52:31:04 --> 00:52:34:04
Why is it different from Western time?

1016
00:52:34:11 --> 00:52:35:19
That’s correct.

1017
00:52:35:19 --> 00:52:38:16
The Wayúu have complex notions of time,

1018
00:52:38:16 --> 00:52:40:20
because time is the horizon

1019
00:52:40:20 --> 00:52:43:04
for the understanding of being.

1020
00:52:43:04 --> 00:52:44:10
This phrase was said by Martin Heidegger,

1021
00:52:45:11 --> 00:52:47:23
but the Wayúu believe it the same

1022
00:52:47:23 --> 00:52:52:05
because they understand that first there is a referential time,

1023
00:52:53:03 --> 00:52:54:01
What does it mean?

1024
00:52:54:01 --> 00:52:55:17
that this time implies a protocol

1025
00:52:55:17 --> 00:52:58:23
of the correct way to eat, dress and behave.

1026
00:52:59:14 --> 00:53:03:08
That referential time is universal humanity,

1027
00:53:03:22 --> 00:53:07:02
the undifferentiation of beings, but which then comes

1028
00:53:07:02 --> 00:53:08:14
a transformative time

1029
00:53:08:14 --> 00:53:11:03
in which the beings changed their appearance.

1030
00:53:11:03 --> 00:53:14:07
And these relatives, like plants, their arms

1031
00:53:14:07 --> 00:53:17:16
They became branches, their legs into stems and roots.

1032
00:53:18:01 --> 00:53:20:08
And all this. And that the animals,

1033
00:53:20:08 --> 00:53:24:07
because they were punished for breaking social norms,

1034
00:53:24:16 --> 00:53:26:17
for their obsessions

1035
00:53:26:17 --> 00:53:29:17
with meat or other types of resources,

1036
00:53:29:21 --> 00:53:31:19
or for being shy like deer,

1037
00:53:31:19 --> 00:53:33:11
They were so scary,

1038
00:53:33:11 --> 00:53:36:06
They lived in so much fear that they were converted humans

1039
00:53:36:06 --> 00:53:39:04
in deer, or for war like the jaguar.

1040
00:53:39:04 --> 00:53:42:11
Then the world had a differentiation

1041
00:53:42:11 --> 00:53:43:13
of morphological features.

1042
00:53:45:07 --> 00:53:46:05
This is one

1043
00:53:46:05 --> 00:53:49:05
notion of time, and they have everyday social time,

1044
00:53:49:08 --> 00:53:52:18
the time that is measured in moons, in winter seasons,

1045
00:53:53:05 --> 00:53:56:05
in the duration of the sunlight, in the moon,

1046
00:53:56:12 --> 00:53:59:12
They handle the lunar phases a lot.

1047
00:53:59:17 --> 00:54:02:14
The fishermen, the dark time of the moon,

1048
00:54:02:14 --> 00:54:04:21
moonlight time marks

1049
00:54:04:21 --> 00:54:06:18
fishing activities.

1050
00:54:06:18 --> 00:54:10:21
But there are also social calendars such as wakes,

1051
00:54:11:10 --> 00:54:14:13
certain events, disputes, everything, funerals,

1052
00:54:14:13 --> 00:54:17:06
All this marks social time.

1053
00:54:17:06 --> 00:54:18:15
The West has introduced

1054
00:54:18:15 --> 00:54:21:22
the notions of Christmas, of the end of the year too

1055
00:54:22:09 --> 00:54:25:19
and states have introduced election time.

1056
00:54:26:02 --> 00:54:28:21
The electoral calendars that are somehow

1057
00:54:28:21 --> 00:54:31:21
holiday-like processes

1058
00:54:32:13 --> 00:54:34:19
and who have competitions for power

1059
00:54:34:19 --> 00:54:36:03
in a society that is next

1060
00:54:36:03 --> 00:54:38:06
but that influences theirs,

1061
00:54:38:06 --> 00:54:40:22
because they live in a semi-autonomous social field,

1062
00:54:40:22 --> 00:54:42:13
then they also have relationships

1063
00:54:42:13 --> 00:54:45:12
with those systems of government power.

1064
00:54:45:18 --> 00:54:48:18
So the Wayúu live in a heterochronic time,

1065
00:54:49:01 --> 00:54:53:01
In other words, they have this daily social time next to them,

1066
00:54:53:19 --> 00:54:56:05
they have those times

1067
00:54:56:05 --> 00:54:59:08
referential, those transformative times

1068
00:55:00:16 --> 00:55:03:16
that cannot be placed in the past.

1069
00:55:03:21 --> 00:55:06:23
So this heterochromia coexists in the Wayúu world.
