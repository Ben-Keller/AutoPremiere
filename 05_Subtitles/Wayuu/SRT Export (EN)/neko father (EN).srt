1
00:10 --> 00:17
I am from the Ayalajose community

2
00:18 --> 00:23
It is in the territory of Alta Guajira (North Region)

3
00:24 --> 00:31
Right now I am close to the community
in the jaguey (lake) ichiiket

4
00:33 --> 00:37
My name is Agustin Pushaina

5
00:40 --> 00:46
Now I am going to tell you everything related
with water and rain (mythological father of the Wayuu)

6
00:51 --> 00:55
As for Juya (rain) it is very important to us,

7
00:57 --> 01:00
He is the one who gives us good things

8
01:02 --> 01:08
The one that gives us a hope of life, things
what we need for day to day

9
01:10 --> 01:13
And the things our children need to survive

10
01:14 --> 01:16
Furthermore, in order for the land to produce
food for us

11
01:17 --> 01:21
how do they know when winter is coming?

12
01:25 --> 01:30
the month in which the rain comes iwaa appears
(star) As a sign in the sky

13
01:33 --> 01:38
In addition, another sign are the dragonflies that appear
before the torrential waters

14
01:40 --> 01:45
If the rain comes in that month of signs,
means that enough water is going to fall

15
01:46 --> 01:48
We look at the sky when the rain starts to fall

16
01:50 --> 01:53
The earth is happy and so are we

17
01:56 --> 01:59
Why are we happy?

18
02:00 --> 02:04
because there will be abundant food for us
And grass for the animals

19
02:05 --> 02:07
They are things that we will survive

20
02:09 --> 02:13
It is a lie to say that the Wayuu live well

21
02:14 --> 02:17
Because we don't have how to get up in difficult times

22
00:18 --> 00:24
Only when the rain comes because with it, we have water,
food, vegetation for animals and so on.

23
02:25 --> 02:28
Our house comes from him

24
02:29 --> 02:33
Thanks to Juya the teasels bear good fruit in quantity

25
02:34 --> 02:39
The plants appear in quantity

26
02:40 --> 02:45
With Juya all things are productive like sowing,
Like the animals that feed us

27
02:46 --> 02:48
We put a big corral for them

28
02:49 --> 02:52
That is why we feed ourselves thanks to water

29
02:53 --> 00:59
That's why we need the rain to come in the
month of the star because it is very necessary to live.

30
03:00 --> 03:05
If the rain does not come in the month of iiwa (star),
We face many difficulties

31
03:06 --> 03:11
The land dries up, there is no water, and nothing to eat
in our land

32
03:12 --> 03:14
In those moments we do not know how to handle the situation

33
03:15 --> 03:20
We try to bring the apain (orchard) closer to sow food,
But the scorching sun destroys the crops

34
03:21 --> 03:26
That is why we need the rain, which
we are talking now

35
03:27 --> 03:33
Now let's talk about what was life like for people when the rain was abundant?

36
03:34 --> 03:38
before when the rain was abundant everything was fine

37
03:40 --> 03:46
when my ancestors inhabited the earth
Juya's rain was abundant

38
03:47 --> 03:53
Even in moments of celebrations (myrrh) there was rain,
Happened at the end of the year

39
03:54 --> 03:56
After the end of the year it rained again

40
03:57 --> 04:02
During the celebration people had many
animals thanks to Juya

41
04:03 --> 04:09
The Wayuu began to mark the animals with the
eirüku (family clan) to differentiate them and
know how many animals the rain left

42
04:11 --> 04:18
This mark served to leave the inheritance to his children and relatives,
Through the eirüku each person knew what was theirs.

43
04:20 --> 04:24
the inheritance was delivered when the rain stopped for a moment

44
04:25 --> 04:29
After that the month of iiwa was approaching
and Juya visited us again

45
04:30 --> 04:35
Small animals grow quickly
Because the rain makes the plants grow again

46
04:36 --> 04:38
In addition, the water is good for everything, to bathe

47
04:39 --> 04:44
To plant food such as corn, beans,

48
04:45 --> 04:49
the watermelon and the pumpkin.

49
04:50 --> 04:53
In the garden they could sow what they wanted to eat

50
04:54 --> 04:59
The wayuu who did not have animals or crops,
He approached where a person who did have

51
05:01 --> 05:06
He suddenly asked for help because he had no food at home

52
05:07 --> 05:11
The sower told him "it's okay, I'll help you", he showed him the
trade on how to sow, clean and harvest.

53
05:12 --> 05:15
Or he gives him a part of the garden so that he can sow
his own food

54
05:16 --> 05:19
We help each other for good

55
05:20 --> 05:25
So the earth is good, with only rain three times
There is already plenty of food, and we all have many animals

56
05:26 --> 05:31
The life of our ancestors had many benefits
Because Juya's rain was abundant

57
05:32 --> 05:39
They had cows, goats, sheep and other animals
like donkeys and horses

58
05:41 --> 05:47
Those were the benefits my ancestors had
When the rain made love to mother earth.

59
05:49 --> 05:52
At that time all the territories were in
equal conditions

60
05:53 --> 05:58
There was no land where it did not rain

61
06:00 --> 06:04
When there was a conflict, they met.
among all and thought of a solution

62
06:05 --> 06:08
They managed the situation and reassured those affected.
It was resolved by means of a payment

63
06:09 --> 06:13
Since they all had animals it was very easy to give
solution to the conflict as soon as possible

64
06:14 --> 06:17
the wayuu did not care how many animals he had to give
because there was enough

65
06:18 --> 06:22
Animals were an asset in those days,
That they ended some conflict.

66
06:23 --> 06:26
Thanks to animals in abundance there was no theft

67
06:27 --> 06:30
There was respect and a healthy coexistence among the Wayuu

68
06:31 --> 06:35
They all lived together on earth without any problem,
Neighboring territories were like families

69
06:36 --> 06:40
This was possible thanks to the fact that they all had animals in abundance,
And they helped each other

70
06:41 --> 06:45
The one who did not have crops asked and the others gave him gifts,
Because no one denied anything

71
06:46 --> 06:52
The one who did not have crops exchanged something for food and
so they helped each other.

72
06:53 --> 06:59
Now let's talk about the needs due to the lack of water

73
07:03 --> 07:07
Right now there is no longer a healthy coexistence

74
07:08 --> 07:14
Good friendships among people no longer exist, and the exchange of goods is something that is no longer seen

75
07:15 --> 07:18
Water is very necessary, it is what guides us on the right path

76
07:19 --> 07:23
It would be a lie if we say that we are
Good-hearted people

77
07:24 --> 07:26
If there is no rain there is nothing good

78
07:27 --> 07:29
The wayuu wait for the rain,
To the point of sadness

79
07:30 --> 07:36
They are forced to go to distant places near the
mountains to fetch water

80
07:37 --> 07:44
They take the animals there, and if they have several on the way,
they get lost because they are territories they are unfamiliar with

81
07:45 --> 07:49
And the people over there eat the animals
lost on the way

82
07:50 --> 07:53
It is a very great suffering when there is no rain

83
07:54 --> 07:57
Because of that they are envious between relatives

84
07:58 --> 08:02
If a Wayuu grazes a few goats, the rest get upset.

85
08:03 --> 08:09
That happens due to the lack of water, because the water
brought good life to all

86
08:11 --> 08:16
for animals, people, children,
Because they all drink water

87
08:17 --> 08:22
Because it is from water that food is sown,
If there is no water, what will there be?

88
08:23 --> 08:28
For example, this little bit of water that is here in the jaguey
When it runs out or dries up you won't see anything

89
08:29 --> 08:34
Even if I try to dig a hole under the jagüey with suffering,
So be it for a little water it would be in vain

90
08:35 --> 08:39
Meanwhile, he is thinking of a mill or a water well
that is miles from here

91
08:40 --> 08:45
Even if the Wayuu travels several kilometers to
get to the place even for a jug of water

92
08:46 --> 08:49
Why is it necessary for you to help people with water?

93
08:50 --> 08:55
It is necessary to ask for help from the earth and from you, the Arijunas.

94
08:56 --> 08:59
because you work with water that comes from afar

95
09:01 --> 09:07
They work so that water reaches the villages

96
09:09 --> 09:12
We are waiting for you to help us too

97
09:13 --> 09:16
To ask that they bring us water here in the house from there

98
09:17 --> 09:21
Because if there is water, our traditions of
a healthy coexistence

99
09:22 --> 09:28
Return of abundance in food,
planting and sharing with others

100
09:29 --> 09:32
People relate to each other
in the communities

101
09:33 --> 09:38
Why are we so envious?, for the
lack of water, it is something very necessary for us

102
09:39 --> 09:44
For example, if water aid arrives in a neighboring community
give away a mill or a mini aqueduct

103
09:45 --> 09:51
Here they must also give the same, as well as in the others,
because that way we would all have water without any problem

104
09:52 --> 09:55
With that help we can rebuild many things

105
09:56 --> 10:00
what our ancestors did with plenty of rain.

106
10:01 --> 10:05
And another life expectancy?

107
10:06 --> 10:11
So why do we run to what is called town?

108
10:12 --> 10:16
Because we want the town hall to help us

109
10:17 --> 10:20
They would help us with good things

110
10:21 --> 10:24
like water, because water provides us with everything

111
10:25 --> 10:31
He is the one who gives food, animals

112
10:32 --> 10:34
The one who gives good friends too

113
10:36 --> 10:40
Everything we need we build with water

114
10:41 --> 10:46
Because we know how to use it since ancient times
Because we grew up in nature,

115
10:47 --> 10:49
and we know many things

116
10:50 --> 10:53
That's why kids didn't get sick before

117
10:54 --> 10:57
That's why there was no mistreatment between us

118
11:00 --> 11:06
When there was water we helped each other

119
11:07 --> 11:12
We built a very large apain (orchard)
where we grow food

120
11:14 --> 11:19
We planted food in quantity such as beans

121
11:20 --> 11:25
Corn, sideburns, pumpkin among others.

122
11:26 --> 11:31
Our relatives, nephews and close people arrived
To help each other in the construction

123
11:33 --> 11:39
that's where there was opportunity for life, where each one
I harvested a sack of beans

124
11:40 --> 11:43
He took it to exchange for other goods.

125
11:44 --> 11:46
So they gave him something for the exchange

126
11:47 --> 11:51
Our little children

127
11:53 --> 11:56
They had the milk of our animals

128
11:57 --> 12:00
Like the goat, the sheep or the cow, if we have animals

129
12:02 --> 12:07
They extract it to make cheese by pressing it

130
12:08 --> 12:13
It was also used to drink it and for children to drink it

131
12:14 --> 12:18
It was very good because it did not bring disease, all
We drank it until we were satisfied

132
12:19 --> 12:22
So they all worked in the garden

133
12:23 --> 12:25
Each one contributed to the construction and planting

134
12:26 --> 12:30
If something happens, we all contribute
We always have something to pay

135
12:31 --> 12:36
Future conflicts may come, which may commit
our nephews, grandchildren or a member of the family

136
12:37 --> 12:39
Or the person who asks us for help, who lives with us
here in the community

137
12:40 --> 12:42
in this way of living.

138
12:43 --> 12:45
Can you clarify that again?

139
12:46 --> 12:49
He said that if they give us water he will not see disease

140
12:50 --> 12:53
On earth everything would be alright

141
12:54 --> 12:59
If the arijunas of the city help us

142
13:00 --> 13:03
We'd love to hear about starving children.

143
13:04 --> 13:08
Children who say they die from malnutrition

144
13:09 --> 13:12
It is because of the bad life that there is and the lack of food

145
13:13 --> 13:18
His mother does not have enough food to
produce milk for a baby

146
13:19 --> 13:22
In addition to the lack of resources in the children's house

147
13:25 --> 13:30
There are days when children go hungry and eat at the time they
find food

148
13:31 --> 13:36
because food is scarce
That's why children get sick

149
13:38 --> 13:43
For example, if they deliver the water that comes from the town

150
13:44 --> 13:49
You won't see children dying

151
13:50 --> 13:53
The earth will be composed as in ancient times

152
13:54 --> 13:58
That's why we need the water
Above all things.

153
13:59 --> 14:03
Done. Why do we have good material?

154
14:04 --> 14:09
For example, this water that you are seeing
It is what we drink now

155
14:11 --> 14:17
Why do we drink it?, because we don't have any
Drinking water near here

156
14:18 --> 14:21
That's why we use this water, we come looking for it
And we take it to our homes

157
14:22 --> 14:26
The town is too far from here to be able to go get water

158
14:27 --> 14:32
In addition, a transport is needed to bring it from there and
we don't have that

159
14:33 --> 14:37
When this water runs out we will suffer a lot

160
14:38 --> 14:43
This is the water we're drinking while it lasts,
That's why we need you to help us

161
14:44 --> 14:48
If the world sees us, they would help with the water we need

162
14:49 --> 14:51
Then we would no longer have to drink from this jaguey

163
14:52 --> 14:54
Our life would change.
