1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I am from the Ayalajose community

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It is in the territory of Alta Guajira (North Region)

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Right now I am close to the community
in the jaguey (lake) ichiiket

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
My name is Agustin Pushaina

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now I am going to tell you everything related
with water and rain (mythological father of the Wayuu)

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
As for Juya (rain) it is very important to us,

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He is the one who gives us good things

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The one that gives us a hope of life, things
what we need for day to day

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And the things our children need to survive

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Furthermore, in order for the land to produce
food for us

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
how do they know when winter is coming?

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the month in which the rain comes iwaa appears
(star) As a sign in the sky

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In addition, another sign are the dragonflies that appear
before the torrential waters

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
If the rain comes in that month of signs,
means that enough water is going to fall

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We look at the sky when the rain starts to fall

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The earth is happy and so are we

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Why are we happy?

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
because there will be abundant food for us
And grass for the animals

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They are things that we will survive

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It is a lie to say that the Wayuu live well

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Because we don't have how to get up in difficult times

22
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Only when the rain comes because with it, we have water,
food, vegetation for animals and so on.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Our house comes from him

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Thanks to Juya the teasels bear good fruit in quantity

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The plants appear in quantity

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
With Juya all things are productive like sowing,
Like the animals that feed us

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We put a big corral for them

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That is why we feed ourselves thanks to water

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's why we need the rain to come in the
month of the star because it is very necessary to live.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If the rain does not come in the month of iiwa (star),
We face many difficulties

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The land dries up, there is no water, and nothing to eat
in our land

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
In those moments we do not know how to handle the situation

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We try to bring the apain (orchard) closer to sow food,
But the scorching sun destroys the crops

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That is why we need the rain, which
we are talking now

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Now let's talk about what was life like for people when the rain was abundant?

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
before when the rain was abundant everything was fine

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
when my ancestors inhabited the earth
Juya's rain was abundant

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Even in moments of celebrations (myrrh) there was rain,
Happened at the end of the year

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
After the end of the year it rained again

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
During the celebration people had many
animals thanks to Juya

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The Wayuu began to mark the animals with the
eirüku (family clan) to differentiate them and
know how many animals the rain left

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This mark served to leave the inheritance to his children and relatives,
Through the eirüku each person knew what was theirs.

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
the inheritance was delivered when the rain stopped for a moment

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
After that the month of iiwa was approaching
and Juya visited us again

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Small animals grow quickly
Because the rain makes the plants grow again

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
In addition, the water is good for everything, to bathe

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
To plant food such as corn, beans,

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
the watermelon and the pumpkin.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
In the garden they could sow what they wanted to eat

50
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The wayuu who did not have animals or crops,
He approached where a person who did have

51
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He suddenly asked for help because he had no food at home

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The sower told him "it's okay, I'll help you", he showed him the
trade on how to sow, clean and harvest.

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Or he gives him a part of the garden so that he can sow
his own food

54
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We help each other for good

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So the earth is good, with only rain three times
There is already plenty of food, and we all have many animals

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The life of our ancestors had many benefits
Because Juya's rain was abundant

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
They had cows, goats, sheep and other animals
like donkeys and horses

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Those were the benefits my ancestors had
When the rain made love to mother earth.

59
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
At that time all the territories were in
equal conditions

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
There was no land where it did not rain

61
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
When there was a conflict, they met.
among all and thought of a solution

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
They managed the situation and reassured those affected.
It was resolved by means of a payment

63
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Since they all had animals it was very easy to give
solution to the conflict as soon as possible

64
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
the wayuu did not care how many animals he had to give
because there was enough

65
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Animals were an asset in those days,
That they ended some conflict.

66
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Thanks to animals in abundance there was no theft

67
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
There was respect and a healthy coexistence among the Wayuu

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
They all lived together on earth without any problem,
Neighboring territories were like families

69
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This was possible thanks to the fact that they all had animals in abundance,
And they helped each other

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The one who did not have crops asked and the others gave him gifts,
Because no one denied anything

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The one who did not have crops exchanged something for food and
so they helped each other.

72
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Now let's talk about the needs due to the lack of water

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Right now there is no longer a healthy coexistence

74
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Good friendships among people no longer exist, and the exchange of goods is something that is no longer seen

75
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Water is very necessary, it is what guides us on the right path

76
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It would be a lie if we say that we are
Good-hearted people

77
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
If there is no rain there is nothing good

78
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The wayuu wait for the rain,
To the point of sadness

79
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They are forced to go to distant places near the
mountains to fetch water

80
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
They take the animals there, and if they have several on the way,
they get lost because they are territories they are unfamiliar with

81
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And the people over there eat the animals
lost on the way

82
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It is a very great suffering when there is no rain

83
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Because of that they are envious between relatives

84
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If a Wayuu grazes a few goats, the rest get upset.

85
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That happens due to the lack of water, because the water
brought good life to all

86
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
for animals, people, children,
Because they all drink water

87
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Because it is from water that food is sown,
If there is no water, what will there be?

88
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
For example, this little bit of water that is here in the jaguey
When it runs out or dries up you won't see anything

89
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Even if I try to dig a hole under the jagüey with suffering,
So be it for a little water it would be in vain

90
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Meanwhile, he is thinking of a mill or a water well
that is miles from here

91
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Even if the Wayuu travels several kilometers to
get to the place even for a jug of water

92
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Why is it necessary for you to help people with water?

93
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It is necessary to ask for help from the earth and from you, the Arijunas.

94
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
because you work with water that comes from afar

95
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
They work so that water reaches the villages

96
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We are waiting for you to help us too

97
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
To ask that they bring us water here in the house from there

98
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Because if there is water, our traditions of
a healthy coexistence

99
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Return of abundance in food,
planting and sharing with others

100
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
People relate to each other
in the communities

101
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Why are we so envious?, for the
lack of water, it is something very necessary for us

102
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
For example, if water aid arrives in a neighboring community
give away a mill or a mini aqueduct

103
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Here they must also give the same, as well as in the others,
because that way we would all have water without any problem

104
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
With that help we can rebuild many things

105
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
what our ancestors did with plenty of rain.

106
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And another life expectancy?

107
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So why do we run to what is called town?

108
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Because we want the town hall to help us

109
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
They would help us with good things

110
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
like water, because water provides us with everything

111
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He is the one who gives food, animals

112
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The one who gives good friends too

113
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Everything we need we build with water

114
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Because we know how to use it since ancient times
Because we grew up in nature,

115
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and we know many things

116
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's why kids didn't get sick before

117
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's why there was no mistreatment between us

118
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
When there was water we helped each other

119
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We built a very large apain (orchard)
where we grow food

120
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We planted food in quantity such as beans

121
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Corn, sideburns, pumpkin among others.

122
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Our relatives, nephews and close people arrived
To help each other in the construction

123
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
that's where there was opportunity for life, where each one
I harvested a sack of beans

124
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He took it to exchange for other goods.

125
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So they gave him something for the exchange

126
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Our little children

127
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
They had the milk of our animals

128
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Like the goat, the sheep or the cow, if we have animals

129
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
They extract it to make cheese by pressing it

130
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It was also used to drink it and for children to drink it

131
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It was very good because it did not bring disease, all
We drank it until we were satisfied

132
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So they all worked in the garden

133
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Each one contributed to the construction and planting

134
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
If something happens, we all contribute
We always have something to pay

135
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Future conflicts may come, which may commit
our nephews, grandchildren or a member of the family

136
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Or the person who asks us for help, who lives with us
here in the community

137
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
in this way of living.

138
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Can you clarify that again?

139
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
He said that if they give us water he will not see disease

140
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
On earth everything would be alright

141
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
If the arijunas of the city help us

142
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
We'd love to hear about starving children.

143
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Children who say they die from malnutrition

144
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It is because of the bad life that there is and the lack of food

145
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
His mother does not have enough food to
produce milk for a baby

146
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
In addition to the lack of resources in the children's house

147
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
There are days when children go hungry and eat at the time they
find food

148
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
because food is scarce
That's why children get sick

149
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
For example, if they deliver the water that comes from the town

150
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You won't see children dying

151
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The earth will be composed as in ancient times

152
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That's why we need the water
Above all things.

153
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Done. Why do we have good material?

154
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
For example, this water that you are seeing
It is what we drink now

155
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Why do we drink it?, because we don't have any
Drinking water near here

156
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's why we use this water, we come looking for it
And we take it to our homes

157
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The town is too far from here to be able to go get water

158
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
In addition, a transport is needed to bring it from there and
we don't have that

159
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
When this water runs out we will suffer a lot

160
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
This is the water we're drinking while it lasts,
That's why we need you to help us

161
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
If the world sees us, they would help with the water we need
