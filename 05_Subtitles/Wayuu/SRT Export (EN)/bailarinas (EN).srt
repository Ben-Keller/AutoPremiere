Good morning,

32
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,916
My name is Katiuska Yamileth Jiménez Fajardo.

33
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:35,125
I'm here,

34
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:37,666
I'm here with this

35
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,750
learning to dance

36
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,458
Yonna, listen to this

37
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:47,166
and know everything

38
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:50,166
is heard belonging to

39
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:54,666
what is called

40
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,250
The Sauyeepia School

41
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,916
That.

42
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,250
Is.

43
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,000
Well , well. and for you

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,708
which? Well, what did we just see in the dance?

45
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,250
Can you explain to me ?

46
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,625
What what happened ? _

47
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,541
What were they doing in the dance, the steps

48
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,458
and the significance it has?

49
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:23,458
Well, our traditional dance,

50
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,666
Well, since long ago,

51
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:29,208
Since ancient times it has had some main variants.

52
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,291
which are called pachikuata and Pa'tawa , which

53
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,291
Well, it was what we danced at the beginning.

54
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,333
AHA

55
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,833
Our steps are closely related to nature,

56
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:46,833
in fact there we take like birds, for example, in

57
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,291
the one who is crouched

58
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:48,583
is called

59
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:52,458
Tortolita is one of the traditional birds typical of here

60
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,083
We also take into account traditional games.

61
00:02:56,166 --> 00:03:00,333
There is also, for example, the tro mpo , which is the one danced

62
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,291
going around and around , that one too. The one we dance

63
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:07,375
g represents the Samutkuaya (Zamuro)

64
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,916
in fact the one who is here,

65
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:12,250
the little black one, well that's the one we were imitating.

66
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,250
We imitate all the birds

67
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,625
in everything related to nature, the cloud, the wind.

68
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:19,750
That's more or less ours .

69
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,250
meanings .

70
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:32,291
Does anyone else want to talk ?

71
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:32,625
Well

72
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,625
And you, what is the connection you have when you are dancing?

73
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,125
Good with your spirituality

74
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,375
nature or with the boy too?

75
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,375
How do they feel ?

76
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,958
What is the experience like?

77
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,208
So

78
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:49,041
The most beautiful thing is that we enter a kind of

79
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,041
a harmonization.

80
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,833
Both in the Piyoi (dance space)

81
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:57,083
the ground, his elo, the circle and with the people around us.

82
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:01,208
But Yonna, more than anything, we do it for pleasure,

83
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,750
for pleasure, oneself,

84
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,625
because

85
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,208
As you can see, not all of us Wayuu do it .

86
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:13,166
I mean, lately we are losing it

87
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,625
thanks to the fact that they exist

88
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,125
centers

89
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,250
like the teacher's, like Saüyeepia , where , for.

90
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,500
Where

91
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,250
They strengthen and we try to

92
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,541
to give it,

93
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:32,916
make known and that other young people

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,750
strengthen.

95
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,500
that part.

96
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,625
Or also like

97
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:38,166
helps us,

98
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,125
as well as to also highlight

99
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,250
those values that we have here,

100
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,541
that for example that of harmony

101
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,625
be at these events and start with a

102
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:52,666
Yonna is like starting to liven up the meeting.

103
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:52,958
I mean,

104
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:53,791
That must be

105
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,041
the main thing,

106
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,291
It should not be left last, it should not be left in the middle . C on

107
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:01,416
That is what it begins , at the touch of the Kasha (drum) .

108
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:05,333
It's like someone who says the notice says now, the event is going to start.

109
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,166
Come here, get together, cheer up.

110
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,250
That's like the sign.

111
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:08,958
So just one

112
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,250
listen to sound,

113
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,125
Now the women get ready and say “I want to dance . ”

114
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:13,375
I mean,

115
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,416
It's not like they force you

116
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,125
But women say I want to dance ,

117
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:22,166
that you feel it, exactly like something that moves you.

118
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,250
And that too.

119
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,000
What is the role of women?

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,708
I see that the woman is going

121
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,375
controlling, exactly if

122
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,583
because it is not a competition but as a whole.

123
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,083
The man and the woman, but the woman there

124
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:38,958
It is the fundamental basis, because

125
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,791
the two, the two people, both the man and the woman,

126
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,708
Well, they are like giving,

127
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,458
showing his skill, showing his strength.

128
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,041
The man dances backwards,

129
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,583
He doesn't look even though we are going straight , I mean.

130
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,000
there is no advantage.

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Honestly, we're on the same level,

132
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,958
but the women there in that case are the ones that show the most

133
00:05:58,958 --> 00:05:59,416
the force

134
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,125
because the faster it goes

135
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,708
has the possibility of knocking him down,

136
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,166
thus showing worth and strength.

137
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,416
Sometimes yes

138
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,875
came at the moment of knocking down a man at the dance,

139
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,416
He says no, that girl is strong,

140
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,333
that family must be well prepared,

141
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,000
If you should have that woman,

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,208
then they start looking too.

143
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,208
The man If they see that it lasts a lot, as in the case of

144
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,458
Conraditus

145
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,416
He danced with all of us, then he danced again.

146
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,166
Then he says no,

147
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,125
that boy

148
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,333
He is strong, he already knows , he already has experience, he dances, he likes it,

149
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:32,708
So

150
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,791
are those little things that really

151
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,708
It makes everything wonderful.

152
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,958
And that has a relationship too.

153
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,750
to the Wayuu culture , bone

154
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,333
the role of women is something similar

155
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,708
to dancing, it's like that too.

156
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,833
Women are very important in our culture.

157
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:51,833
As I said at the beginning,

158
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,750
we are all who are

159
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,125
here, we are women trainers,

160
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,541
although we are not mothers, although we are not grandmothers or anything,

161
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:01,375
but for the simple fact of being in a family

162
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,791
be in our territory,

163
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,583
We are transmitting our knowledge to girls,

164
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,625
children. In these moments here

165
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,750
Well, we now reveal something of what we know

166
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,875
and that makes us a woman

167
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:12,708
Trained ra.

168
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:16,250
all the knowledge that a woman has is very sacred

169
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,083
and they are

170
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,791
spiritually as connected with

171
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,166
with everything that surrounds us.

172
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:25,166
In fact, dance also has a

173
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,750
a spiritual connotation, because when dancing

174
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,416
barefoot because we relate to our Mother

175
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,541
Earth (mma) then that helps us

176
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:34,875
also

177
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:38,750
how to connect with the dreams that we are going to have that day

178
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,166
to harmonize our territory

179
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:49,250
so that we have good dreams, good omens, as they say

180
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:54,208
How did you feel at the dance ?

181
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,333
Jaashaja jumala

182
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,208
talk girls

183
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,541
Well,

184
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,625
dance for me has a meaning,

185
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:08,750
because when we dance

186
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,666
we feel like dancing with

187
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,666
freedom, with joy,

188
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:18,583
with love, so because it is our culture,

189
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,958
we feel that we are free to express ourselves

190
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,750
in that way, dancing with our partner.

191
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,708
That's what we have done, we women

192
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:33,291
wayuu, dance, because Yoona has a lot of meaning,

193
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:37,166
because it is very, very used in various events

194
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:42,041
on several occasions, such as the departure of a Majayut (young woman) ,

195
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:46,041
like a confinement

196
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,250
and many things.

197
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,791
That's why we have Yonna

198
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,333
present at any time,

199
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,833
because it is something that represents us

200
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,833
to us Wayuu women and it is the Yonna

201
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yes, they also asked me that, when did he introduce himself to

202
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:06,166
the dance ? Here it is for this event, but traditionally when? .

203
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,416
By rituals , by rituals,

204
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,416
by dream, in hills

205
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,833
or the departure of a Majayut (newly young lady) .

206
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,208
And what is Majayut?

207
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,708
A, just, a just young lady

208
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,875
what, what was J imolü (girl)

209
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:26,083
When she develops, they lock her up and when she comes out

210
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,750
She is practically a young lady who is already forming

211
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:34,291
and then be a good person.

212
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,041
That is a ritual too , a ritual

213
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,041
what is done to the new ladies

214
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,791
and the Yonna is done

215
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,083
when it's going to come out, when it's going

216
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,500
make yourself known as a new woman,

217
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,500
because she is no longer a girl, she is going to be a woman, then

218
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:55,083
This ritual is performed and it is also accompanied by food,

219
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,458
drink, like a party, as they say,

220
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,333
but more than anything it is for that.

221
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,958
also been like a celebration

222
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,541
Yes, it's also like a celebration.

223
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:09,291
Yes, because when they dance they begin to say well,

224
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:13,750
look, a lady is going to come out, a woman and the men

225
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,833
they are always too

226
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:19,000
as if waiting to see who that new lady is

227
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,000
Who is that new lady?

228
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,416
And that ritual also works , it's good to dance the Yonna in the middle of that ritual

229
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,833
It's like driving away bad spirits,

230
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,000
As if to say we already danced, we already ate,

231
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,583
Those spirits are already happy

232
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:33,208
and they are full

233
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,708
They are going to leave this new lady alone

234
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,291
so that your process lives .

235
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,125
And they are made for that too.

236
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,750
If a dream does not ask you to do a dance at that time

237
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:47,041
such a lady must dance, put on this costume,

238
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,666
one does it to get away precisely

239
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,666
those bad spirits, diseases and so on.

240
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,791
And how long does this confinement last?

241
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,666
It's the lockdown

242
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:02,958
In itself , it lasts during the days of menstruation, but

243
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,583
After her menstruation she has to remain locked up

244
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,625
approximately a month and a half or two months.

245
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,625
It depends on the family,

246
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,375
It depends on your grandmother or the person or woman

247
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,708
who is accompanying her.

248
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,333
And where is the bull run ?

249
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,000
In a mud house

250
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
when the girl has her first menstruation

251
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:24,791
He tells his mother, months before they will have chosen

252
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,500
a woman who will be accompanying her ,

253
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,375
He will be instructing her, he will be guiding her,

254
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,583
saying and teaching the values, everything

255
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,958
related to knitting, for example.

256
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,500
Then she will be locked in a mud house

257
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,583
which is like that always.

258
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:43,125
It's always secluded, it's a new little house, in fact,

259
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,833
They prepare her, let's suppose, she is just a young lady,

260
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:47,541
not long ago

261
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,791
has already been developed

262
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,041
when she developed before she developed

263
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:54,041
Sorry, obviously between the family

264
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,041
We get together and say well, the girl is growing up,

265
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,708
Your new stage is already approaching,

266
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,750
So we have to prepare everything.

267
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,708
Then a new house is ordered to be built and it is bought

268
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,875
everything absolutely new because it is going to be a stage

269
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:12,750
And the old is given away

270
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,416
What if which one is it?

271
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,125
What are the

272
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:19,000
women's jobs or women's roles

273
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,375
on a day to day basis ? .

274
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:27,666
There are five fixed jobs as such, there is that of the Outsü

275
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,333
which is the, practically the pillar of the Wayuu territory

276
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:35,375
within our culture

277
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:35,958
is the

278
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,958
O ulaküt the visionary,

279
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,791
there is the woman E´inalü

280
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:46,416
What is she, the artisan ? there is the woman, the ceramist

281
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,875
and finally there is the woman

282
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:52,000
trainer that in this case well there are all of us included ,

283
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:55,375
Those are the five fundamental jobs

284
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,916
And within those five, the others are already released.

285
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,041
For example, dance comes from being a female trainer.

286
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,166
And they want to share something more

287
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,583
that I had not asked them.

288
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,541
I don't know what you want to ask

289
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,208
who want to know more.

290
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:19,291
From a woman's everyday day.

291
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,791
wayuu

292
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,125
What is an E´inalü woman like?

293
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,000
In that of an artisan , for example.

294
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,166
She can share with you because she is an artisan.

295
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,708
Well, like all roles

296
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:34,166
which like all roles, is also very important

297
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,166
harmonization at the moment

298
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,791
to knit because we knit

299
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,916
For pleasure, not all of us knit .

300
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:42,416
Suddenly,

301
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:46,916
At a time of confinement, they instill a lot of craftsmanship in us,

302
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,708
but it goes in one as a woman or as a lady.

303
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:55,666
well, I am a life-forming mother

304
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,125
and

305
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,375
I don't

306
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:02,625
pay attention to the fabric at the time of my development.

307
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,458
I liked it years later ,

308
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,375
already at 15 years old

309
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,416
I started knitting since

310
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:11,416
There I consider myself an artisan because I have been

311
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:15,750
1 0 years in this profession

312
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,541
when knitting,

313
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,875
let's say it the way it is explained

314
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:26,125
It's something nice because, because one enters into harmonization so much that if

315
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,750
we are going to give him a relationship,

316
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:35,250
We can give it like at the time of gestation of a baby because

317
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,500
just as the fetus grows inside our womb,

318
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,833
that is, it is the same, as it is done in the backpack

319
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,583
it is growing, little by little

320
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:47,625
They give him love and care

321
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,916
and we give

322
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:53,291
and we try to ensure that it does not have a deformity,

323
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,875
that I don't have,

324
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,166
that is, one wants it to be perfect ,

325
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:01,916
the same with the baby

326
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,916
and when it comes out it is

327
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,583
when comes

328
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:07,875
the feeling of

329
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:11,291
of gratitude, of satisfaction,

330
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,708
because already

331
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,666
It's something beautiful, something I can't explain

332
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,958
It is true and so are all

333
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:19,833
all roles

334
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:24,791
or all our roles are like that, everything has one , that is,

335
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:29,291
how you will feel very spiritual, something that, as they say, is very

336
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:33,083
Exactly, it's very difficult to explain

337
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,625
I mean one feels it.

338
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,333
And when you see, for example, an artisan,

339
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,916
Well, one already interprets everything

340
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,166
without needing her to explain to me

341
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,416
already knows that she is a mother

342
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:49,041
For this reason we do not explain with our mouths but with our hands.

343
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,500
And the designs, the dance.

344
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,250
Also the dance.

345
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,708
Just by starting to do

346
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:01,166
The different variants say “ah it's such a bird”

347
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,666
without needing to tell one

348
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,875
And that's what they have on their face

349
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,916
Can you explain to me what it is? why does he do it? that

350
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,416
What significance does it have ? What symbol ?

351
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,333
Well this is achepa (makeup) it is one of

352
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,833
Our traditional makeup

353
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,291
can be done in different ways

354
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:22,708
ways, it also has different uses

355
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,916
also depending on the occasion.

356
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:25,625
Right now,

357
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,291
how this is a meeting

358
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,708
and how we did the harmonization.

359
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,541
Well, we design.

360
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,166
This means the sun,

361
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:33,833
we draw the sun,

362
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,208
taking advantage of the fact that the sun is hot today,

363
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,458
So we capture all that, everything.

364
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,625
As I said, nature

365
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:43,000
It is in us, that is like our life too

366
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:43,750
I mean because

367
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,375
We left our Mother Earth, as we say,

368
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,250
so everything is connected with us.

369
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,791
So today we played the Sun

370
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,750
and it can, we can, even those who are in the kitchen.

371
00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:00,291
I don't know if we can see it today, because we cover our entire face.

372
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,875
with another who is paip ai

373
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,291
or it can be with mmeera , which are mushrooms.

374
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:04,750
For example.

375
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,791
This is a plant, it is called Pa li'ila

376
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,958
One has to wait for it to fall, for it to set

377
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:14,416
Red, she has her bone preparation, everything is a process,

378
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,750
and the one we have is already prepared,

379
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,875
It is simply starting to add water in this case,

380
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,958
but usually traditionally

381
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,916
It is with white sheep's bo

382
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,833
is with sebo .

383
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:28,833
He knew too

384
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:32,708
It is another process in which they prepare the tallow, strain it

385
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,166
it is white, white,

386
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,625
whitey is not just any sheep,

387
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,250
It doesn't have to be a small sheep either.

388
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:38,875
Newly

389
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,125
then they start preparing it

390
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,666
and then one has it stored there

391
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,625
and when we are going to use it, we apply the tallow

392
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,666
and then we apply the p aipai

393
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,791
Yes, yes it is for

394
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:52,375
as a blocker, if we are going to look for firewood, if we are going to cook

395
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,833
so that our faces don't burn ,

396
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:57,041
so that it doesn't get stained . In this case, since it is a ritual,

397
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,125
as we are in harmonization and it is a meeting

398
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,250
We say mi'ira, then we have

399
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:07,000
the agility to capture what we want

400
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,791
like makeup for different occasions,

401
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,208
Not then, for an event, a soft makeup

402
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,583
that for a recording it is already something better ,

403
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,833
It's almost like that

404
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,166
And that spiral too

405
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,791
It also has a meaning , because the dance is spiral, Yes.

406
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:27,666
Everything in our culture, everything being, everything

407
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,916
It is based on the spiral,

408
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:33,416
because in our life after dying,

409
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,333
We are going to Jeepira as we say,

410
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,291
already have like another life in the afterlife.

411
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,750
So it's not like suddenly by scale, like suddenly

412
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,291
in that of Westerners,

413
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,875
which is by stairs , until it reaches the last

414
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,875
Ours is a spiral because we don't know where it ends,

415
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:53,708
because one travels the path of life in a spiral

416
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:57,458
and come back again for the same

417
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:01,958
what is Jeepira

418
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,208
Can you explain me

419
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,166
What was the ritual he did?

420
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:10,916
with smoke and wood? and why did he do that?

421
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,375
AND

422
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,333
That is an incense, it is not witchcraft,

423
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:19,666
It is not witchcraft, it is our incense, as it is a harmonization

424
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,375
Well, we are pushing away the bad energies.

425
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:24,416
It's very good too

426
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,125
to ward off those diseases like the plague

427
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,416
In fact, I have it posted here too.

428
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,750
This is not wood, it is white bija,

429
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,416
It is a plant that

430
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,208
It is widely used for general ailments.

431
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,458
in fact during Covid

432
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,416
This is what helped us a lot,

433
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,583
a lot, as a territory

434
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,041
wayuu, was what we could say,

435
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,458
which saved the lives of many Wayuu .

436
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,500
So,

437
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,666
So what I did was

438
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:51,375
a kind of incense, because we make it akai'ja

439
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:52,916
to move away

440
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:56,625
those bad energies and make this meeting a good one

441
00:19:56,708 --> 00:20:00,291
fruitful and for also, since later

442
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,208
do not come

443
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,666
pests, taking into account that nowadays we see them ,

444
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,875
Virus variants ,

445
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,416
what is affecting many Wayuu children

446
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,416
That's why it helps us a lot.

447
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,333
And to start the dance too.

448
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:17,291
Exactly, to also just start the dance.

449
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,625
That is why some elderly

450
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:30,375
breathe freely.

451
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:35,000
Well, well, the video too,

452
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,583
That's how it can be explained.

453
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,958
Well we've seen a lot of red

454
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:42,375
and it has a meaning also in the culture for you is

455
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,833
women, for the wayuu

456
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:44,500
yes of course,

457
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,416
the Red color

458
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,625
It is one of our most representative colors.

459
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:53,625
It means for us purity, love, peace.

460
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:57,041
But it also means blood

461
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,625
It also has, it has like

462
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,541
one meaning

463
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,750
positive, so to speak,

464
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,041
but at the same time something like negative because the blood for us

465
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,375
It is very valuable, it is sacred .

466
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,708
In fact, if we suppose at this moment

467
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:16,750
there is a conflict and a person is affected

468
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,666
and his blood is spilled, because everyone says no, now

469
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,541
That is a problem,

470
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,333
Then we have to solve it because blood was shed ,

471
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,500
so the blood here in that

472
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,250
meaning of

473
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,000
which is very sacred,

474
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You don't play with it , even with the animal's blood.

475
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,541
if it is by ritual or if it is by dream.

476
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,458
There are times

477
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,958
in which it should be allowed to spill

478
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,958
and there are times or occasions in which it is consumed.

479
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:38,583
Does not consume it

480
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,958
Neither are men generally consumed either,

481
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,875
so

482
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,583
and like everything, also what we have

483
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:50,833
In our culture it is red , for example the achepa is red

484
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:51,416
it is already

485
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:54,708
one of our most representative birds , it is also red .

486
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,250
iisho

487
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,125
He is a cardinal, then

488
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,833
that is, basically red

489
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:04,208
It's like what we have the most there, that is, it's what we have the most

490
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:04,916
represents us

491
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:11,291
and it has that meaning related to everything. Also these blankets

492
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,250
It makes us feel like , if one wears red,

493
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,375
one feels at home, calm, it transmits to us

494
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,750
It is also or instead.

495
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,750
If one wears another color, for example yellow, I don't know,

496
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,791
one feels like one feels uncomfortable,

497
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,750
but red is what represents us the most.

498
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,750
It means a lot to us.

499
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,458
Add some of anything to it.

500
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:33,791
Come?

501
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:40,083
Do you want to say something else?

502
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,500
Yeah

503
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,208
Tell Kati how you felt in the Yonna , for example.

504
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:50,208
You who are new, how did you think of Yonna?

505
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:54,916
Or whatever you want to express

506
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,166
Well, she's my little sister.

507
00:22:57,166 --> 00:23:00,500
If that's why I scold her a lot,

508
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:05,500
She 's my little sister, so she's new at school.

509
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,916
So she's learning and she's learning

510
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:08,125
Then I'll

511
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,958
I'm saying share with us how you've been feeling,

512
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,416
did you like it?

513
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:16,291
So

514
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,916
when one dances in the Yoona,

515
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:23,250
When I dance, I feel happy,

516
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:28,208
one, I feel this, I feel that

517
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:30,833
I feel happy

518
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:35,083
to do what I want.

519
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:38,333
I want to learn, this I want,

520
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:43,291
I want to be one, I want to be like this as my partner See u

521
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:48,791
I want to learn to knit, to dance

522
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:52,375
also, make hammocks,

523
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:55,250
make backpacks,

524
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,750
this one

525
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,750
is to be a seedbed

526
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,833
and

527
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,833
make wayunkeera

528
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:08,291
be way unkeera what we do with mud

529
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,208
and what else.

530
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,583
And that seedbed ?

531
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,333
What is it? seedbed are the school children, the

532
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:17,125
smaller. So

533
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:20,666
Seedbeds comes from the word seed sa uyee .

534
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,000
So that's why we say seedbed , so yes.

535
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,208
and like her, like that

536
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:29,208
As we have many children at school.

537
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:33,125
So with the children, no, we don't take them like that.

538
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:35,125
She is my little sister, I have been at school for many years

539
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,625
and I don't take it like that,

540
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,958
but it is something that must be awakened in her.

541
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:41,625
Tell me no, I want to go

542
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:45,125
, I want to learn what everything is

543
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,000
d the want.

544
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,750
If I am forced to take it

545
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,125
here he was with his face,

546
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:51,458
but no, she enjoys it and enjoys it.

547
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:54,833
So much so, it looks fun and feels very good.

548
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:58,250
It was the first one you did

549
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:01,375
and how well I am, how well.

550
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,333
Well and for each of you

551
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:06,291
If I could carry a message to the whole world.

552
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:13,208
What message would it be?

553
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:19,458
You start. Can you think for a moment

554
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:22,958
I hope we don't let our culture lose.

555
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:26,750
If it is something so beautiful and so ours.

556
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:29,458
and it would be nice

557
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:30,750
that we value it more

558
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,500
and let's strengthen it

559
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,500
because as I tell you this has not been lost,

560
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,750
It's just that we have to strengthen it

561
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:43,666
but that is in one

562
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,208
Well

563
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:48,125
as the companion said.

564
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:51,416
As we are experiencing what the Yonna is

565
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,208
which is making wayunkeera (clay doll) or doing many things

566
00:25:55,291 --> 00:26:00,125
As you can do it too, you can practice.

567
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:02,416
Of course, it's not easy,

568
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:06,583
but if given time, they can learn to dance,

569
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:10,958
They can learn to be wayunkeera (clay doll)

570
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:13,250
to knit,

571
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,833
don't be ashamed of the culture

572
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:18,125
because it is beautiful.

573
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,083
Be wayuu

574
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:22,083
It is the most beautiful thing in this life

575
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:26,500
and learn many things from our ancestors that already

576
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:29,250
They are not here with us now, but there are

577
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:35,208
things that have left us

578
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:41,375
speaks

579
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:43,166
send a message to the children

580
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:49,291
I want to send the message to the boys and girls.

581
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:51,166
I want him not to be ashamed

582
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:56,458
of the Wayuu culture that

583
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:58,000
To learn

584
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,791
to do, to do the

585
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:13,750
Yonna, the Wayunkeera

586
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:14,833
I want them ,

587
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,833
May they learn just as I am learning now.

588
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:22,291
and nothing more

589
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:23,916
Well

590
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:25,541
to close

591
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:27,625
When they ask me a lot about messages

592
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:30,958
It inspired me a lot.

593
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:32,000
she was picking up, exactly,

594
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,208
I was trying not to repeat myself because if I don't know,

595
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:39,291
I have a lot of love for my culture.

596
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:42,416
For example, I have had many opportunities

597
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,958
to do other things instead of dancing suddenly

598
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:50,291
my traditional dance of dancing folklore different cities,

599
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,708
champeta, reggaeton .

600
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:54,000
They have called me for contests,

601
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,916
but seeing the cultural crisis

602
00:27:57,916 --> 00:28:00,708
that we are honestly going through,

603
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:02,791
Well, I feel like I can contribute my grain of sand.

604
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:05,666
from what I know how to do, from what I like,

605
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:08,500
which is dance, music.

606
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:09,083
Also my

607
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:12,041
know, learn, multiply what I know.

608
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,666
So my invitation is to love

609
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,166
what they have around them, regardless of whether they are Wayúu

610
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:24,250
or not. No, sometimes you can't imagine the spiritual connection

611
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,208
with nature

612
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:28,500
that has the different cultures here in our country,

613
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,166
and sometimes one gets careless.

614
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,625
For example, when we go to a city

615
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,416
we are very attentive to anything

616
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:36,916
because we don't know what meaning it has.

617
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,833
Then suddenly for those who come

618
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,250
from the outside, it would be very nice

619
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,208
Also, just as you who know,

620
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:43,708
who are interested in knowing

621
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:45,750
what does each thing mean ,

622
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,500
because that's how they also begin to respect it,

623
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,166
start taking care of her and they also start to love her.

624
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:51,666
And also

625
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:53,083
you who are not your own

626
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:55,083
Wayuu, you can contribute your grain of sand

627
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,958
To be able to make known what we are,

628
00:28:56,958 --> 00:29:00,791
to continue strengthening everything we have, maintain it

629
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:01,958
and keep it .

630
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:02,791
We at this time

631
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:03,250
what we want

632
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,000
is to preserve that for future generations.

633
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Then the invitation is also for you.

634
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:12,083
When he makes us known there, then let them remember us,

635
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:16,875
May they remember and they will always be welcome here.

636
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:21,166
May you also teach us

637
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:24,208
also.

638
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:28,000
And the last thing is if each of you can tell me

639
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:31,291
yes we have permission to use this in the documentary

640
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:34,208
our what are they doing

641
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:37,541
recording , and first before publishing anything

642
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:41,666
We passed by you to verify, but

643
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:42,750
as I am.

644
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:46,125
already authorize and so

645
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,750

Ok here.

this image so that everyone can recognize it .

653
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:09,625
She is a minor

654
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:13,166
So I'm going to authorize it for her, since she's my little sister.
