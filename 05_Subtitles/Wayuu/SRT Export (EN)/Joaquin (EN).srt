I'm a cultural manager,

I've been working on an educational process

00:01:16:17 --> 00:01:19:16
Well, I will

00:02:20:20 --> 00:02:22:01
Well, I spoke in my language, and now I will switch back.

42
00:02:22:01 --> 00:02:26:07
Let me repeat now so that you understand. I said that we are
I said that we are

43
00:02:26:07 --> 00:02:29:07
the guardians of the land,

44
00:02:30:04 --> 00:02:32:11
there was an ancient time,

45
00:02:32:11 --> 00:02:34:05
as the elders say.

46
00:02:34:05 --> 00:02:37:06
There was a beginning, an ancient time

47
00:02:37:06 --> 00:02:40:06
when our father Juya arrived,

48
00:02:40:13 --> 00:02:43:14
who is the rain, for us, he is rain and not just rain, because he is a man

49
00:02:44:21 --> 00:02:46:04
and the land is our

50
00:02:46:04 --> 00:02:49:14
ancient mother, he arrives,

51
00:02:50:18 --> 00:02:52:16
it rains, inseminating her, making love to her,

52
00:02:52:16 --> 00:02:57:23
and from our mother, plants are born, the first beings, then

53
00:02:59:03 --> 00:03:02:03
the animals, and third, the birds.

54
00:03:02:06 --> 00:03:05:13
And in the fourth generation, us,
the humans, the Wayúu people.

55
00:03:06:13 --> 00:03:09:13
But it was a woman.

56
00:03:11:16 --> 00:03:14:10
As the elders say, the land

57
00:03:14:10 --> 00:03:17:23
is very sacred to us.
It's our mother,

58
00:03:18:10 --> 00:03:23:00
and we should not sell it,
because we are not owners of the land,

59
00:03:23:00 --> 00:03:26:02
it owns us,
because we are born from it,

60
00:03:26:02 --> 00:03:29:02
and we return to it when we die.

61
00:03:29:20 --> 00:03:31:20
That's why it is very important

62
00:03:31:20 --> 00:03:34:08
to preserve the instruments and the music

63
00:03:34:08 --> 00:03:39:04
through thought, through the heart, and through the wind,
because my body

64
00:03:39:08 --> 00:03:42:08
is the one that creates music through thought and through the wind.

65
00:03:43:20 --> 00:03:46:07
And that's why our ancestors exist,

66
00:03:46:07 --> 00:03:49:19
the wind, the wind, Papa,

67
00:03:50:11 --> 00:03:54:11
our wind
that blows and forms whirlwinds

68
00:03:55:10 --> 00:03:58:10
born in nature, that teaches us how to make music.

69
00:03:59:10 --> 00:04:05:02
I'm going to play a tune, which I told you is called
"La Crianza en la Tierra Wayakana Shipi'jala tüü mmakat."

70
00:04:05:11 --> 00:04:07:22
We are the guardians of the land.

71
00:04:07:22 --> 00:04:09:06
And that's how it is.

72
00:04:09:06 --> 00:04:12:18
Just a moment before starting
to change the Atlantic configuration,

73
00:04:13:11 --> 00:04:16:11
set workers.

74
00:04:17:20 --> 00:04:21:13
From the State, Stars of Iberoamerica Context

75
00:04:25:11 --> 00:04:26:08
Ready.

76
00:04:26:08 --> 00:04:31:21
It's like that.

77
00:04:34:04 --> 00:04:41:12
Oh, oh oh oh.

78
00:04:42:18 --> 00:04:51:06
Oh, oh, oh

79
00:05:04:07 --> 00:05:06:22
Oh, oh, oh

80
00:05:06:22 --> 00:05:09:02
Well, this is another instrument

81
00:05:09:02 --> 00:05:12:02
also made by us, just as I told you before,

82
00:05:12:16 --> 00:05:15:09
it's called Maasi.

83
00:05:15:09 --> 00:05:18:04
We use this during herding,

84
00:05:18:04 --> 00:05:20:18
and to communicate with other companions.

85
00:05:20:18 --> 00:05:24:08
That's why I said it's better to do it in the community

86
00:05:24:08 --> 00:05:27:08
to have the spiritual connection.

87
00:05:28:07 --> 00:05:31:10
The wind helps us make the music,
so it also helps us communicate

88
00:05:31:23 --> 00:05:35:14
through the music,
so with it, I'll tell you a story,

89
00:05:36:23 --> 00:05:37:14
when we're herding,

90
00:05:37:14 --> 00:05:40:14
we communicate, each one has their rhythm,
their sound

91
00:05:41:05 --> 00:05:43:09
and distinctive sound.

92
00:05:43:09 --> 00:05:46:09
If I hear a sound, I say, "That's Pedro's,"

93
00:05:46:10 --> 00:05:50:08
if it's a different sound,
it's Juan's, and mine is also different.

94
00:05:50:19 --> 00:05:54:03
So, I communicate with Pedro through the music,

95
00:05:54:14 --> 00:05:59:11
it's like having a dialogue through playing,
asking if he has seen a lost sheep

96
00:05:59:22 --> 00:06:02:22
when I'm herding, and that's how it is.

97
00:06:56:12 --> 00:06:58:22
That sound is made by us,

98
00:06:58:22 --> 00:07:03:18
the music, the music, we create it from our minds,
we only need our ears,

99
00:07:04:16 --> 00:07:07:16
ears and thinking, thinking with nature.

100
00:07:08:14 --> 00:07:11:04
Plants, the air, they are the ones that help us

101
00:07:11:04 --> 00:07:14:04
make music, interpreting the sound.

102
00:07:14:10 --> 00:07:16:19
That's why it's important for us,

103
00:07:16:19 --> 00:07:21:02
these plants had a life,
this material comes from a plant, it returns to another life.

104
00:07:21:02 --> 00:07:23:02
Now, it's speaking and singing to us.

105
00:07:24:01 --> 00:07:26:11
It's still alive

106
00:07:26:11 --> 00:07:30:04
You know, they are born, they reproduce,
but as you say, "arijuna,"

107
00:07:30:04 --> 00:07:33:05
we say "arijuna" because they're not Wayuu. No,
it died for you, but

108
00:07:33:08 --> 00:07:36:06
for us, it's alive, it has another life,

109
00:07:36:06 --> 00:07:40:01
and it's speaking through my body,
through the wind I'm creating.

110
00:07:40:17 --> 00:07:42:05
It doesn't talk,

111
00:07:42:05 --> 00:07:45:05
and that's why the sound, it has a high and a low pitch.

112
00:07:45:15 --> 00:07:48:15
See, this is the high one,

113
00:07:55:15 --> 00:07:58:15
and this is the low one,

114
00:08:08:11 --> 00:08:11:11
this is the maasi, in our language.

115
00:08:11:11 --> 00:08:15:16
"Ontoroyoi" in our language has no name in Spanish.

116
00:08:16:00 --> 00:08:19:04
In truth, the elders say we made this out of necessity

117
00:08:19:04 --> 00:08:22:11
to maintain the harmony of the Wayuu people and to

118
00:08:23:02 --> 00:08:27:12
keep friendship among those of us who coexist.
And that's how music is for sadness,

119
00:08:27:12 --> 00:08:31:06
when we want to court a woman,
a female, we do it with this too.

120
00:08:32:14 --> 00:08:34:21
This one is called "sawawa,"

121
00:08:34:21 --> 00:08:36:16
we use this ourselves too,

122
00:08:36:16 --> 00:08:41:09
Young men use it to court women,
with a feeling when we are sad,

123
00:08:42:05 --> 00:08:46:19
when we are in love,
we make music with the help of nature too.

124
00:08:46:19 --> 00:08:49:08
When we hear the birds,

125
00:08:49:08 --> 00:08:51:09
we make music, the birds help us create

126
00:08:51:09 --> 00:08:54:09
the music, along with the wind and the sea.

127
00:08:54:15 --> 00:08:57:15
This is a song here of a Wayuu in love, and it goes like this,

128
00:09:29:13 --> 00:09:42:22
Oh, oh, oh.

129
00:09:45:15 --> 00:09:47:16
Well, that's the sawawa,

130
00:09:47:16 --> 00:09:50:16
as I told you, it's made by us,

131
00:09:52:11 --> 00:09:55:03
and these are materials from nature,

132
00:09:55:03 --> 00:09:58:03
these instruments have a ritual, these three,

133
00:09:59:06 --> 00:10:02:12
these instruments can only be played during the day and night,

134
00:10:02:12 --> 00:10:06:14
we can't play them at night, maybe when I travel to a city.

135
00:10:06:22 --> 00:10:12:13
But in our territory, I can't do it,
and if I play them at night, I have to ask for permission

136
00:10:12:13 --> 00:10:17:16
from Mother Earth and Father Rain,
because they have a ritual.

137
00:10:17:16 --> 00:10:21:22
They say that at that hour,
after six when the sun sets, they are already resting.

138
00:10:22:19 --> 00:10:28:00
We can't bother them in the morning so that
they wake up with that musical sound,

139
00:10:28:00 --> 00:10:31:23
to bring joy to our territory,
and only men play them.

140
00:10:32:14 --> 00:10:35:14
Sure, a woman can do it too,
but for us Wayuu, it's frowned upon.

141
00:10:36:00 --> 00:10:39:00
Maybe you can do it, a non-Wayuu woman can do it,

142
00:10:39:10 --> 00:10:42:14
but a Wayuu woman cannot,
because it's a fundamental craft of the men.

143
00:10:43:03 --> 00:10:46:05
At the moment of herding,
at the moment of searching for water at the Jagüey or the casimba,

144
00:10:47:15 --> 00:10:50:15
and at the moment when feeling something for a woman.

145
00:10:50:21 --> 00:10:55:22
That's why the instruments are very important, so they know
what Wayuu music is and what these instruments are used for.

146
00:10:55:23 --> 00:10:58:21
This one is called "ontoroyoi," sorry,

147
00:11:00:21 --> 00:11:04:09
turompa, this one is called "birimbao," they call it mouth harp,

148
00:11:04:18 --> 00:11:07:18
it's a well-known instrument among various indigenous groups,

149
00:11:07:22 --> 00:11:09:07
it was brought by colonizers.

150
00:11:09:07 --> 00:11:14:02
We adapted it
in a way that suits us and made it for ourselves,

151
00:11:14:04 --> 00:11:17:04
we manufacture it, women and men can play this one,

152
00:11:17:19 --> 00:11:20:19
as you can see, it's made of metal, very different from the plant.

153
00:11:23:23 --> 00:11:27:06
Plants have life, this one never had life,
and this one is made

154
00:11:27:06 --> 00:11:30:06
by humans and is riveted, whereas this one has

155
00:11:30:10 --> 00:11:33:10
a more spiritual character to make it,

156
00:11:33:15 --> 00:11:36:15
these ones made from plants,

157
00:11:37:03 --> 00:11:41:10
I'll play a tune for you, it's called the flutter of birds, at this time

158
00:11:41:10 --> 00:11:45:07
the birds are fluttering to rest,

159
00:11:45:07 --> 00:11:49:21
and they start doing it like this
and when it rains, they also start fluttering.

160
00:12:01:11 --> 00:12:18:19
Oh, oh, oh

161
00:12:23:03 --> 00:12:26:03
Oh, oh, oh.

162
00:12:29:02 --> 00:12:31:00
Oh, oh, oh

163
00:12:31:00 --> 00:12:36:11
You

164
00:12:37:05 --> 00:12:40:03
Are you blowing or just using your mouth?

165
00:12:40:03 --> 00:12:43:10
Not just the mouth, the mouth is for resonance, and I inhale

166
00:12:43:10 --> 00:12:46:10
and blow, but not very forcefully, softly.

167
00:12:46:23 --> 00:12:49:23
Yes, the mouth provides resonance, and

168
00:12:50:04 --> 00:12:53:06
I have to press my teeth together here
for it to produce the vibration

169
00:12:54:17 --> 00:12:56:18
from the reed in the center.

170
00:12:56:18 --> 00:12:57:21
That's interesting.

171
00:12:57:21 --> 00:13:00:21
They are alive, but you are alive too.

172
00:13:01:05 --> 00:13:02:20
Yes, I'm using this one, yes, correct.

173
00:13:02:20 --> 00:13:04:13
Yes, correct.

174
00:13:04:13 --> 00:13:08:22
So, for us, it's important to preserve the music. This is the tambora.

175
00:13:08:22 --> 00:13:13:17
Now, this is the kasha we use for dancing
at the yonna. We use

176
00:13:13:17 --> 00:13:18:18
the dance rhythms at the yonna. There's one called the horse race,

177
00:13:18:19 --> 00:13:19:18
That's why I wanted to play it, and

178
00:13:19:18 --> 00:13:24:04
I was inviting you all
because in the community, one can focus

179
00:13:24:04 --> 00:13:28:08
for longer periods,
because you hear noise here and noise there.

180
00:13:28:08 --> 00:13:34:11
So, it's not clear: in the community, nature helps us
to concentrate, and that way, things truly become

181
00:13:36:00 --> 00:13:39:00
evident, what we are, the music, and

182
00:13:39:17 --> 00:13:42:20
and maybe I'll bring another musician from the school because it's
different

183
00:13:42:20 --> 00:13:47:05
what he plays compared to what I do, it has a different sound,
it's the same instrument,

184
00:13:47:05 --> 00:13:51:04
the same tune, but it has another language.

185
00:13:52:01 --> 00:13:55:07
The sound is different, each one has their touch.

186
00:13:55:07 --> 00:13:58:07
It's like if he composes a song, it's
different from the one I compose,

187
00:13:58:21 --> 00:14:02:15
That's Wayuu music, we create it, and it's very important to us.

188
00:14:02:15 --> 00:14:05:15
As I said, the wind

189
00:14:05:21 --> 00:14:10:02
and the whirlwind, we call it "pichikua"
in our language, "pichikua" means whirlwind,

190
00:14:11:03 --> 00:14:13:20
and "jo'utai" means wind,

191
00:14:13:20 --> 00:14:18:06
because in our bodies,
we create music through the wind, thought, and heart,

192
00:14:18:17 --> 00:14:22:14
and what you think,
we turn into music with the help of the instrument.

193
00:14:23:02 --> 00:14:28:03
That's why it's very important to preserve Wayuu music
and for you to know about it.

194
00:14:28:23 --> 00:14:31:23
Taking the music to another level

195
00:14:32:11 --> 00:14:35:16
with other instruments that are not Wayuu,

196
00:14:35:17 --> 00:14:41:01
we are already doing it, the functions and trials,
and it has given us excellent results.

197
00:14:41:17 --> 00:14:44:08
Yes, maybe combining the music of

198
00:14:44:08 --> 00:14:49:22
reggaeton with the turompa,
the tambora with African calling drum,

199
00:14:50:16 --> 00:14:55:09
we are doing all this musical work
to preserve and maintain our cultural richness,

200
00:14:55:22 --> 00:15:00:16
without forgetting about ourselves,
our language, our spirituality,

201
00:15:01:22 --> 00:15:04:15
our territory,

202
00:15:04:15 --> 00:15:07:15
our clan, which is our social organization,

203
00:15:07:19 --> 00:15:10:08
and the traditional economy where you live.

204
00:15:10:08 --> 00:15:14:19
These five main pillars are very important,
which are our cultural expressions that are

205
00:15:14:19 --> 00:15:19:12
within the Wayuu normative system,
and our voices should always be in our
language, that's why I started

206
00:15:20:04 --> 00:15:24:12
speaking in my language, which is Wayunaiki,
that's why it's important,

207
00:15:24:17 --> 00:15:29:08
Wayunaiki means "people of good thinking,"
wayuu ana'a eki

208
00:15:30:05 --> 00:15:33:06
people of good thinking or good head.

209
00:15:34:01 --> 00:15:37:01
So, I invite you to join us, I don't know what you think,

210
00:15:38:06 --> 00:15:40:16
you can come with us tomorrow to that place,

211
00:15:40:16 --> 00:15:43:05
it's a very beautiful place,

212
00:15:43:05 --> 00:15:46:00
and I have to call and let them know that we are coming with you.

213
00:15:46:00 --> 00:15:49:01
So, yes, that's the plan, I don't know.

214
00:15:49:09 --> 00:15:51:05
If it works for you

215
00:15:51:05 --> 00:15:53:18
And about what you were talking to me at the beginning,
about the harmony or the harmony of the music

216
00:15:53:18 --> 00:15:58:05
Can you talk a little more about that,
about preserving harmony?

217
00:16:01:10 --> 00:16:04:18
There is already harmony in nature, and for me,

218
00:16:04:21 --> 00:16:09:02
it seems like the music is trying to reach that harmony, to be more connected.

219
00:16:18:10 --> 00:16:24:04
If we maintain music through spirituality,

220
00:16:24:04 --> 00:16:29:01
through spiritual connection, I can play the instrument here,
but it's not the same as playing it in my community.

221
00:16:29:01 --> 00:16:35:09
It's different there because I have a connection with nature,

222
00:16:35:14 --> 00:16:38:14
with the birds and animals,

223
00:16:38:14 --> 00:16:40:12
and the plants are what help me

224
00:16:40:12 --> 00:16:43:12
to maintain that energy

225
00:16:43:16 --> 00:16:45:15
and the body,

226
00:16:45:15 --> 00:16:48:08
because with my body, I think,

227
00:16:48:08 --> 00:16:51:08
because we are the fourth generation.

228
00:16:52:06 --> 00:16:55:13
we do the sound interpretation

229
00:16:56:18 --> 00:16:59:02
and not so much with our fingers

230
00:16:59:02 --> 00:17:02:15
but with what I think and what I see,
because one learns through observation.

231
00:17:03:11 --> 00:17:05:22
Yes, what I hear, I put my ear to it

232
00:17:05:22 --> 00:17:08:22
I hear the birds very well, I hear

233
00:17:09:11 --> 00:17:12:01
the waves of the sea, I hear the

234
00:17:13:01 --> 00:17:14:21
fluttering of the birds,

235
00:17:14:21 --> 00:17:18:21
I also hear the plants as they move. All of that

236
00:17:19:08 --> 00:17:22:08
is what teaches us how to make music together,

237
00:17:22:19 --> 00:17:25:18
with that we make our music and also

238
00:17:26:23 --> 00:17:28:18
the animals like the birds.

239
00:17:28:18 --> 00:17:31:18
That's why I played a little bit of the fluttering of the birds.

240
00:17:32:12 --> 00:17:35:12
It's all through nature,

241
00:17:35:23 --> 00:17:38:23
that's why music is very important to us

242
00:17:40:01 --> 00:17:44:04
and within our community,
because it helps us create harmony

243
00:17:44:23 --> 00:17:49:11
and spiritual connotation,
because there is spiritual music like the tambora,

244
00:17:49:11 --> 00:17:53:02
there is healing music that helps heal the sick

245
00:17:53:20 --> 00:17:56:17
and helps ward off negative energies.

246
00:17:56:17 --> 00:17:59:17
During the time of COVID

247
00:18:00:00 --> 00:18:03:21
there was a dream from women, spiritual authorities
of the Wayuu people

248
00:18:04:10 --> 00:18:07:15
because there is a spiritual authority of women.

249
00:18:08:15 --> 00:18:11:15
There was a dream she had where a yonna dance had to be performed,
which is a dance,

250
00:18:11:22 --> 00:18:16:08
that's why I said it was better to explain
there how it was and that the tambora had to be played, which is the kasha.

251
00:18:16:22 --> 00:18:19:08
in order for that COVID energy to go away

252
00:18:19:08 --> 00:18:22:22
and he said we should place a plant called malu'a

253
00:18:23:20 --> 00:18:26:20
which has good energy and

254
00:18:27:06 --> 00:18:29:02
that way, the energy of COVID

255
00:18:29:02 --> 00:18:32:14
wouldn't reach our territory
and indeed it didn't affect us much, only impacted

256
00:18:32:14 --> 00:18:36:13
the city and urban areas, and that helped us a lot

257
00:18:36:13 --> 00:18:38:15
to preserve through music.

258
00:18:38:15 --> 00:18:42:04
It helped us defend ourselves from illnesses, bad energies

259
00:18:42:22 --> 00:18:45:22
and to preserve what one desires and feels.

260
00:18:47:04 --> 00:18:50:04
Yes, it has power

261
00:18:50:05 --> 00:18:52:13
I have taken it to the Philharmonic Orchestra of Bogota,

262
00:18:53:15 --> 00:18:55:01
yes, there we are preparing for a performance,

263
00:18:55:01 --> 00:18:58:14
we are testing with other instruments,
like the violin,

264
00:18:58:22 --> 00:19:01:22
like those big drums, we are conducting all the tests

265
00:19:02:04 --> 00:19:05:04
to present it in a sonorous way

266
00:19:05:09 --> 00:19:07:04
that can be showcased to the world.

267
00:19:07:04 --> 00:19:11:02
In the Wayuu village,
we also have an instrument.

268
00:19:11:19 --> 00:19:12:18
Even though it's small,

269
00:19:12:18 --> 00:19:16:12
this instrument, called sonoros, holds a special
meaning for us,

270
00:19:16:23 --> 00:19:20:22
it's very, very spiritual for us,
very important for the Wayuu people

271
00:19:21:12 --> 00:19:24:22
and that's why we preserve it through the school
we have here,

272
00:19:26:04 --> 00:19:29:04
teaching the boys and girls

273
00:19:29:22 --> 00:19:33:12
about Wayuu music, why we do it and how we do it,

274
00:19:34:01 --> 00:19:37:01
and why it's important to maintain Wayuu music.

275
00:19:38:01 --> 00:19:40:18
And can you tell me a bit about that?

276
00:19:40:18 --> 00:19:44:14
More about the school and what we are going to do tomorrow?

277
00:19:44:14 --> 00:19:49:03
Well, you see the image there,
that's Maestro Jorge Enrique,

278
00:19:49:16 --> 00:19:53:10
a Wayuu music teacher who taught me, he passed away.

279
00:19:54:00 --> 00:19:57:17
He's resting in Jepira because when we die, we don't

280
00:19:57:17 --> 00:20:02:00
go to heaven
nor to the right hand of God, we embark on a long journey

281
00:20:03:02 --> 00:20:04:05
to the paradise of the dead, which

282
00:20:04:05 --> 00:20:07:07
is where you go to the Cabo de la Vela, and our soul rests there

283
00:20:07:07 --> 00:20:10:07
We embark on a long journey

284
00:20:10:21 --> 00:20:14:06
and through everything we feel and do.

285
00:20:14:07 --> 00:20:17:16
The elders say

286
00:20:17:16 --> 00:20:20:15
that we become water,

287
00:20:20:20 --> 00:20:24:20
we fall into the sea there in Cabo or Jepira, and then

288
00:20:24:20 --> 00:20:28:08
it evaporates, rises to the sky, and falls back to the earth

289
00:20:28:14 --> 00:20:31:10
to fertilize the land and

290
00:20:31:10 --> 00:20:35:13
We return to another life,
the plants are the same.

291
00:20:36:05 --> 00:20:39:10
In the Wayuu village, we don't pollute the plants,

292
00:20:40:04 --> 00:20:43:04
we don't harm nature,

293
00:20:43:14 --> 00:20:47:11
but there have been many people
who have come to pollute our territory

294
00:20:48:00 --> 00:20:51:22
and some Wayuu people have also learned to do that, and that has also lost

295
00:20:51:22 --> 00:20:56:07
the way of preserving, taking care of the instruments because there are plants that are no longer there

296
00:20:57:00 --> 00:21:01:07
in some parts, so we have to look for them
in other territories

297
00:21:02:01 --> 00:21:06:08
because in our culture, there is a space that is only
reserved for the plants, and that cannot be disturbed.

298
00:21:06:18 --> 00:21:09:08
It's as if it were our heart, it's the Wayuu,

299
00:21:09:08 --> 00:21:12:20
that's where we plant,
we maintain all the crops so we can eat

300
00:21:13:12 --> 00:21:16:19
because everywhere else
we can't plant, only in that specific area,

301
00:21:16:19 --> 00:21:20:02
which the Wayuu identifies through the heart,
and there are the plants

302
00:21:20:02 --> 00:21:23:17
and the musical instruments where we can make
each instrument to play

303
00:21:25:00 --> 00:21:28:06
the sawawa, the maasi, and the ontoroyoi.

304
00:21:28:23 --> 00:21:30:13
Through that.

305
00:21:30:13 --> 00:21:32:22
Do you choose a plant yourself?

306
00:21:32:22 --> 00:21:36:05
Yes, we make it ourselves,
I personally make it, I search for the plant,

307
00:21:36:16 --> 00:21:38:11
they have their time, the moment when I can cut them,

308
00:21:38:11 --> 00:21:40:15
I can't cut them anytime,

309
00:21:40:15 --> 00:21:43:03
they have their moon time

310
00:21:43:03 --> 00:21:46:09
and I can't cut them. We

311
00:21:46:10 --> 00:21:49:16
ask permission from Mother Earth through rituals

312
00:21:50:09 --> 00:21:53:23
to be able to cut the plants. I can't just

313
00:21:53:23 --> 00:21:58:05
cut them at any time, no, they have their time.

314
00:22:01:01 --> 00:22:04:01
And is there

315
00:22:04:07 --> 00:22:07:07
a connection between dance and music?

316
00:22:07:22 --> 00:22:11:01
I mean, I've seen that the drums don't.

317
00:22:11:20 --> 00:22:12:15
Yes, the dance of the yonna

318
00:22:12:15 --> 00:22:15:23
is done with the Kasha, which for us is a drum

319
00:22:17:05 --> 00:22:20:00
and during the dance

320
00:22:20:00 --> 00:22:23:05
There's a ritual we perform before the dance

321
00:22:24:09 --> 00:22:27:09
in a sacred space called piyoi, which is a circle.

322
00:22:27:13 --> 00:22:30:08
A circle where the girls dance barefoot,

323
00:22:30:08 --> 00:22:33:02
sometimes, these days, as the sun has been very hot,

324
00:22:33:02 --> 00:22:38:08
they've had to dance in a space wearing sandals,
but it's always barefoot.

325
00:22:39:09 --> 00:22:43:13
They wear their red patterned shawl, symbolizing
what red represents,

326
00:22:43:18 --> 00:22:47:11
our blood, the land,
especially what relates to spirituality.

327
00:22:48:23 --> 00:22:50:11
And there are different dances,

328
00:22:50:11 --> 00:22:55:03
what do they show there? The steps, like those of the alcaraván,
they do the step of the tortolita,

329
00:22:55:03 --> 00:22:59:12
the dove, the vulture,
everything that exists in nature,

330
00:23:00:02 --> 00:23:03:02
showing all the richness we see in our territory,

331
00:23:03:09 --> 00:23:06:03
that's what they portray through the dance. The Yonna dance

332
00:23:06:03 --> 00:23:10:09
is a challenge between the man and the woman, in the strength they measure.

333
00:23:10:15 --> 00:23:14:10
That's why the man goes backward
and the woman goes forward always.

334
00:23:15:00 --> 00:23:17:23
And there, the woman's skill is more evident than the man's.

335
00:23:18:08 --> 00:23:19:16
That's why it's important for the woman in the

336
00:23:20:18 --> 00:23:23:18
dance to wear her veil (kiara) beautifully,

337
00:23:24:01 --> 00:23:27:01
her face adorned with palisha (red powder)

338
00:23:27:02 --> 00:23:29:21
and her hair elegantly styled.

339
00:23:29:21 --> 00:23:32:21
That's what adds beauty to the yonna dance.

340
00:23:39:12 --> 00:23:42:12
Yes, that's very good

341
00:23:43:19 --> 00:23:47:19
It could also be possible to play a little more.

342
00:23:48:22 --> 00:23:51:07
Well, yes,

343
00:23:51:07 --> 00:23:53:14
Well, let's play a bit here

344
00:23:53:14 --> 00:23:55:21
On the drum too,

345
00:23:55:21 --> 00:23:59:04
but I can stand up because I have to stand up

346
00:24:03:06 --> 00:24:05:20
Alright, I'll put

347
00:24:05:20 --> 00:24:08:20
this inside the pocket if you want.

348
00:24:27:03 --> 00:24:28:21
Right there.

349
00:24:28:21 --> 00:24:31:21
Yes. No, no!

350
00:24:32:14 --> 00:24:33:17
Well, the rhythm that

351
00:24:33:17 --> 00:24:36:06
I'm going to play is a rhythm

352
00:24:36:06 --> 00:24:38:12
of yonna.

353
00:24:38:12 --> 00:24:41:12
It's the traditional dance

354
00:25:51:16 --> 00:25:53:08
of the Yonna.

355
00:25:53:08 --> 00:25:53:14
I'm going to play

356
00:25:53:14 --> 00:25:56:14
a rhythm of the horse race.

357
00:26:28:12 --> 00:26:30:04
Well, those are the rhythms

358
00:26:30:04 --> 00:26:34:04
that we play with the kasha
and well, with the Yonna dance, we play more.

359
00:26:44:02 --> 00:26:44:15
Well.

360
00:26:44:15 --> 00:26:47:11
What else could it be?

361
00:26:47:11 --> 00:26:52:03
We'd be happy to listen.

362
00:26:52:19 --> 00:26:55:11
You can play the song if you want,

363
00:26:55:11 --> 00:26:57:17
the one you said you were going to play, another one.

364
00:26:57:17 --> 00:27:00:15
No, no, if you want, I can play another instrument.

365
00:27:00:15 --> 00:27:03:15
Let's continue, that was the sound of the turompa, and

366
00:27:03:23 --> 00:27:05:08
Well,

367
00:27:05:08 --> 00:27:08:08
I'm going to play the turompa with a sound

368
00:27:08:12 --> 00:27:11:12
called the jumping dog

369
00:27:11:19 --> 00:27:14:19
or the jayariyu dog

370
00:27:14:22 --> 00:27:17:17
it's called the jayariyu dog, meaning from my clan

371
00:27:17:17 --> 00:27:20:17
We identify ourselves with eirüku.

372
00:27:21:19 --> 00:27:25:17
Well, you Arijunas call it a clan,
but it's not a clan, it's the eiruku

373
00:27:25:21 --> 00:27:28:21
which is my

374
00:27:29:12 --> 00:27:34:01
mother, who are part of the interclanial,
they are a family to us

375
00:27:34:01 --> 00:27:38:01
we don't have any interclanial part,

376
00:27:38:02 --> 00:27:41:02
at least my children are not my children,

377
00:27:41:03 --> 00:27:43:13
my children are the children of my sisters,

378
00:27:43:13 --> 00:27:46:09
and the children of their daughters are my children

379
00:27:47:08 --> 00:27:50:18
because they belong to my clan, my eirüku

380
00:27:51:16 --> 00:27:54:20
and we play a tune from the eirüku like this.

381
00:27:59:02 --> 00:28:02:02
Oh, oh, oh

382
00:28:02:16 --> 00:28:06:13
Oh, oh, oh

383
00:28:07:20 --> 00:28:10:17
un muy

384
00:28:10:17 --> 00:28:13:17
Oh, oh, oh

385
00:28:18:09 --> 00:28:33:14
Oh, oh, oh

386
00:28:41:21 --> 00:28:42:13
Well, that's a rhythm

387
00:28:42:13 --> 00:28:45:22
that I have always played,
and with music, melodies as well,

388
00:28:45:22 --> 00:28:49:14
I play it with fusion music with other non-Wayuu instruments.

389
00:28:50:18 --> 00:28:52:21
I'm going to play a rhythm,

390
00:28:52:21 --> 00:28:55:21
about what one feels, what one thinks,

391
00:28:56:12 --> 00:28:59:08
what

392
00:28:59:08 --> 00:29:01:23
is called, it's called the sounds of the earth.

393
00:29:01:23 --> 00:29:06:01
Yes, when you feel the earth, you feel the wind, a noise,

394
00:29:06:20 --> 00:29:09:20
and it's in this way like this.

395
00:30:06:19 --> 00:30:09:19
How do you learn your songs?

396
00:30:09:21 --> 00:30:14:06
Do you create some yourself,
but do others pass down through generations?

397
00:30:14:13 --> 00:30:18:17
No, no, no, the music comes from oneself,
sometimes we imitate others

398
00:30:18:17 --> 00:30:23:16
another rhythm from a fellow musician,
but most of it comes from our own inspiration

399
00:30:24:07 --> 00:30:27:18
in the moment one thinks and feels
and what one sees

400
00:30:27:18 --> 00:30:32:08
as I just mentioned, in nature,
these are the things that teach us

401
00:30:32:08 --> 00:30:35:23
The teachers are the plants, animals, and birds

402
00:30:35:23 --> 00:30:37:07
The wind makes the music.

403
00:30:38:17 --> 00:30:41:21
Well,
I think we are going to play the casimba rhythm here.

404
00:30:41:21 --> 00:30:48:16
When you draw water from the well,
it produces sounds that are sounds of lament.

405
00:30:48:17 --> 00:30:51:17
And it goes like this.

406
00:31:09:10 --> 00:31:13:18
Oh oh, oh

407
00:31:22:11 --> 00:31:25:11
oh. Oh

408
00:31:26:02 --> 00:31:27:11
Those are the sounds.

409
00:31:27:11 --> 00:31:29:23
What is that thing down there?

410
00:31:29:23 --> 00:31:32:07
This is a calabash, called "aliita"

411
00:31:32:07 --> 00:31:35:07
in Wayunaiki, it's a gourd that we have
This is "mokochira" (plant).

412
00:31:36:06 --> 00:31:38:09
Yes, we always put this on it, sometimes

413
00:31:38:09 --> 00:31:41:09
as an ornament to hold it.

414
00:31:41:09 --> 00:31:43:01
And it can be disassembled like this

415
00:31:43:01 --> 00:31:46:01
so we can store it

416
00:31:47:03 --> 00:31:50:16
It can be taken apart and assembled like clarinets.

417
00:31:50:16 --> 00:31:53:13
Right?

418
00:31:53:13 --> 00:31:57:04
They call them the same way.

419
00:31:57:14 --> 00:31:58:08
And that's it.

420
00:31:58:08 --> 00:31:59:23
In which

421
00:31:59:23 --> 00:32:00:19
environments?

422
00:32:00:19 --> 00:32:02:19
Usually, the music is played

423
00:32:02:19 --> 00:32:04:08
I mean, during the day.

424
00:32:04:08 --> 00:32:07:02
Well, I was saying some are for the night.

425
00:32:07:02 --> 00:32:09:02
Yes, some of them have specific rituals.

426
00:32:09:02 --> 00:32:11:21
This instrument is only for daytime,

427
00:32:12:22 --> 00:32:13:10
it cannot be played

428
00:32:13:10 --> 00:32:16:13
at night because, according to the elders,
if we do so at night, it calls

429
00:32:16:13 --> 00:32:20:18
bad energies, because at that time they are resting,

430
00:32:21:16 --> 00:32:24:16
they rest to think,

431
00:32:24:21 --> 00:32:28:08
to prepare for the next day and speak, speaking well,

432
00:32:30:04 --> 00:32:31:21
the horn normally, yes.

433
00:32:31:21 --> 00:32:34:21
The "kasha" can also be played at any time,

434
00:32:35:13 --> 00:32:37:20
because "kasha" is sometimes used for food gatherings.

435
00:32:37:20 --> 00:32:39:05
They say the "tambora" too.

436
00:32:39:05 --> 00:32:44:21
We copied the drums that the Spaniards brought
to our territory with snare drums.

437
00:32:44:21 --> 00:32:48:07
We observed them and, because of the need the Wayuu people had

438
00:32:49:09 --> 00:32:52:09
to create something harmonious to maintain the sound,
to keep the dance.

439
00:32:52:23 --> 00:32:55:16
And that's how the "kasha" was created, but using our own materials,

440
00:32:55:16 --> 00:33:00:02
like the plant: this is a plant, and these are animal skins.

441
00:33:00:15 --> 00:33:03:20
Here, we have the generational aspect that is part of
our cosmovision.

442
00:33:04:12 --> 00:33:07:14
of the generational aspect while playing exactly.

443
00:33:07:23 --> 00:33:11:00
And this, well, it's a material that has no life,

444
00:33:11:21 --> 00:33:15:20
it's metallic, brought by the colonizers,

445
00:33:16:10 --> 00:33:18:23
and then we make music with it.

446
00:33:20:02 --> 00:33:22:07
And what about the red thing?

447
00:33:22:07 --> 00:33:26:21
We use this as an ornament to maintain the
energy and harmony.

448
00:33:27:07 --> 00:33:30:01
to identify ourselves because this one is mine.

449
00:33:30:01 --> 00:33:33:02
I identify myself with this color
and the colors and the tassel,

450
00:33:33:17 --> 00:33:36:17
so we use it as an ornament to keep it that way.

451
00:33:37:22 --> 00:33:41:01
And what's that thing there?

452
00:33:41:10 --> 00:33:44:15
This is a "Koushut," that's what it's called,

453
00:33:45:02 --> 00:33:49:16
but today we make it as the maestro Enrique has it,
with a feather, it's called "karatsü,"

454
00:33:49:16 --> 00:33:55:05
and it's used for dancing the "yonna," as part of the presentation,
but it's used more to identify us

455
00:33:55:16 --> 00:33:58:23
if one is a good musician,
a good craftsman.

456
00:33:59:11 --> 00:34:01:23
Yes, in the past, it was used to identify during wars,

457
00:34:01:23 --> 00:34:06:01
when there were interclan or Spanish wars,
they would wear it.

458
00:34:07:02 --> 00:34:10:09
There's one called "tu'upana,"
and this one is called "koushut."

459
00:34:10:10 --> 00:34:14:15
They wore them to identify themselves
amongst each other, to show who was the leader

460
00:34:14:17 --> 00:34:19:18
So it's a symbol of leadership within the interclan group.

461
00:34:20:15 --> 00:34:23:00
If I wear it, I identify myself a lot,

462
00:34:23:00 --> 00:34:26:00
and people recognize me with this a lot.

463
00:34:26:02 --> 00:34:29:04
wherever I go, I have ones in different colors,

464
00:34:29:17 --> 00:34:33:01
depending on the outfit I wear, the guayabera,

465
00:34:33:01 --> 00:34:36:23
or if I wear my traditional clothing, perhaps

466
00:34:37:00 --> 00:34:40:00
if you come tomorrow, you'll see me dressed in it.

467
00:34:43:02 --> 00:34:46:02
How important do you consider music?

468
00:34:46:06 --> 00:34:49:01
Is it like everyone in the community ends up

469
00:34:49:01 --> 00:34:53:02
being a musician in some way,
the children, the adults?

470
00:34:54:04 --> 00:34:57:04
How does music affect you?
How does it change you?

471
00:34:58:11 --> 00:35:02:13
Music comes as a legacy,
a legacy of the family.

472
00:35:02:22 --> 00:35:07:03
Not all Wayuu are musicians, it's a legacy.

473
00:35:07:17 --> 00:35:11:05
And if we teach the children all the instruments, maybe they'll learn one

474
00:35:11:14 --> 00:35:12:13
the one they like, maybe

475
00:35:12:13 --> 00:35:15:19
this one or any other, but not all of them will learn.

476
00:35:15:20 --> 00:35:19:09
If I have 40 children, all 40
won't learn to play all the instruments.

477
00:35:20:09 --> 00:35:22:16
Maybe one or two will become good at playing

478
00:35:22:16 --> 00:35:25:16
the maasi or the sawawa, but

479
00:35:25:18 --> 00:35:29:00
over time they grow to like it and they learn it

480
00:35:29:00 --> 00:35:30:16
on their own,

481
00:35:30:16 --> 00:35:35:10
by listening and observing. We learn
through observation and listening,

482
00:35:36:07 --> 00:35:39:20
we don't write, we don't record,

483
00:35:39:20 --> 00:35:43:02
it's all by ear, just listening and observing.

484
00:35:43:22 --> 00:35:44:19
That's how we learn.

485
00:35:44:19 --> 00:35:47:20
And that's the legacy we have in school,
the legacy left by my uncle.

486
00:35:48:04 --> 00:35:51:15
Master Jorge Enrique, who is there in the picture,
the legacy of our grandparents,

487
00:35:52:07 --> 00:35:54:16
that's the legacy they give us, and they are concerned

488
00:35:54:16 --> 00:35:58:00
because they say that those of us who are left,

489
00:35:58:11 --> 00:36:02:10
because they have already gone to rest in jepira,
we have to preserve and conserve

490
00:36:03:01 --> 00:36:07:18
the music through this,
what we do as a school, we call it

491
00:36:08:15 --> 00:36:11:14
Ekiraja in our language, but

492
00:36:11:14 --> 00:36:14:19
in your art as arijuna (non-Wayuu),

493
00:36:15:08 --> 00:36:18:05
we call it school, as you can see the looms as well,

494
00:36:18:05 --> 00:36:21:21
the women make their weavings
which we need to wear the siira (traditional dress).

495
00:36:22:23 --> 00:36:23:15
Everything has a legacy

496
00:36:23:15 --> 00:36:27:19
and a spiritual connotation,
because that's what women allow us to do,

497
00:36:27:19 --> 00:36:30:21
If we don't make the music, if we don't have women

498
00:36:30:21 --> 00:36:33:21
to make these things for us, we can't make the music

499
00:36:34:06 --> 00:36:36:02
because with them, we also

500
00:36:36:02 --> 00:36:39:02
think and feel to sing
and make music for them.

501
00:36:41:07 --> 00:36:44:04
And songs? Are there songs about love too?

502
00:36:44:04 --> 00:36:47:01
Yes, yes, there are songs, Jayechi,

503
00:36:47:01 --> 00:36:50:03
but I don't sing Jayechi because it's a spiritual song.

504
00:36:50:17 --> 00:36:57:06
Yes, that's it, everyone has their own theme,

505
00:36:57:06 --> 00:37:01:15
and those songs are mostly sung by people who are experienced

506
00:37:02:10 --> 00:37:05:10
if there's a spiritual healing song,
it's sung by a woman Outsü,

507
00:37:05:12 --> 00:37:08:09
who is the spiritual authority, sung by women singers, and

508
00:37:09:10 --> 00:37:10:20
and men also sing it

509
00:37:10:20 --> 00:37:14:03
during parties
when they are drinking, when there's chirrinchi (Wayuu alcoholic beverage)
they start singing Jayechi

510
00:37:14:16 --> 00:37:17:16
and they are anecdotes that tell their history

511
00:37:18:07 --> 00:37:20:03
in their language.

512
00:37:20:03 --> 00:37:22:12
And are there songs

513
00:37:22:12 --> 00:37:26:21
that are not their own,
but have been passed down? I mean, songs

514
00:37:26:21 --> 00:37:30:23
that everyone knows or that musicians know someone created

515
00:37:30:23 --> 00:37:35:02
and have been interpreted again

516
00:37:36:04 --> 00:37:39:04
No, if you hear

517
00:37:39:04 --> 00:37:42:22
a Wayuu singing a non-Wayuu song, he might sing a ranchera.

518
00:37:43:18 --> 00:37:44:03
Why?

519
00:37:44:03 --> 00:37:48:20
Because on the coast,
the first people who arrived in our territory

520
00:37:49:06 --> 00:37:52:06
were Mexicans.

521
00:37:52:06 --> 00:37:53:08
That's what our elders tell us.

522
00:37:53:08 --> 00:37:57:12
That's why we use the tin cups where
you drank from

523
00:37:58:13 --> 00:38:00:11
are from Mexico.

524
00:38:00:11 --> 00:38:04:13
Those tin cups are not from us: they came since the conquest.

525
00:38:05:22 --> 00:38:09:02
So if you ask an elderly Wayuu man to sing you a song,

526
00:38:09:02 --> 00:38:10:07
he might sing a ranchera.

527
00:38:10:07 --> 00:38:14:15
Why? Because it's a legacy that comes from
years ago,

528
00:38:15:02 --> 00:38:19:07
our elders say that within our music,
the first music that arrived,

529
00:38:19:19 --> 00:38:21:23
which is not ours, was rancheras.

530
00:38:21:23 --> 00:38:24:23
Not even vallenato, because vallenato was created here.

531
00:38:25:03 --> 00:38:27:13
The accordion vallenato was created here

532
00:38:27:13 --> 00:38:30:17
it was created in La Guajira and spread to the south

533
00:38:31:08 --> 00:38:34:20
It reached Valledupar
and in Valledupar, vallenato music was created

534
00:38:34:20 --> 00:38:37:20
because it was originally played with a guitar, and then the accordion was introduced

535
00:38:38:01 --> 00:38:41:01
because it is a music, practically

536
00:38:41:12 --> 00:38:44:14
we can say it's indigenous
because the tambora drum

537
00:38:45:00 --> 00:38:48:01
comes from Africa, from the African or Afro people

538
00:38:49:14 --> 00:38:52:14
and the guacharaca is also indigenous
because it comes from the Sierra Nevada.

539
00:38:53:05 --> 00:38:55:10
Really? Well, it's interesting that here on the peninsula

540
00:38:55:10 --> 00:38:59:05
a lot has been influenced by the Wayuu, from what I've read and heard.

541
00:39:00:23 --> 00:39:03:09
Well, there have been exchanges

542
00:39:03:09 --> 00:39:06:09
between different cultural elements

543
00:39:06:09 --> 00:39:10:02
from all around the Caribbean, Mexico, North America.

544
00:39:10:11 --> 00:39:13:14
Yes, of course.

545
00:39:13:19 --> 00:39:16:03
A point of

546
00:39:16:03 --> 00:39:16:20
exchange.

547
00:39:16:20 --> 00:39:18:22
Of course, that's why there's so much mixing.

548
00:39:18:22 --> 00:39:23:00
My grandfather was Dutch, because he passed away.

549
00:39:23:00 --> 00:39:25:03
That's why my last name is Prince.

550
00:39:25:03 --> 00:39:26:00
That's what my grandfather said,

551
00:39:26:00 --> 00:39:29:19
my father, that when the ships arrived
on the coastal shore,

552
00:39:29:19 --> 00:39:34:08
in Puerto López, he arrived and fell in love with my grandmother.

553
00:39:34:20 --> 00:39:37:20
They lived on Carrizal beach, where we will go tomorrow,

554
00:39:38:02 --> 00:39:41:09
That's why that territory belongs to my father, but my own territory

555
00:39:41:09 --> 00:39:45:17
of the clan is around here, in the border area,
but I have rights because my dad was from there.

556
00:39:46:09 --> 00:39:50:19
And we always lived off
the traditional economy of the beach, which is fishing.

557
00:39:51:11 --> 00:39:52:20
And that's because we have the sea,

558
00:39:52:20 --> 00:39:58:08
we are "apalanchi" in our language,
"apalanchi" are people who have the sea.

559
00:40:01:15 --> 00:40:03:02
Well

560
00:40:03:02 --> 00:40:06:01
I have a question

561
00:40:06:01 --> 00:40:08:08
I would like to know

562
00:40:08:08 --> 00:40:11:00
if men are the ones who

563
00:40:11:00 --> 00:40:14:16
make the music,
what role do women have, what is their role?

564
00:40:14:16 --> 00:40:17:16
So beyond receiving the music,

565
00:40:18:09 --> 00:40:20:16
what role do they have?

566
00:40:20:16 --> 00:40:21:15
Well,

567
00:40:21:15 --> 00:40:24:00
women also play instruments

568
00:40:24:00 --> 00:40:26:18
there's an instrument that is played with the hand
but it's played by girls,

569
00:40:26:18 --> 00:40:30:06
not by older women, it's the wawai and the iruwai made from a small tree

570
00:40:30:06 --> 00:40:32:17
I don't have it here, but maybe they have it over there with the kids

571
00:40:32:17 --> 00:40:36:05
The kids can play that instrument,
most of the girls play it

572
00:40:37:00 --> 00:40:39:18
And also, as I mentioned before, for us,
it's very important for a woman
to be able to make music and those who sing "jayechi"

573
00:40:39:18 --> 00:40:44:14
in their "jayechi," they sing anecdotes

574
00:40:45:16 --> 00:40:49:04
of their history, of themselves,

575
00:40:49:13 --> 00:40:53:14
of what they experience, sadness or sorrow.

576
00:40:54:12 --> 00:40:57:16
Yes, like a song where they compose the music themselves.

577
00:40:58:11 --> 00:41:00:12
Yes, very important. Women also make music,

578
00:41:01:13 --> 00:41:04:05
but here, it depends on the fundamental work

579
00:41:04:05 --> 00:41:07:05
they do because in Wayuu culture,
we have a normative system

580
00:41:07:10 --> 00:41:12:15
a plan where each person has their fundamental occupation,
the woman has her fundamental occupation

581
00:41:13:00 --> 00:41:17:06
and the man also has his fundamental occupation,
that's why we always maintain the Wayuu culture

582
00:41:17:18 --> 00:41:20:16
and preserve cultural expressions through

583
00:41:20:16 --> 00:41:23:16
the social organization we have.

584
00:41:24:09 --> 00:41:26:08
What is the occupation of each one?

585
00:41:26:08 --> 00:41:28:18
What is the occupation of both women and men?

586
00:41:28:18 --> 00:41:31:02
Well, the occupation of women is diverse.

587
00:41:31:02 --> 00:41:32:17
There are women Outsü (spiritual guide)

588
00:41:32:17 --> 00:41:35:17
there are women Oulaküt (visionary)

589
00:41:35:18 --> 00:41:38:18
there are women einülü (craftswoman)

590
00:41:40:22 --> 00:41:43:00
and women eikülü (educator) and atükalü (ceramist)

591
00:41:43:00 --> 00:41:45:15
These are the five fundamental occupations of Wayuu women

592
00:41:45:15 --> 00:41:48:16
and for men, there's the pütchipüi (speaker)

593
00:41:49:07 --> 00:41:52:22
the Wayuu alaüla, who is

594
00:41:54:07 --> 00:41:57:22
the maternal uncle, Wayuu ekirajasu (teacher)

595
00:41:58:13 --> 00:42:02:01
sunai tu wakuwaipakat (our culture), that's how it would be seen,

596
00:42:02:17 --> 00:42:05:02
look, I have my hand here,

597
00:42:05:02 --> 00:42:09:00
This one here is the grandmother, and this is the mother

598
00:42:10:02 --> 00:42:11:13
and this one

599
00:42:11:13 --> 00:42:14:17
is the maternal uncle, and this one is the child,

600
00:42:14:21 --> 00:42:19:09
so to make my instrument, I have to grasp it

601
00:42:20:06 --> 00:42:23:22
from my grandmother, my mother, in order to grasp the knife
and they teach me how to make the instrument.

602
00:42:23:22 --> 00:42:26:22
The woman is always present in the worldview

603
00:42:28:06 --> 00:42:31:06
and here too, mom is here,

604
00:42:31:21 --> 00:42:34:21
oushi (grandmother), tatushi (my maternal uncle)

605
00:42:36:01 --> 00:42:38:11
because the achon (son)

606
00:42:38:11 --> 00:42:40:23
the achon here no longer has a clan,

607
00:42:40:23 --> 00:42:43:23
he is here, holding it, and I make the instrument in this way

608
00:42:44:13 --> 00:42:47:00
when I hold the reed, look, there it is

609
00:42:47:00 --> 00:42:50:00
holding the mother, oushi

610
00:42:50:19 --> 00:42:52:18
Grandmother and mother

611
00:42:52:18 --> 00:42:55:10
the Wayuu woman is always there

612
00:42:55:10 --> 00:42:58:11
and the maternal uncle here in the middle,

613
00:43:00:18 --> 00:43:01:17
this is the maternal uncle,

614
00:43:01:17 --> 00:43:05:09
he is the one who exercises authority, who enforces

615
00:43:06:00 --> 00:43:09:00
behavior within the community

616
00:43:09:23 --> 00:43:11:11
there they are.

617
00:43:11:11 --> 00:43:14:11
We are always five, five manifestations

618
00:43:14:23 --> 00:43:15:09
which are

619
00:43:19:21 --> 00:43:22:17
mother tongue, spirituality,

620
00:43:22:17 --> 00:43:26:19
territory, social organization, and traditional economy.

621
00:43:27:12 --> 00:43:29:14
There are the five on the finger

622
00:43:29:14 --> 00:43:32:03
and there are also the five.

623
00:43:32:03 --> 00:43:34:13
Grandmother

624
00:43:34:13 --> 00:43:37:12
What is this one? Mother, maternal uncle,

625
00:43:38:14 --> 00:43:41:14
the grandson, and achon (son)

626
00:43:43:19 --> 00:43:45:15
There are the five, and that is

627
00:43:45:15 --> 00:43:49:14
they are always part of the organization,
the woman is always present

628
00:43:50:16 --> 00:43:52:16
That's why it's called

629
00:43:52:16 --> 00:43:55:02
"eei" which means mother.

630
00:43:55:02 --> 00:43:58:14
Eei.

631
00:43:58:18 --> 00:44:00:11
Thank you.

632
00:44:00:11 --> 00:44:03:02
Well, if you had a message

633
00:44:03:02 --> 00:44:06:11
that you would like to share with the world, what would it be?

634
00:44:07:05 --> 00:44:09:19
The message would be

635
00:44:09:19 --> 00:44:15:05
well, these days we had the visit
of the president, it was quite hard for us,

636
00:44:15:14 --> 00:44:17:11
it was a good visit

637
00:44:17:11 --> 00:44:21:08
and what the president said about us,

638
00:44:23:06 --> 00:44:26:20
about what he said

639
00:44:28:21 --> 00:44:30:04
about us.

640
00:44:30:04 --> 00:44:33:03
I have always said one thing,

641
00:44:33:08 --> 00:44:36:06
life is sacred,

642
00:44:36:06 --> 00:44:40:03
life to make music is sacred, and life for us

643
00:44:41:07 --> 00:44:43:02
is very important,

644
00:44:43:02 --> 00:44:46:01
because when we die, we go to another life,

645
00:44:46:12 --> 00:44:51:12
we are not dead, that's why they hold wakes for us
and when our remains are exhumed

646
00:44:52:01 --> 00:44:55:01
they say that we are still alive and still here on earth,

647
00:44:56:02 --> 00:45:01:05
I mean, as I said at the beginning, we don't go
even to the right hand of God, we don't go to hell,

648
00:45:01:19 --> 00:45:05:18
instead, we have a long journey,
and that long journey is the message

649
00:45:05:18 --> 00:45:09:05
that I bring to the Wayuu community and to the whole world.

650
00:45:09:13 --> 00:45:12:08
to make them aware that

651
00:45:12:08 --> 00:45:15:08
in the department of La Guajira, there is an indigenous people

652
00:45:16:06 --> 00:45:18:09
that has its own music,

653
00:45:18:09 --> 00:45:21:07
that has spirituality, has principles,

654
00:45:21:07 --> 00:45:25:06
values to maintain the music
and harmony of the Wayuu people.

655
00:45:25:19 --> 00:45:28:19
That's the message I can bring, and for them to know

656
00:45:28:20 --> 00:45:32:08
the music, to listen to the "sawawa,"

657
00:45:33:13 --> 00:45:34:01
the sonorous music

658
00:45:34:01 --> 00:45:37:01
of our Wayuu instruments.

659
00:45:37:11 --> 00:45:40:22
And to confirm that everything you've said

660
00:45:41:15 --> 00:45:45:07
we have knowledge to use it in the documentary
and the music as well.

661
00:45:45:15 --> 00:45:46:12
Do you allow it? I mean,

662
00:45:46:12 --> 00:45:49:11
Would you allow us to use your music

663
00:45:49:13 --> 00:45:53:10
or what you played
to be part of this project we are working on?

664
00:45:54:06 --> 00:45:57:13
Well, yes, I can do that, but we

665
00:45:57:13 --> 00:46:00:13
are protective in the sense that

666
00:46:01:06 --> 00:46:03:14
it is for a good purpose

667
00:46:03:14 --> 00:46:06:14
not just for you but also for us,

668
00:46:06:16 --> 00:46:10:16
because you are taking a legacy
it's not something trivial

669
00:46:10:16 --> 00:46:14:03
because this is not something you can find in a music store,

670
00:46:14:11 --> 00:46:17:11
like a guitar, like a trumpet, you can't find

671
00:46:18:10 --> 00:46:21:02
any of these instruments or the Kasha.

672
00:46:21:02 --> 00:46:24:02
It's an effort that we make to manufacture
and create it.

673
00:46:24:19 --> 00:46:29:15
No, not to make it for the need to sell,
but a necessity that we have as a people.

674
00:46:29:15 --> 00:46:33:00
Wayuu to maintain and preserve our cultural expressions

675
00:46:33:00 --> 00:46:36:00
through our spirituality.

676
00:46:36:00 --> 00:46:39:00
So, if people see a picture of Saüyepia (the school)

677
00:46:39:01 --> 00:46:43:02
or maybe of me on social media and they are promoting it,

678
00:46:44:11 --> 00:46:45:11
they might think that I am

679
00:46:45:11 --> 00:46:48:15
selling, that I have money, and since I live here,

680
00:46:49:06 --> 00:46:53:18
these chairs, these benches are for the girls
and boys who come to listen to the music,

681
00:46:54:07 --> 00:46:57:20
this piece of zinc that you see there with holes,
is where we make the music.

682
00:46:58:05 --> 00:47:01:08
Not long ago, we won some money
and when the president came, we had those looms made

683
00:47:01:08 --> 00:47:07:19
so that the women and girls can make the "siira"
(men's sash) with the threads, and that was earned

684
00:47:07:19 --> 00:47:10:19
because someone came to give something to us.

685
00:47:10:20 --> 00:47:15:15
And we are going to Bogotá
to perform in the first week of August,

686
00:47:16:03 --> 00:47:19:11
we will spend a week there
a large group from Saüyepia, from the school

687
00:47:20:13 --> 00:47:23:09
to showcase the music and the dance expression.

688
00:47:23:09 --> 00:47:28:05
We are going to a gathering of indigenous peoples
and we are the ones representing La Guajira, the Wayuu people

689
00:47:28:05 --> 00:47:29:12
it's us from the school

690
00:47:31:10 --> 00:47:34:10
we will be there in the first week of August

691
00:47:34:14 --> 00:47:38:06
I will go with my group,
more than 15 girls here, between boys and girls

692
00:47:38:22 --> 00:47:41:22
and then I'll go alone on the 22nd

693
00:47:42:02 --> 00:47:43:12
until the 26th.

694
00:47:43:12 --> 00:47:46:12
That will be from August 6th to 13th at the Teatro Colón,

695
00:47:48:00 --> 00:47:51:08
we will perform at the Teatro Colón

696
00:47:51:11 --> 00:47:54:11
and at the Centro Nacional de Arte, the Nuevo Teatro.

697
00:47:54:17 --> 00:47:57:17
Maestro Iván Benavides,

698
00:47:58:05 --> 00:47:59:19
who is the director

699
00:47:59:19 --> 00:48:01:20
in Bogotá.

700
00:48:01:20 --> 00:48:04:20
From the sixth to the thirteenth of August.

701
00:48:05:09 --> 00:48:06:16
And then I come back again.

702
00:48:06:16 --> 00:48:09:21
I come with my big group,
and then I go alone with another person,

703
00:48:10:15 --> 00:48:13:15
I perform at the university, I think it's the Javeriana.

704
00:48:13:20 --> 00:48:17:05
From the 23rd to the 27th of the same month.

705
00:48:17:23 --> 00:48:20:23
So that's what I'm saying,
what we want is,

706
00:48:21:04 --> 00:48:25:11
maybe as a donation,
it's not for me, it's for all of us,

707
00:48:26:12 --> 00:48:29:12
that's how we sustain ourselves,

708
00:48:29:21 --> 00:48:34:10
and look for the materials because we can't find them here,

709
00:48:35:12 --> 00:48:38:23
we have to search for them in the Sierra de la Macuira
or in the Sierra Nevada,

710
00:48:38:23 --> 00:48:43:09
where the Wiwa people are, who lend us their territory,
and I have to ask for permission to gather the

711
00:48:43:09 --> 00:48:47:21
materials to maintain more instruments
and do everything

712
00:48:48:14 --> 00:48:51:09
with the children of the school.

713
00:48:51:09 --> 00:48:54:09
Yes, tomorrow we have an activity

714
00:48:54:19 --> 00:48:57:19
I'm inviting you because it's a community

715
00:48:58:07 --> 00:49:02:12
where they are going to hold an event, a harmonization ritual,
and they invite us to participate.

716
00:49:02:22 --> 00:49:05:18
I will talk to the people,
I'll tell them you're coming

717
00:49:05:18 --> 00:49:11:01
I know they won't say no, so you can come with us,
and maybe you can record a video or interview us,

718
00:49:11:01 --> 00:49:15:07
which also helps us to sustain ourselves.

719
00:49:15:07 --> 00:49:15:17
the

720
00:49:17:07 --> 00:49:20:02
the school, you know.

721
00:49:20:02 --> 00:49:22:14
If what we don't want is that

722
00:49:22:14 --> 00:49:24:22
because it has happened to us
not only with people

723
00:49:24:22 --> 00:49:29:05
like you but also with people from here in La Guajira
who sometimes take our material and publish it.

724
00:49:29:05 --> 00:49:32:05
At least it happened during the pandemic
they took images

725
00:49:33:03 --> 00:49:36:21
from a video we made, for a festival in Uribia,
but there was no festival

726
00:49:37:13 --> 00:49:40:13
and the authorities took it
took it and published it during the pandemic

727
00:49:40:13 --> 00:49:44:13
and all the mothers called me because I hadn't seen
that the girls were in the publication

728
00:49:44:13 --> 00:49:48:11
and I called, I sent a formal request to the governor, and immediately
they took it down from the networks

729
00:49:49:13 --> 00:49:53:15
and I left it at that because I wanted to, I didn't want to,
I didn't want to sue them for copyright either

730
00:49:54:01 --> 00:49:57:01
because they didn't have permission to publish that

731
00:49:57:14 --> 00:50:00:00
and they were selling that as material.

732
00:50:00:00 --> 00:50:03:07
And that's because we really didn't give
any permission, and it has happened to us several times

733
00:50:03:07 --> 00:50:07:03
with images of us
because, honestly, and it's not to tell a lie

734
00:50:08:15 --> 00:50:10:16
The only school that exists

735
00:50:10:16 --> 00:50:13:16
with Wayuu characteristics is us.

736
00:50:15:03 --> 00:50:18:10
And here in La Guajira
there are more than 600 cultural foundations

737
00:50:18:22 --> 00:50:21:17
We are a cultural foundation through the school

738
00:50:21:17 --> 00:50:24:19
and we are the only ones with cultural character
it's us

739
00:50:25:08 --> 00:50:30:02
and we showed it to the Ministry of Culture
when the president came.

740
00:50:31:19 --> 00:50:32:05
we

741
00:50:32:05 --> 00:50:36:05
we met with the Minister of Culture and the Vice Minister

742
00:50:36:05 --> 00:50:39:12
they sat down with the entire Ministry's leadership,

743
00:50:39:14 --> 00:50:43:02
Population, Heritage, with us

744
00:50:43:07 --> 00:50:46:16
and they didn't let anyone else in

745
00:50:47:10 --> 00:50:49:19
because many people wanted to enter,

746
00:50:49:19 --> 00:50:54:05
here at the Mayor's Office, and they said no,
we are only going to have the meeting with Saüyepia with you from the school,

747
00:50:55:09 --> 00:50:56:15
So that was just for us.

748
00:50:56:15 --> 00:51:01:13
They took an impression of us
asked, "How do you live? Why do you do this?"

749
00:51:01:13 --> 00:51:04:04
"What time have you been working with culture?"

750
00:51:04:04 --> 00:51:05:21
We told them everything.

751
00:51:05:21 --> 00:51:10:15
Firstly, the truth is that we do not have support
from the municipality or the department, we live on what

752
00:51:10:17 --> 00:51:13:17
suddenly comes, people like you who visit us and bring us

753
00:51:14:10 --> 00:51:17:12
that's how we live and from politicians

754
00:51:18:09 --> 00:51:20:14
that sometimes give us coats, shoes when we go to Bogota

755
00:51:20:14 --> 00:51:25:05
so we live from donations.

756
00:51:25:05 --> 00:51:28:05
We work with cooperation

757
00:51:28:19 --> 00:51:32:12
we have some allies,
a school just like this one, but for African drums
we have

758
00:51:32:15 --> 00:51:36:04
and I have drums in there that have been given to us,
they are a school of drums

759
00:51:36:19 --> 00:51:40:13
in La Boquilla, Cartagena, which are Afro drums.

760
00:51:41:05 --> 00:51:44:21
and we have a project called School
of Knowledge of Cultural Rights.

761
00:51:46:10 --> 00:51:49:10
With them, we create a cultural life plan

762
00:51:50:00 --> 00:51:53:00
to maintain and preserve everything cultural.

763
00:51:54:14 --> 00:51:54:20
That's why I'm telling you

764
00:51:54:20 --> 00:51:57:23
I told my friend that not just anyone

765
00:51:58:14 --> 00:52:01:13
we let in, only those who do this,

766
00:52:01:13 --> 00:52:04:12
Yes, yes, because it has value,

767
00:52:04:12 --> 00:52:10:03
not just money, but cultural value,
the value it has as a people

768
00:52:10:03 --> 00:52:13:03
which is ancient, what we have.

769
00:52:13:17 --> 00:52:16:01
Well, then we'll keep in touch,

770
00:52:16:01 --> 00:52:19:21
We collaborate, and before publishing anything, first

771
00:52:20:04 --> 00:52:24:10
Of course, with our name,
the address of a school here in La Guajira,

772
00:52:25:00 --> 00:52:28:00
of course, exactly with our name

773
00:52:28:04 --> 00:52:30:05
and yes, look

774
00:52:30:05 --> 00:52:34:08
I'm also going to give you a photo

775
00:52:36:06 --> 00:52:36:17
and a thousand more.

776
00:52:36:17 --> 00:52:39:16
That's it,

777
00:52:39:16 --> 00:52:42:10
what I'm up to.

778
00:52:42:10 --> 00:52:45:10
You don't have to

779
00:52:49:05 --> 00:52:52:05
do.

780
00:52:56:23 --> 00:52:59:02
It's good to start with the introduction and

781
00:52:59:02 --> 00:53:02:02
Well,
it's a photo that I'm going to give you, a Polaroid.

782
00:53:02:02 --> 00:53:04:12
I don't know if you've seen it, but it shows...

783
00:53:06:13 --> 00:53:09:12
But before we do that,

784
00:53:09:12 --> 00:53:12:20
Can you say it again

785
00:53:12:20 --> 00:53:15:20
Just so we make sure that

786
00:53:16:06 --> 00:53:18:19
Of course, where are we now?

787
00:53:18:19 --> 00:53:19:09
The school.

788
00:53:19:09 --> 00:53:22:14
And I say that in Wayuunaiki is fine too.

789
00:53:23:06 --> 00:53:25:23
What do I have to say?

790
00:53:25:23 --> 00:53:27:19
Just your name.

791
00:53:27:19 --> 00:53:30:19
And that you authorize in the school.

792
00:53:30:19 --> 00:53:33:01
In the school

793
00:53:33:01 --> 00:53:35:16
which is what it's called here

794
00:53:35:16 --> 00:53:40:07
My name is such, we are in your school
in Uribia

795
00:53:40:13 --> 00:53:44:08
The date, and we are sharing a bit
of our knowledge.

796
00:53:44:15 --> 00:53:47:15
Okay? Music, okay.

797
00:53:47:20 --> 00:53:49:04
Got it.

798
00:53:49:04 --> 00:53:51:19
Well, my name is Joaquín Prince

799
00:53:51:19 --> 00:53:55:01
from the Eirüku Jayariyu, and we are here

800
00:53:55:02 --> 00:54:01:15
at the traditional school "Semillero Wayuu," Saüyepia Wayuu,

and sharing with you

801
00:54:01:15 --> 00:54:04:17
the cultural richness through music, through

802
00:54:04:17 --> 00:54:07:17
the spirituality of our community.

803
00:54:07:18 --> 00:54:10:17
Well, thank you for this visit

804
00:54:10:17 --> 00:54:15:04
It's very good that you come, get to know
all this cultural legacy that we have.

805
00:54:16:09 --> 00:54:18:06
As you can see, this is the space we have

806
00:54:18:06 --> 00:54:21:23
this is a sacred space for us,

807
00:54:21:23 --> 00:54:24:23
because here we maintain all the richness with spirituality

808
00:54:24:23 --> 00:54:28:04
of the Master Jorge Enrique,
who passed away, leaving us this legacy.

809
00:54:29:05 --> 00:54:31:15
And we want you to know it as well,

810
00:54:31:15 --> 00:54:34:15
that you take it far and get to know the school

811
00:54:34:20 --> 00:54:39:03
that from where Colombia begins,
there is a school that is strengthening

812
00:54:39:03 --> 00:54:42:10
and preserving the richness of Wayuu music.
