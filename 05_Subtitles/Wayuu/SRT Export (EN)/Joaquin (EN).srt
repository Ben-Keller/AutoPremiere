I'm a cultural manager,

I've been working on an educational process

here in this space that you see, and there are also other spaces

20
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,333

00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,166
Well, I spoke in my language, and now I will switch back.

42
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:26,416
Let me repeat now so that you understand. I said that we are
I said that we are

43
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,416
the guardians of the land,

44
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,583
there was an ancient time,

45
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,333
as the elders say.

46
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:37,375
There was a beginning, an ancient time

47
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:40,375
when our father Juya arrived,

48
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,708
who is the rain, for us, he is rain and not just rain, because he is a man

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,291
and the land is our

50
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,750
ancient mother, he arrives,

51
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,833
it rains, inseminating her, making love to her,

52
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:58,125
and from our mother, plants are born, the first beings, then

53
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,291
the animals, and third, the birds.

54
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,708
And in the fourth generation, us,
the humans, the Wayúu people.

55
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,708
But it was a woman.

56
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,583
As the elders say, the land

57
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:18,125
is very sacred to us.
It's our mother,

58
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:23,166
and we should not sell it,
because we are not owners of the land,

59
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:26,250
it owns us,
because we are born from it,

60
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,291
and we return to it when we die.

61
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,041
That's why it is very important

62
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,541
to preserve the instruments and the music

63
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:39,375
through thought, through the heart, and through the wind,
because my body

64
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,541
is the one that creates music through thought and through the wind.

65
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,500
And that's why our ancestors exist,

66
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,000
the wind, the wind, Papa,

67
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:54,666
our wind
that blows and forms whirlwinds

68
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,625
born in nature, that teaches us how to make music.

69
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:05,291
I'm going to play a tune, which I told you is called
"La Crianza en la Tierra Wayakana Shipi'jala tüü mmakat."

70
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,125
We are the guardians of the land.

71
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,458
And that's how it is.

72
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:13,000
Just a moment before starting
to change the Atlantic configuration,

73
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,708
set workers.

74
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,791
From the State, Stars of Iberoamerica Context

75
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,583
Ready.

76
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:32,125
It's like that.

77
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:41,750
Oh, oh oh oh.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,500
Oh, oh, oh

79
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,208
Oh, oh, oh

80
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,375
Well, this is another instrument

81
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,375
also made by us, just as I told you before,

82
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,666
it's called Maasi.

83
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,458
We use this during herding,

84
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,041
and to communicate with other companions.

85
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,625
That's why I said it's better to do it in the community

86
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,625
to have the spiritual connection.

87
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,708
The wind helps us make the music,
so it also helps us communicate

88
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,916
through the music,
so with it, I'll tell you a story,

89
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:37,916
when we're herding,

90
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,916
we communicate, each one has their rhythm,
their sound

91
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,708
and distinctive sound.

92
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,708
If I hear a sound, I say, "That's Pedro's,"

93
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,666
if it's a different sound,
it's Juan's, and mine is also different.

94
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,458
So, I communicate with Pedro through the music,

95
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:59,791
it's like having a dialogue through playing,
asking if he has seen a lost sheep

96
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,250
when I'm herding, and that's how it is.

97
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,333
That sound is made by us,

98
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:04,166
the music, the music, we create it from our minds,
we only need our ears,

99
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,083
ears and thinking, thinking with nature.

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,583
Plants, the air, they are the ones that help us

101
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,583
make music, interpreting the sound.

102
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,208
That's why it's important for us,

103
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:21,500
these plants had a life,
this material comes from a plant, it returns to another life.

104
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Now, it's speaking and singing to us.

105
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,875
It's still alive

106
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:30,583
You know, they are born, they reproduce,
but as you say, "arijuna,"

107
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,625
we say "arijuna" because they're not Wayuu. No,
it died for you, but

108
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,666
for us, it's alive, it has another life,

109
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:40,500
and it's speaking through my body,
through the wind I'm creating.

110
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,666
It doesn't talk,

111
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,666
and that's why the sound, it has a high and a low pitch.

112
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,083
See, this is the high one,

113
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:59,083
and this is the low one,

114
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,916
this is the maasi, in our language.

115
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:16,125
"Ontoroyoi" in our language has no name in Spanish.

116
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,625
In truth, the elders say we made this out of necessity

117
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,958
to maintain the harmony of the Wayuu people and to

118
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:28,000
keep friendship among those of us who coexist.
And that's how music is for sadness,

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,750
when we want to court a woman,
a female, we do it with this too.

120
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,375
This one is called "sawawa,"

121
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,166
we use this ourselves too,

122
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:41,875
Young men use it to court women,
with a feeling when we are sad,

123
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:47,291
when we are in love,
we make music with the help of nature too.

124
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,833
When we hear the birds,

125
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,875
we make music, the birds help us create

126
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,875
the music, along with the wind and the sea.

127
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,125
This is a song here of a Wayuu in love, and it goes like this,

128
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:43,500
Oh, oh, oh.

129
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,250
Well, that's the sawawa,

130
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,250
as I told you, it's made by us,

131
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,708
and these are materials from nature,

132
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,708
these instruments have a ritual, these three,

133
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:03,083
these instruments can only be played during the day and night,

134
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:07,166
we can't play them at night, maybe when I travel to a city.

135
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,125
But in our territory, I can't do it,
and if I play them at night, I have to ask for permission

136
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:18,250
from Mother Earth and Father Rain,
because they have a ritual.

137
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,500
They say that at that hour,
after six when the sun sets, they are already resting.

138
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:28,625
We can't bother them in the morning so that
they wake up with that musical sound,

139
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:32,583
to bring joy to our territory,
and only men play them.

140
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,208
Sure, a woman can do it too,
but for us Wayuu, it's frowned upon.

141
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,625
Maybe you can do it, a non-Wayuu woman can do it,

142
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:43,208
but a Wayuu woman cannot,
because it's a fundamental craft of the men.

143
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,833
At the moment of herding,
at the moment of searching for water at the Jagüey or the casimba,

144
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,250
and at the moment when feeling something for a woman.

145
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,541
That's why the instruments are very important, so they know
what Wayuu music is and what these instruments are used for.

146
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,500
This one is called "ontoroyoi," sorry,

147
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,000
turompa, this one is called "birimbao," they call it mouth harp,

148
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,416
it's a well-known instrument among various indigenous groups,

149
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,958
it was brought by colonizers.

150
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:14,750
We adapted it
in a way that suits us and made it for ourselves,

151
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,833
we manufacture it, women and men can play this one,

152
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,458
as you can see, it's made of metal, very different from the plant.

153
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,916
Plants have life, this one never had life,
and this one is made

154
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,916
by humans and is riveted, whereas this one has

155
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:34,083
a more spiritual character to make it,

156
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,291
these ones made from plants,

157
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:42,083
I'll play a tune for you, it's called the flutter of birds, at this time

158
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:45,958
the birds are fluttering to rest,

159
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:50,583
and they start doing it like this
and when it rains, they also start fluttering.

160
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:19,500
Oh, oh, oh

161
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,833
Oh, oh, oh.

162
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,750
Oh, oh, oh

163
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:37,208
You

164
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,875
Are you blowing or just using your mouth?

165
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:44,166
Not just the mouth, the mouth is for resonance, and I inhale

166
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,166
and blow, but not very forcefully, softly.

167
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,708
Yes, the mouth provides resonance, and

168
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:54,000
I have to press my teeth together here
for it to produce the vibration

169
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,500
from the reed in the center.

170
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,625
That's interesting.

171
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,625
They are alive, but you are alive too.

172
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,583
Yes, I'm using this one, yes, correct.

173
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,291
Yes, correct.

174
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:09,666
So, for us, it's important to preserve the music. This is the tambora.

175
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:14,500
Now, this is the kasha we use for dancing
at the yonna. We use

176
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,541
the dance rhythms at the yonna. There's one called the horse race,

177
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,541
That's why I wanted to play it, and

178
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:24,958
I was inviting you all
because in the community, one can focus

179
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,125
for longer periods,
because you hear noise here and noise there.

180
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:35,250
So, it's not clear: in the community, nature helps us
to concentrate, and that way, things truly become

181
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,791
evident, what we are, the music, and

182
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,625
and maybe I'll bring another musician from the school because it's
different

183
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:48,000
what he plays compared to what I do, it has a different sound,
it's the same instrument,

184
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,958
the same tune, but it has another language.

185
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,125
The sound is different, each one has their touch.

186
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,125
It's like if he composes a song, it's
different from the one I compose,

187
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:03,458
That's Wayuu music, we create it, and it's very important to us.

188
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,458
As I said, the wind

189
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:10,916
and the whirlwind, we call it "pichikua"
in our language, "pichikua" means whirlwind,

190
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,666
and "jo'utai" means wind,

191
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:19,083
because in our bodies,
we create music through the wind, thought, and heart,

192
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:23,416
and what you think,
we turn into music with the help of the instrument.

193
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:28,958
That's why it's very important to preserve Wayuu music
and for you to know about it.

194
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,791
Taking the music to another level

195
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,541
with other instruments that are not Wayuu,

196
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:41,916
we are already doing it, the functions and trials,
and it has given us excellent results.

197
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,208
Yes, maybe combining the music of

198
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:50,791
reggaeton with the turompa,
the tambora with African calling drum,

199
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:56,250
we are doing all this musical work
to preserve and maintain our cultural richness,

200
00:14:56,791 --> 00:15:01,541
without forgetting about ourselves,
our language, our spirituality,

201
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:05,500
our territory,

202
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,500
our clan, which is our social organization,

203
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,208
and the traditional economy where you live.

204
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:15,666
These five main pillars are very important,
which are our cultural expressions that are

205
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:20,416
within the Wayuu normative system,
and our voices should always be in our
language, that's why I started

206
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:25,416
speaking in my language, which is Wayunaiki,
that's why it's important,

207
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:30,250
Wayunaiki means "people of good thinking,"
wayuu ana'a eki

208
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,166
people of good thinking or good head.

209
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,958
So, I invite you to join us, I don't know what you think,

210
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,583
you can come with us tomorrow to that place,

211
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,125
it's a very beautiful place,

212
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,916
and I have to call and let them know that we are coming with you.

213
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,958
So, yes, that's the plan, I don't know.

214
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,125
If it works for you

215
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,666
And about what you were talking to me at the beginning,
about the harmony or the harmony of the music

216
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:59,166
Can you talk a little more about that,
about preserving harmony?

217
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,708
There is already harmony in nature, and for me,

218
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:10,041
it seems like the music is trying to reach that harmony, to be more connected.

219
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:25,125
If we maintain music through spirituality,

220
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:30,000
through spiritual connection, I can play the instrument here,
but it's not the same as playing it in my community.

221
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,333
It's different there because I have a connection with nature,

222
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,541
with the birds and animals,

223
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,500
and the plants are what help me

224
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,500
to maintain that energy

225
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,625
and the body,

226
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,333
because with my body, I think,

227
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,333
because we are the fourth generation.

228
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,541
we do the sound interpretation

229
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,083
and not so much with our fingers

230
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,625
but with what I think and what I see,
because one learns through observation.

231
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,916
Yes, what I hear, I put my ear to it

232
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,916
I hear the birds very well, I hear

233
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,041
the waves of the sea, I hear the

234
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,875
fluttering of the birds,

235
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:19,875
I also hear the plants as they move. All of that

236
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,375
is what teaches us how to make music together,

237
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,791
with that we make our music and also

238
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,791
the animals like the birds.

239
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,791
That's why I played a little bit of the fluttering of the birds.

240
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,541
It's all through nature,

241
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
that's why music is very important to us

242
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:45,208
and within our community,
because it helps us create harmony

243
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,500
and spiritual connotation,
because there is spiritual music like the tambora,

244
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,125
there is healing music that helps heal the sick

245
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,750
and helps ward off negative energies.

246
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,750
During the time of COVID

247
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,958
there was a dream from women, spiritual authorities
of the Wayuu people

248
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,708
because there is a spiritual authority of women.

249
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,708
There was a dream she had where a yonna dance had to be performed,
which is a dance,

250
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,416
that's why I said it was better to explain
there how it was and that the tambora had to be played, which is the kasha.

251
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,416
in order for that COVID energy to go away

252
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:24,000
and he said we should place a plant called malu'a

253
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,916
which has good energy and

254
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,166
that way, the energy of COVID

255
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,666
wouldn't reach our territory
and indeed it didn't affect us much, only impacted

256
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:37,625
the city and urban areas, and that helped us a lot

257
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,708
to preserve through music.

258
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:43,250
It helped us defend ourselves from illnesses, bad energies

259
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,041
and to preserve what one desires and feels.

260
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,291
Yes, it has power

261
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,666
I have taken it to the Philharmonic Orchestra of Bogota,

262
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,166
yes, there we are preparing for a performance,

263
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,708
we are testing with other instruments,
like the violin,

264
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:03,041
like those big drums, we are conducting all the tests

265
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,291
to present it in a sonorous way

266
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,291
that can be showcased to the world.

267
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:12,208
In the Wayuu village,
we also have an instrument.

268
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:13,875
Even though it's small,

269
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:17,625
this instrument, called sonoros, holds a special
meaning for us,

270
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:22,041
it's very, very spiritual for us,
very important for the Wayuu people

271
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:26,041
and that's why we preserve it through the school
we have here,

272
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,333
teaching the boys and girls

273
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,666
about Wayuu music, why we do it and how we do it,

274
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,208
and why it's important to maintain Wayuu music.

275
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,916
And can you tell me a bit about that?

276
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:45,750
More about the school and what we are going to do tomorrow?

277
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,291
Well, you see the image there,
that's Maestro Jorge Enrique,

278
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:54,583
a Wayuu music teacher who taught me, he passed away.

279
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,875
He's resting in Jepira because when we die, we don't

280
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:03,166
go to heaven
nor to the right hand of God, we embark on a long journey

281
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,375
to the paradise of the dead, which

282
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,500
is where you go to the Cabo de la Vela, and our soul rests there

283
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,500
We embark on a long journey

284
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:15,458
and through everything we feel and do.

285
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,875
The elders say

286
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,833
that we become water,

287
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:26,041
we fall into the sea there in Cabo or Jepira, and then

288
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,541
it evaporates, rises to the sky, and falls back to the earth

289
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,625
to fertilize the land and

290
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:36,750
We return to another life,
the plants are the same.

291
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,625
In the Wayuu village, we don't pollute the plants,

292
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,375
we don't harm nature,

293
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:48,666
but there have been many people
who have come to pollute our territory

294
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:53,166
and some Wayuu people have also learned to do that, and that has also lost

295
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:57,541
the way of preserving, taking care of the instruments because there are plants that are no longer there

296
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,541
in some parts, so we have to look for them
in other territories

297
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:07,583
because in our culture, there is a space that is only
reserved for the plants, and that cannot be disturbed.

298
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,583
It's as if it were our heart, it's the Wayuu,

299
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:14,083
that's where we plant,
we maintain all the crops so we can eat

300
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,041
because everywhere else
we can't plant, only in that specific area,

301
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:21,333
which the Wayuu identifies through the heart,
and there are the plants

302
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,958
and the musical instruments where we can make
each instrument to play

303
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,500
the sawawa, the maasi, and the ontoroyoi.

304
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,833
Through that.

305
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,208
Do you choose a plant yourself?

306
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,500
Yes, we make it ourselves,
I personally make it, I search for the plant,

307
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,750
they have their time, the moment when I can cut them,

308
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,916
I can't cut them anytime,

309
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,416
they have their moon time

310
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,666
and I can't cut them. We

311
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,958
ask permission from Mother Earth through rituals

312
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:55,250
to be able to cut the plants. I can't just

313
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,500
cut them at any time, no, they have their time.

314
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,333
And is there

315
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,583
a connection between dance and music?

316
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:12,333
I mean, I've seen that the drums don't.

317
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:13,958
Yes, the dance of the yonna

318
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,291
is done with the Kasha, which for us is a drum

319
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:21,333
and during the dance

320
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,541
There's a ritual we perform before the dance

321
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,708
in a sacred space called piyoi, which is a circle.

322
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,666
A circle where the girls dance barefoot,

323
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,416
sometimes, these days, as the sun has been very hot,

324
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:39,666
they've had to dance in a space wearing sandals,
but it's always barefoot.

325
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:44,875
They wear their red patterned shawl, symbolizing
what red represents,

326
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:48,791
our blood, the land,
especially what relates to spirituality.

327
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:51,791
And there are different dances,

328
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:56,500
what do they show there? The steps, like those of the alcaraván,
they do the step of the tortolita,

329
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,875
the dove, the vulture,
everything that exists in nature,

330
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:04,458
showing all the richness we see in our territory,

331
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,500
that's what they portray through the dance. The Yonna dance

332
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,750
is a challenge between the man and the woman, in the strength they measure.

333
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,791
That's why the man goes backward
and the woman goes forward always.

334
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:19,333
And there, the woman's skill is more evident than the man's.

335
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,041
That's why it's important for the woman in the

336
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:25,125
dance to wear her veil (kiara) beautifully,

337
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:28,416
her face adorned with palisha (red powder)

338
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:31,250
and her hair elegantly styled.

339
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,250
That's what adds beauty to the yonna dance.

340
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:43,916
Yes, that's very good

341
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:49,208
It could also be possible to play a little more.

342
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,708
Well, yes,

343
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:55,000
Well, let's play a bit here

344
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,291
On the drum too,

345
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:00,583
but I can stand up because I have to stand up

346
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:07,250
Alright, I'll put

347
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,250
this inside the pocket if you want.

348
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,333
Right there.

349
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:33,333
Yes. No, no!

350
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,166
Well, the rhythm that

351
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:37,708
I'm going to play is a rhythm

352
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,958
of yonna.

353
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:42,958
It's the traditional dance

354
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:54,875
of the Yonna.

355
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:55,125
I'm going to play

356
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:58,125
a rhythm of the horse race.

357
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,750
Well, those are the rhythms

358
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,750
that we play with the kasha
and well, with the Yonna dance, we play more.

359
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:46,208
Well.

360
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:49,041
What else could it be?

361
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:53,708
We'd be happy to listen.

362
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:57,041
You can play the song if you want,

363
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:59,291
the one you said you were going to play, another one.

364
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:02,208
No, no, if you want, I can play another instrument.

365
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:05,250
Let's continue, that was the sound of the turompa, and

366
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:06,958
Well,

367
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,958
I'm going to play the turompa with a sound

368
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:13,125
called the jumping dog

369
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:16,416
or the jayariyu dog

370
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:19,333
it's called the jayariyu dog, meaning from my clan

371
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:22,333
We identify ourselves with eirüku.

372
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:27,333
Well, you Arijunas call it a clan,
but it's not a clan, it's the eiruku

373
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,500
which is my

374
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:35,666
mother, who are part of the interclanial,
they are a family to us

375
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:39,666
we don't have any interclanial part,

376
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:42,708
at least my children are not my children,

377
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,166
my children are the children of my sisters,

378
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:48,041
and the children of their daughters are my children

379
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,416
because they belong to my clan, my eirüku

380
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:56,500
and we play a tune from the eirüku like this.

381
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,750
Oh, oh, oh

382
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:08,208
Oh, oh, oh

383
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,375
un muy

384
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:15,375
Oh, oh, oh

385
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:35,291
Oh, oh, oh

386
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:44,250
Well, that's a rhythm

387
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,625
that I have always played,
and with music, melodies as well,

388
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:51,291
I play it with fusion music with other non-Wayuu instruments.

389
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:54,583
I'm going to play a rhythm,

390
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:57,583
about what one feels, what one thinks,

391
00:28:58,208 --> 00:29:01,041
what

392
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:03,666
is called, it's called the sounds of the earth.

393
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:07,750
Yes, when you feel the earth, you feel the wind, a noise,

394
00:29:08,541 --> 00:29:11,583
and it's in this way like this.

395
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:11,583
How do you learn your songs?

396
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:16,041
Do you create some yourself,
but do others pass down through generations?

397
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:20,500
No, no, no, the music comes from oneself,
sometimes we imitate others

398
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,458
another rhythm from a fellow musician,
but most of it comes from our own inspiration

399
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:29,541
in the moment one thinks and feels
and what one sees

400
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:34,166
as I just mentioned, in nature,
these are the things that teach us

401
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,791
The teachers are the plants, animals, and birds

402
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:39,125
The wind makes the music.

403
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:43,708
Well,
I think we are going to play the casimba rhythm here.

404
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:50,500
When you draw water from the well,
it produces sounds that are sounds of lament.

405
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:53,541
And it goes like this.

406
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:15,625
Oh oh, oh

407
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:27,333
oh. Oh

408
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:29,333
Those are the sounds.

409
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:31,833
What is that thing down there?

410
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:34,166
This is a calabash, called "aliita"

411
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:37,166
in Wayunaiki, it's a gourd that we have
This is "mokochira" (plant).

412
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:40,250
Yes, we always put this on it, sometimes

413
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:43,250
as an ornament to hold it.

414
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,916
And it can be disassembled like this

415
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:47,916
so we can store it

416
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,541
It can be taken apart and assembled like clarinets.

417
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:55,416
Right?

418
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:59,083
They call them the same way.

419
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,250
And that's it.

420
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,875
In which

421
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:02,708
environments?

422
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:04,708
Usually, the music is played

423
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:06,250
I mean, during the day.

424
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,000
Well, I was saying some are for the night.

425
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Yes, some of them have specific rituals.

426
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,791
This instrument is only for daytime,

427
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:15,333
it cannot be played

428
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,458
at night because, according to the elders,
if we do so at night, it calls

429
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:22,666
bad energies, because at that time they are resting,

430
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:26,583
they rest to think,

431
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:30,250
to prepare for the next day and speak, speaking well,

432
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,791
the horn normally, yes.

433
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:36,791
The "kasha" can also be played at any time,

434
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:39,791
because "kasha" is sometimes used for food gatherings.

435
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,166
They say the "tambora" too.

436
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:46,833
We copied the drums that the Spaniards brought
to our territory with snare drums.

437
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:50,250
We observed them and, because of the need the Wayuu people had

438
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:54,333
to create something harmonious to maintain the sound,
to keep the dance.

439
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:57,625
And that's how the "kasha" was created, but using our own materials,

440
00:32:57,625 --> 00:33:02,041
like the plant: this is a plant, and these are animal skins.

441
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:05,791
Here, we have the generational aspect that is part of
our cosmovision.

442
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:09,541
of the generational aspect while playing exactly.

443
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:12,958
And this, well, it's a material that has no life,

444
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:17,791
it's metallic, brought by the colonizers,

445
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,958
and then we make music with it.

446
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,291
And what about the red thing?

447
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:28,875
We use this as an ornament to maintain the
energy and harmony.

448
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:32,041
to identify ourselves because this one is mine.

449
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:35,083
I identify myself with this color
and the colors and the tassel,

450
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:38,708
so we use it as an ornament to keep it that way.

451
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:43,041
And what's that thing there?

452
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:46,625
This is a "Koushut," that's what it's called,

453
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:51,666
but today we make it as the maestro Enrique has it,
with a feather, it's called "karatsü,"

454
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:57,208
and it's used for dancing the "yonna," as part of the presentation,
but it's used more to identify us

455
00:33:57,666 --> 00:34:00,958
if one is a good musician,
a good craftsman.

456
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:04,000
Yes, in the past, it was used to identify during wars,

457
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,083
when there were interclan or Spanish wars,
they would wear it.

458
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:12,416
There's one called "tu'upana,"
and this one is called "koushut."

459
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:16,666
They wore them to identify themselves
amongst each other, to show who was the leader

460
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:21,791
So it's a symbol of leadership within the interclan group.

461
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:25,041
If I wear it, I identify myself a lot,

462
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:28,041
and people recognize me with this a lot.

463
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:31,208
wherever I go, I have ones in different colors,

464
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,083
depending on the outfit I wear, the guayabera,

465
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:39,000
or if I wear my traditional clothing, perhaps

466
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:42,041
if you come tomorrow, you'll see me dressed in it.

467
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,166
How important do you consider music?

468
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:51,125
Is it like everyone in the community ends up

469
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:55,166
being a musician in some way,
the children, the adults?

470
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,250
How does music affect you?
How does it change you?

471
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:04,625
Music comes as a legacy,
a legacy of the family.

472
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,208
Not all Wayuu are musicians, it's a legacy.

473
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:13,291
And if we teach the children all the instruments, maybe they'll learn one

474
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:14,625
the one they like, maybe

475
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:17,875
this one or any other, but not all of them will learn.

476
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:21,458
If I have 40 children, all 40
won't learn to play all the instruments.

477
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:24,750
Maybe one or two will become good at playing

478
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,791
the maasi or the sawawa, but

479
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:31,125
over time they grow to like it and they learn it

480
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:32,791
on their own,

481
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:37,541
by listening and observing. We learn
through observation and listening,

482
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:41,958
we don't write, we don't record,

483
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:45,208
it's all by ear, just listening and observing.

484
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:46,916
That's how we learn.

485
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:49,958
And that's the legacy we have in school,
the legacy left by my uncle.

486
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:53,750
Master Jorge Enrique, who is there in the picture,
the legacy of our grandparents,

487
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:56,791
that's the legacy they give us, and they are concerned

488
00:35:56,791 --> 00:36:00,125
because they say that those of us who are left,

489
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:04,541
because they have already gone to rest in jepira,
we have to preserve and conserve

490
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:09,916
the music through this,
what we do as a school, we call it

491
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:13,750
Ekiraja in our language, but

492
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,958
in your art as arijuna (non-Wayuu),

493
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,375
we call it school, as you can see the looms as well,

494
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:24,041
the women make their weavings
which we need to wear the siira (traditional dress).

495
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:25,791
Everything has a legacy

496
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:29,958
and a spiritual connotation,
because that's what women allow us to do,

497
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:33,041
If we don't make the music, if we don't have women

498
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:36,041
to make these things for us, we can't make the music

499
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:38,250
because with them, we also

500
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,250
think and feel to sing
and make music for them.

501
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:46,333
And songs? Are there songs about love too?

502
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:49,250
Yes, yes, there are songs, Jayechi,

503
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,333
but I don't sing Jayechi because it's a spiritual song.

504
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:59,458
Yes, that's it, everyone has their own theme,

505
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:03,833
and those songs are mostly sung by people who are experienced

506
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:07,625
if there's a spiritual healing song,
it's sung by a woman Outsü,

507
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:10,583
who is the spiritual authority, sung by women singers, and

508
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:13,041
and men also sing it

509
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:16,333
during parties
when they are drinking, when there's chirrinchi (Wayuu alcoholic beverage)
they start singing Jayechi

510
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:19,875
and they are anecdotes that tell their history

511
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,333
in their language.

512
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:24,708
And are there songs

513
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:29,083
that are not their own,
but have been passed down? I mean, songs

514
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:33,208
that everyone knows or that musicians know someone created

515
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:37,333
and have been interpreted again

516
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:41,416
No, if you hear

517
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:45,166
a Wayuu singing a non-Wayuu song, he might sing a ranchera.

518
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,375
Why?

519
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:51,083
Because on the coast,
the first people who arrived in our territory

520
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,500
were Mexicans.

521
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,583
That's what our elders tell us.

522
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:59,750
That's why we use the tin cups where
you drank from

523
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:02,708
are from Mexico.

524
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:06,791
Those tin cups are not from us: they came since the conquest.

525
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:11,333
So if you ask an elderly Wayuu man to sing you a song,

526
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:12,583
he might sing a ranchera.

527
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:16,916
Why? Because it's a legacy that comes from
years ago,

528
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:21,583
our elders say that within our music,
the first music that arrived,

529
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:24,250
which is not ours, was rancheras.

530
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,250
Not even vallenato, because vallenato was created here.

531
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:29,833
The accordion vallenato was created here

532
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:33,000
it was created in La Guajira and spread to the south

533
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:37,125
It reached Valledupar
and in Valledupar, vallenato music was created

534
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:40,125
because it was originally played with a guitar, and then the accordion was introduced

535
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:43,333
because it is a music, practically

536
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:46,875
we can say it's indigenous
because the tambora drum

537
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:50,333
comes from Africa, from the African or Afro people

538
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:54,916
and the guacharaca is also indigenous
because it comes from the Sierra Nevada.

539
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,750
Really? Well, it's interesting that here on the peninsula

540
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:01,541
a lot has been influenced by the Wayuu, from what I've read and heard.

541
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:05,708
Well, there have been exchanges

542
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:08,708
between different cultural elements

543
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:12,416
from all around the Caribbean, Mexico, North America.

544
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:15,916
Yes, of course.

545
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:18,458
A point of

546
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:19,166
exchange.

547
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:21,250
Of course, that's why there's so much mixing.

548
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:25,333
My grandfather was Dutch, because he passed away.

549
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:27,458
That's why my last name is Prince.

550
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:28,333
That's what my grandfather said,

551
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:32,125
my father, that when the ships arrived
on the coastal shore,

552
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:36,708
in Puerto López, he arrived and fell in love with my grandmother.

553
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,208
They lived on Carrizal beach, where we will go tomorrow,

554
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:43,750
That's why that territory belongs to my father, but my own territory

555
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:48,083
of the clan is around here, in the border area,
but I have rights because my dad was from there.

556
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:53,166
And we always lived off
the traditional economy of the beach, which is fishing.

557
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:55,208
And that's because we have the sea,

558
00:39:55,208 --> 00:40:00,708
we are "apalanchi" in our language,
"apalanchi" are people who have the sea.

559
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,458
Well

560
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:08,416
I have a question

561
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:10,708
I would like to know

562
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,375
if men are the ones who

563
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:17,083
make the music,
what role do women have, what is their role?

564
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,083
So beyond receiving the music,

565
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:23,083
what role do they have?

566
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:24,041
Well,

567
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:26,416
women also play instruments

568
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:29,166
there's an instrument that is played with the hand
but it's played by girls,

569
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:32,666
not by older women, it's the wawai and the iruwai made from a small tree

570
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:35,125
I don't have it here, but maybe they have it over there with the kids

571
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:38,625
The kids can play that instrument,
most of the girls play it

572
00:40:39,416 --> 00:40:42,166
And also, as I mentioned before, for us,
it's very important for a woman
to be able to make music and those who sing "jayechi"

573
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:47,000
in their "jayechi," they sing anecdotes

574
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:51,583
of their history, of themselves,

575
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:56,000
of what they experience, sadness or sorrow.

576
00:40:56,916 --> 00:41:00,125
Yes, like a song where they compose the music themselves.

577
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,958
Yes, very important. Women also make music,

578
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,666
but here, it depends on the fundamental work

579
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:09,666
they do because in Wayuu culture,
we have a normative system

580
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:15,083
a plan where each person has their fundamental occupation,
the woman has her fundamental occupation

581
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:19,708
and the man also has his fundamental occupation,
that's why we always maintain the Wayuu culture

582
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:23,125
and preserve cultural expressions through

583
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:26,125
the social organization we have.

584
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:28,791
What is the occupation of each one?

585
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:31,208
What is the occupation of both women and men?

586
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:33,541
Well, the occupation of women is diverse.

587
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:35,166
There are women Outsü (spiritual guide)

588
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:38,166
there are women Oulaküt (visionary)

589
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:41,250
there are women einülü (craftswoman)

590
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:45,500
and women eikülü (educator) and atükalü (ceramist)

591
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,125
These are the five fundamental occupations of Wayuu women

592
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:51,166
and for men, there's the pütchipüi (speaker)

593
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:55,416
the Wayuu alaüla, who is

594
00:41:56,791 --> 00:42:00,416
the maternal uncle, Wayuu ekirajasu (teacher)

595
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:04,541
sunai tu wakuwaipakat (our culture), that's how it would be seen,

596
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:07,583
look, I have my hand here,

597
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:11,500
This one here is the grandmother, and this is the mother

598
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:14,041
and this one

599
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:17,208
is the maternal uncle, and this one is the child,

600
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:21,916
so to make my instrument, I have to grasp it

601
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:26,458
from my grandmother, my mother, in order to grasp the knife
and they teach me how to make the instrument.

602
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:29,458
The woman is always present in the worldview

603
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:33,791
and here too, mom is here,

604
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:37,416
oushi (grandmother), tatushi (my maternal uncle)

605
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:41,000
because the achon (son)

606
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,500
the achon here no longer has a clan,

607
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,500
he is here, holding it, and I make the instrument in this way

608
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:49,541
when I hold the reed, look, there it is

609
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:52,541
holding the mother, oushi

610
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:55,291
Grandmother and mother

611
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:57,958
the Wayuu woman is always there

612
00:42:57,958 --> 00:43:01,000
and the maternal uncle here in the middle,

613
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:04,291
this is the maternal uncle,

614
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:07,958
he is the one who exercises authority, who enforces

615
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:11,583
behavior within the community

616
00:43:12,541 --> 00:43:14,041
there they are.

617
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:17,041
We are always five, five manifestations

618
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:17,958
which are

619
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:25,291
mother tongue, spirituality,

620
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:29,375
territory, social organization, and traditional economy.

621
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:32,166
There are the five on the finger

622
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:34,708
and there are also the five.

623
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:37,125
Grandmother

624
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:40,083
What is this one? Mother, maternal uncle,

625
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:44,166
the grandson, and achon (son)

626
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:48,250
There are the five, and that is

627
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,208
they are always part of the organization,
the woman is always present

628
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:55,291
That's why it's called

629
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:57,708
"eei" which means mother.

630
00:43:57,708 --> 00:44:01,208
Eei.

631
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:03,083
Thank you.

632
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,708
Well, if you had a message

633
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:09,083
that you would like to share with the world, what would it be?

634
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:12,416
The message would be

635
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:17,833
well, these days we had the visit
of the president, it was quite hard for us,

636
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:20,083
it was a good visit

637
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:23,958
and what the president said about us,

638
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:29,500
about what he said

639
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:32,833
about us.

640
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:35,791
I have always said one thing,

641
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,916
life is sacred,

642
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:42,791
life to make music is sacred, and life for us

643
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:45,750
is very important,

644
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,708
because when we die, we go to another life,

645
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:54,166
we are not dead, that's why they hold wakes for us
and when our remains are exhumed

646
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:57,708
they say that we are still alive and still here on earth,

647
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:03,875
I mean, as I said at the beginning, we don't go
even to the right hand of God, we don't go to hell,

648
00:45:04,458 --> 00:45:08,458
instead, we have a long journey,
and that long journey is the message

649
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:11,916
that I bring to the Wayuu community and to the whole world.

650
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:15,041
to make them aware that

651
00:45:15,041 --> 00:45:18,041
in the department of La Guajira, there is an indigenous people

652
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:21,083
that has its own music,

653
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:24,000
that has spirituality, has principles,

654
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,958
values to maintain the music
and harmony of the Wayuu people.

655
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,500
That's the message I can bring, and for them to know

656
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:35,041
the music, to listen to the "sawawa,"

657
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:36,750
the sonorous music

658
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,750
of our Wayuu instruments.

659
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:43,625
And to confirm that everything you've said

660
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:48,000
we have knowledge to use it in the documentary
and the music as well.

661
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:49,208
Do you allow it? I mean,

662
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:52,208
Would you allow us to use your music

663
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:56,166
or what you played
to be part of this project we are working on?

664
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,291
Well, yes, I can do that, but we

665
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:03,291
are protective in the sense that

666
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,333
it is for a good purpose

667
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:09,333
not just for you but also for us,

668
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:13,416
because you are taking a legacy
it's not something trivial

669
00:46:13,416 --> 00:46:16,875
because this is not something you can find in a music store,

670
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:20,208
like a guitar, like a trumpet, you can't find

671
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:23,833
any of these instruments or the Kasha.

672
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:26,833
It's an effort that we make to manufacture
and create it.

673
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:32,416
No, not to make it for the need to sell,
but a necessity that we have as a people.

674
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:35,791
Wayuu to maintain and preserve our cultural expressions

675
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:38,791
through our spirituality.

676
00:46:38,791 --> 00:46:41,791
So, if people see a picture of Saüyepia (the school)

677
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:45,875
or maybe of me on social media and they are promoting it,

678
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,250
they might think that I am

679
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:51,416
selling, that I have money, and since I live here,

680
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:56,541
these chairs, these benches are for the girls
and boys who come to listen to the music,

681
00:46:57,083 --> 00:47:00,625
this piece of zinc that you see there with holes,
is where we make the music.

682
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,125
Not long ago, we won some money
and when the president came, we had those looms made

683
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:10,583
so that the women and girls can make the "siira"
(men's sash) with the threads, and that was earned

684
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:13,625
because someone came to give something to us.

685
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:18,458
And we are going to Bogotá
to perform in the first week of August,

686
00:47:18,958 --> 00:47:22,291
we will spend a week there
a large group from Saüyepia, from the school

687
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:26,208
to showcase the music and the dance expression.

688
00:47:26,208 --> 00:47:31,041
We are going to a gathering of indigenous peoples
and we are the ones representing La Guajira, the Wayuu people

689
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:32,333
it's us from the school

690
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:37,250
we will be there in the first week of August

691
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:41,083
I will go with my group,
more than 15 girls here, between boys and girls

692
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:44,750
and then I'll go alone on the 22nd

693
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:46,333
until the 26th.

694
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:49,333
That will be from August 6th to 13th at the Teatro Colón,

695
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:54,166
we will perform at the Teatro Colón

696
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:57,333
and at the Centro Nacional de Arte, the Nuevo Teatro.

697
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,583
Maestro Iván Benavides,

698
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:02,666
who is the director

699
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:04,708
in Bogotá.

700
00:48:04,708 --> 00:48:07,708
From the sixth to the thirteenth of August.

701
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,541
And then I come back again.

702
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:12,750
I come with my big group,
and then I go alone with another person,

703
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,500
I perform at the university, I think it's the Javeriana.

704
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:20,083
From the 23rd to the 27th of the same month.

705
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:23,833
So that's what I'm saying,
what we want is,

706
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:28,333
maybe as a donation,
it's not for me, it's for all of us,

707
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:32,375
that's how we sustain ourselves,

708
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:37,333
and look for the materials because we can't find them here,

709
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:41,875
we have to search for them in the Sierra de la Macuira
or in the Sierra Nevada,

710
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:46,291
where the Wiwa people are, who lend us their territory,
and I have to ask for permission to gather the

711
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:50,791
materials to maintain more instruments
and do everything

712
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,291
with the children of the school.

713
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:57,291
Yes, tomorrow we have an activity

714
00:48:57,708 --> 00:49:00,708
I'm inviting you because it's a community

715
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:05,416
where they are going to hold an event, a harmonization ritual,
and they invite us to participate.

716
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:08,666
I will talk to the people,
I'll tell them you're coming

717
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:13,958
I know they won't say no, so you can come with us,
and maybe you can record a video or interview us,

718
00:49:13,958 --> 00:49:18,208
which also helps us to sustain ourselves.

719
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:18,666
the

720
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:23,041
the school, you know.

721
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:25,541
If what we don't want is that

722
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:27,875
because it has happened to us
not only with people

723
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:32,166
like you but also with people from here in La Guajira
who sometimes take our material and publish it.

724
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:35,166
At least it happened during the pandemic
they took images

725
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:39,833
from a video we made, for a festival in Uribia,
but there was no festival

726
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,500
and the authorities took it
took it and published it during the pandemic

727
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,500
and all the mothers called me because I hadn't seen
that the girls were in the publication

728
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:51,416
and I called, I sent a formal request to the governor, and immediately
they took it down from the networks

729
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,583
and I left it at that because I wanted to, I didn't want to,
I didn't want to sue them for copyright either

730
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,041
because they didn't have permission to publish that

731
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:03,000
and they were selling that as material.

732
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,291
And that's because we really didn't give
any permission, and it has happened to us several times

733
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:10,125
with images of us
because, honestly, and it's not to tell a lie

734
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:13,666
The only school that exists

735
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:16,666
with Wayuu characteristics is us.

736
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:21,416
And here in La Guajira
there are more than 600 cultural foundations

737
00:50:21,916 --> 00:50:24,708
We are a cultural foundation through the school

738
00:50:24,708 --> 00:50:27,791
and we are the only ones with cultural character
it's us

739
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:33,083
and we showed it to the Ministry of Culture
when the president came.

740
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:35,208
we

741
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:39,208
we met with the Minister of Culture and the Vice Minister

742
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:42,541
they sat down with the entire Ministry's leadership,

743
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:46,125
Population, Heritage, with us

744
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:49,708
and they didn't let anyone else in

745
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:52,833
because many people wanted to enter,

746
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:57,250
here at the Mayor's Office, and they said no,
we are only going to have the meeting with Saüyepia with you from the school,

747
00:50:58,416 --> 00:50:59,666
So that was just for us.

748
00:50:59,666 --> 00:51:04,583
They took an impression of us
asked, "How do you live? Why do you do this?"

749
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:07,208
"What time have you been working with culture?"

750
00:51:07,208 --> 00:51:08,916
We told them everything.

751
00:51:08,916 --> 00:51:13,666
Firstly, the truth is that we do not have support
from the municipality or the department, we live on what

752
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,750
suddenly comes, people like you who visit us and bring us

753
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:20,541
that's how we live and from politicians

754
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:23,666
that sometimes give us coats, shoes when we go to Bogota

755
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:28,291
so we live from donations.

756
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:31,291
We work with cooperation

757
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:35,583
we have some allies,
a school just like this one, but for African drums
we have

758
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:39,250
and I have drums in there that have been given to us,
they are a school of drums

759
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:43,625
in La Boquilla, Cartagena, which are Afro drums.

760
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:47,958
and we have a project called School
of Knowledge of Cultural Rights.

761
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,500
With them, we create a cultural life plan

762
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:56,083
to maintain and preserve everything cultural.

763
00:51:57,666 --> 00:51:57,916
That's why I'm telling you

764
00:51:57,916 --> 00:52:01,041
I told my friend that not just anyone

765
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:04,625
we let in, only those who do this,

766
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:07,625
Yes, yes, because it has value,

767
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:13,250
not just money, but cultural value,
the value it has as a people

768
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:16,250
which is ancient, what we have.

769
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:19,166
Well, then we'll keep in touch,

770
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:23,000
We collaborate, and before publishing anything, first

771
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:27,541
Of course, with our name,
the address of a school here in La Guajira,

772
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:31,125
of course, exactly with our name

773
00:52:31,291 --> 00:52:33,333
and yes, look

774
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:37,458
I'm also going to give you a photo

775
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:39,833
and a thousand more.

776
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:42,791
That's it,

777
00:52:42,791 --> 00:52:45,541
what I'm up to.

778
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:48,583
You don't have to

779
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:55,375
do.

780
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:02,250
It's good to start with the introduction and

781
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:05,250
Well,
it's a photo that I'm going to give you, a Polaroid.

782
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,666
I don't know if you've seen it, but it shows...

783
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:12,666
But before we do that,

784
00:53:12,666 --> 00:53:16,000
Can you say it again

785
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Just so we make sure that

786
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:21,958
Of course, where are we now?

787
00:53:21,958 --> 00:53:22,541
The school.

788
00:53:22,541 --> 00:53:25,750
And I say that in Wayuunaiki is fine too.

789
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:29,166
What do I have to say?

790
00:53:29,166 --> 00:53:31,000
Just your name.

791
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And that you authorize in the school.

792
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,250
In the school

793
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:38,875
which is what it's called here

794
00:53:38,875 --> 00:53:43,500
My name is such, we are in your school
in Uribia

795
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:47,541
The date, and we are sharing a bit
of our knowledge.

796
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:50,833
Okay? Music, okay.

797
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:52,375
Got it.

798
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:55,000
Well, my name is Joaquín Prince

799
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,250
from the Eirüku Jayariyu, and we are here

800
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:04,833
at the traditional school "Semillero Wayuu," Saüyepia Wayuu,

and sharing with you

801
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:07,916
the cultural richness through music, through

802
00:54:07,916 --> 00:54:10,958
the spirituality of our community.

803
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,958
Well, thank you for this visit

804
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:18,416
It's very good that you come, get to know
all this cultural legacy that we have.

805
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:21,500
As you can see, this is the space we have

806
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:25,208
this is a sacred space for us,

807
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:28,208
because here we maintain all the richness with spirituality

808
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:31,416
of the Master Jorge Enrique,
who passed away, leaving us this legacy.

809
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:34,875
And we want you to know it as well,

810
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:37,875
that you take it far and get to know the school

811
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:42,375
that from where Colombia begins,
there is a school that is strengthening

812
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:45,666
and preserving the richness of Wayuu music.
