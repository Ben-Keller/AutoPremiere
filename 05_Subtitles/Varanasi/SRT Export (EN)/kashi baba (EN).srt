1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,375
baba: discussing something to someone else

2
00:00:06,916 --> 00:00:07,750
baba: har har

3
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,125
yes, Mahadev

4
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,333
interviewer: Baba, Namaskar

5
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,083
Baba: Namaskar, brother.

6
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:24,375
interviewer: please tell us something about yourself in a brief introduction that what is your name...

7
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:25,708
baba: my name is Kashi Baba

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,250
interviewer: we will
talk in Hindi Baba: Ok

9
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:33,625
Baba: My name is Kashi Baba, I live in Manikarnika Maha Shamshan (cemetery) and that is my job.

10
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:43,500
people who comes to me, I explain all the things related to this place about what happens here and why it happens and that this place is known as Manikarnika Maha Shamshan (cemetery)

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,750
People come here to attain salvation, but only one who has done his karma attains salvation.

12
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:56,541
Interviewer: What is the meaning of salvation
baba:This is a great crematorium, karma is worshiped here.

13
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:01,375
If the karma is not pure then will one attain salvation? Where will it come from?

14
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:07,791
Karma is the most important thing in this crematorium.

15
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:17,083
If the karma is not pure, then how can one attain salvation, it has to come and go again.

16
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,541
have to wander in the births and deaths

17
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:27,416
Interviewer: Brother, please calm down for two minutes, I have to take a small interview, just for two minutes.

18
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:30,083
Baba: you can go from here

19
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:34,000
Interviewer: You were telling about karma, how should we do karma?

20
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,541
baba: Means keep the soul pure

21
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:43,791
This karma is born from here, not from Maya and material.

22
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:52,333
To keep our karma pure, we have to do good deeds, and the more good deeds we do, the more results we will get.

23
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,250
Interviewer: But people keep running after Maya.

24
00:01:54,291 --> 00:02:04,000
baba: Maya is because it is an illusion, it will get heavier, and as it gets heavier, the more the effect of Kaliyuga will fall on it.

25
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:14,541
That is why four eras have been created - Satyayuga, Dwaparayuga, Tretayuga, Kaliyuga, why were they created, that is why you can wander in them.

26
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:27,666
Gave 94 to you, kept 6 with himself, why he kept 6?  so that you remain lost in it

27
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:38,208
And the one who attains those 6 attains salvation, but not everyone attains those 6.

28
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:46,958
One has to enter inside it, one has to meet the soul and God.

29
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,958
Interviewer: But the illusion pulls us towards itself.

30
00:02:50,333 --> 00:03:00,958
baba: That is why the mind is fickle, why the mind has been created, the mind is fickle, just like a monkey, it wanders, jumps and jumps, just like this the mind is fickle.

31
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:07,750
The mind also runs, so both the mind and Maya are the same, it pulls towards itself.

32
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:15,208
But to control it, we have to struggle with it, we have to fight with it.

33
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:19,375
Even if he goes somewhere and overcomes it, he does not get everything.

34
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:26,541
Interviewer: Baba,like this is Hindu religion, what is the specialty of Banaras in this Hindu religion?

35
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:35,166
baba: Whatever is in Banaras is juice, everything is juice here, that is why it is called Banaras.

36
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:42,125
When Lord Shankar came here, when Lord Vishnu came here, they did penance here for 60 thousand years.

37
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,083
60 thousand years

38
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:54,041
And with his Chakra he created that Chakrapushkarni, Manikarnika Kund, and that Kund is filled with the sweat of Lord Vishnu.

39
00:03:55,208 --> 00:04:03,375
So when Mother Parvati and Lord Shankar came for a visit, they saw that there was a pond here, but there was nothing in it.

40
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:13,416
So when Lord Shankar and Mother Parvati go to meditate, then Lord Shankar's gem falls, and along with it the earring of Mother Parvati also fell.

41
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:26,041
When they started searching and did not find it, then Lord Vishnu says, it is cursed, keep something here which will make a big place in the belief of Hindu religion.

42
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:33,916
Which is the biggest pilgrimage site among the pilgrimage sites, then Lord Shankar named it Manikarnika Ghat.

43
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:41,458
Mani-Karnika and Ghat, then the name of Chakrapushkarni changed to Manikarnika.

44
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,875
So whenever any pilgrimage site comes here, the biggest pilgrimage is Manikarnika.

45
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:52,375
Interviewer: It is said that Manikarnika is the biggest pilgrimage center of India.
Baba: Yes, the pilgrimage among pilgrimages.

46
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,291
Interviewer: Because salvation is attained here

47
00:04:56,666 --> 00:05:06,916
baba: People come here for religious activities, that is why people perform body rites, people who come here to die.

48
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,541
to attain salvation

49
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:21,416
But what about many people that they have come here to die, and are lying in old age ashram, Moksh Bhawan or Mukti Bhawan, but it is not written there that they have to die in Kashi.

50
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:30,791
This is because if their soul is not pure, then how will they attain salvation?  Where will one attain salvation?

51
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:40,666
From here people go somewhere else, it was found out that after going there and leaving the body, it was not written  that you will get salvation in Kashi.

52
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:52,375
Interviewer: Living people come here to attain salvation.  Tell us about how important it is to attain salvation in Hindu religion and people want to spend their last days in Banaras and die here only.

53
00:05:52,500 --> 00:06:02,791
baba: But not everyone can come, people come, those who believe, those who know that we will attain salvation in Kashi.

54
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:13,541
So people come here from all over, some are in Mukti Bhawan, some are in Moksh Bhawan, some are in Sadhu Bela Ashram, there are many ashrams built like this.

55
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,083
People come, months, fifteen days, twenty days, thinking that now it is our last time, let's go to Kashi.

56
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:33,458
But if it is not written here, then they get worried for two months and think that it is not written for them, take them somewhere else, then they come to know that after picking them up from Kashi, they took them somewhere else, and there their soul left their body.

57
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,625
So it is also written in Kashi

58
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,416
Interviewer: Only the one who has purity of mind

59
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:50,291
baba: Not everyone is written in Kashi, if you keep the whole world in Kashi, then only he whose death is written will remain, the person living in Kashi goes and dies in a foreign country.

60
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:59,750
Why?  Because its name is not written in Kashi, Manikarnika pilgrimage site is not for everyone.

61
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,958
Those who are very lucky people, for them there is Manikarnika, the great crematorium of Kashi.

62
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,333
Interviewer: What is this process?

63
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:14,083
baba: This process has been going on for centuries, since ancient times.

64
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:27,333
When 51 body parts of Mata Sati fell at 51 different places, all of them are Shaktipeeths, which are called Disha Lakshi.

65
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:35,583
He is in the Manikarnika pilgrimage site, today he has become Meera ghat, but this entire pilgrimage is Manikarnika.

66
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:42,583
This is an entire area from Meera ghat to Manikarnika and this is the entire Manikarnika.

67
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:48,625
So the kings and emperors made something out of something, some made meera ghat, some made a pilgrimage ghat, some made a maan temple.

68
00:07:49,625 --> 00:08:00,458
But the area of ​​Manikarnika, you are seeing Scindia Ghat, Dattatreya, Mir Ghat, you are seeing the temple of Brahimdevi, this is the entire area of ​​Manikarnika.

69
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:17,750
Interviewer: Baba, when our soul attains salvation and leaves the body, then what is the time of life after that, what is that life?

70
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:27,416
baba: This is explained by one's deeds, however, this soul never dies.

71
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:35,000
This soul never dies, it leaves one body and attains another body immediately.

72
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,291
interviewer: how

73
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:43,750
baba: As soon as we leave our body, the soul appears in someone else's body.

74
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:58,250
Just like someone became pregnant at the same time, took birth immediately, even if you give it a different name, it doesn't matter, but the body is the same, only the name is different.

75
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:07,625
So the soul never dies, the soul leaves one body and immediately joins another body, then those who attain salvation

76
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:11,916
that is the only body that goes to Lord Vishnu

77
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,000
Attainment of salvation comes directly from Lord Vishnu.

78
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:27,333
Interviewer: Baba, how should we live the normal life that has been taught in Hindu religion?  We are not talking about the life of a saint.

79
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:39,708
baba: It is not necessary, a saint may be a great saint, but unless he is pure in soul, he is not a saint.

80
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,041
they are only for fun

81
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:51,333
So you can become a Sadhu, it is not necessary, there is no ashram greater than the Grihasthi Ashram of living within a family.

82
00:09:52,208 --> 00:10:03,875
While living in a household, seeing all the things, seeing all the actions, how they should run, how they should run, if you move along observing everything, then your life will always be truthful.

83
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,166
And karma will always be pure

84
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,375
come this way

85
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:15,458
So for this it is not necessary that one has to disguise himself and become a saint.

86
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:28,166
We also live in a householder's ashram, we too are householders, it is not necessary that we become saints and show illusion here and there or that we are after collecting illusion only

87
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:33,125
Interviewer: What is the process of becoming a Sadhu, who can become a Sadhu?

88
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:40,500
baba: A saint has to give up illusion, material things, home and family.

89
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:50,250
And after renouncing whatever is there, you go to some forest, doing penance, you have no connection with anyone, there is no Maya.

90
00:10:52,583 --> 00:11:02,583
So not everyone is able to do it, the first course is of 12 years, which is called Hat Tapasya.

91
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:12,416
One who is an ascetic will do severe penance for the first 12 years and then after going somewhere he will get one anna.

92
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,208
Second course is 24 years

93
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,208
Third course is 42 years

94
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,166
So who does it?

95
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,833
Satguru are such people

96
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:36,708
There was Swami Shankaracharya ji, there was Vivekananda ji, there are such people who used to do all this.

97
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:43,833
Now all the saints are there just for money, just keep coming.

98
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:48,291
You have sounded the trumpet, you have sounded the boat, keep moving.

99
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:54,791
So Sadhu's name is devil, Baba's name is chaos.

100
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:03,250
So one should not do such deeds, if one has become a saint then one should also have the thoughts of a saint.

101
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:06,291
Interviewer: But how do one become a saint?  They also have to go to their own last rites

102
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:15,875
baba: One has to sacrifice oneself completely, those sanskars, tenth, thirteenth, all are done immediately, they will be bald.

103
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:23,875
And those who have, their gurus speak in their ears, those mantras are not told to everyone, only they can do that mantra.

104
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:33,375
The knowledge that the Guru has given, the mantra that the Guru has given, that mantra is not told to anyone, it is the knowledge of the Guru.

105
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:40,375
Now some do one guru, some do five gurus, some do eleven gurus.

106
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:48,875
But when there is a Guru's work then only one is made a Guru, till now I have not made anyone a Guru, I have not found anyone like that.

107
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:54,125
Still the Guru is searching for us, and we are still searching for the Guru

108
00:12:55,833 --> 00:13:00,583
It is not necessary that we are searching with the body, we are searching with the eyes, we are searching from here

109
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,625
Interviewer: What is your age?
baba: My, at this time it is 55 years

110
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,291
Interviewer: You have been searching for your guru for 55 years.

111
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:17,000
baba: Where have we not gone, we have visited Uttarakhand, Kedarnath, Badrinath, Amarnath, Amarkantha, Kailash and everywhere else, but till now we have not found any Guru.

112
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,083
Will see when we get it

113
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:30,791
This is that we are searching for the Guru, the Guru is searching for us, and no one knows where we will find him, neither do I know nor do they know.

114
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,250
we meet many saints

115
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:43,541
I kept walking in Uttarakhand for seven months and twenty-eight days, on foot, and in this disguise.

116
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:49,041
Not in any other clothes or anything, in the same disguise as we are here.

117
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:56,083
I have gone till Shillong, I have gone till Brahmakamal

118
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,583
At that time I found 5365 sadhus

119
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,208
abbot people

120
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:09,083
But among them I understood only three people, that three are right and the rest are useless.

121
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,041
Interviewer: How did you shortlist these guys?

122
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,666
We have seen them, we just sit while talking.

123
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:22,458
Wherever satsang is going on, sadhus are sitting there, we also sit in the middle, listening.

124
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,500
I asked anyone, whatever my soul said and I did not get the right answer.

125
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:42,541
Later I saw that he was lying somewhere after drinking alcohol, someone was lying here after consuming cannabis and was saying that you give us something, I will order this, I will order that.

126
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:43,625
so what is all this

127
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:51,750
We found such and such people, but I found three saints, who were a little good, and even those were not complete.

128
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:58,500
Means the one with half paisa, the same form of 12 year old that was mentioned in the beginning.

129
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:09,208
Look, in front of us was an indifferent Indradev, he was doing penance for 12 years at the doorstep of Vishwanath temple in Uttarkashi.

130
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:20,250
From 12 years, only one day was left, just 12 hours and in 12 hours his 12 years of penance was broken

131
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,750
He was fascinated by a girl

132
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:33,250
Maya got into his head, she was a girl from Germany, he got fascinated, he married her.

133
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:42,916
After a week she returned from Germany after selling her entire property,

134
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:48,250
And the moment he saw that Maya had taken over his head, he killed her, tied her in a bundle and threw her in the Ganga.

135
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,166
so there are such saints

136
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:05,625
We came face to face with him, where the sages live, where ever the place is set, there is smoke and the smoke should keep burning for 24 hours.

137
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:11,500
If one belongs to Naga sect then the incense stick should be kept burning for 24 hours.

138
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:17,125
We saw that the smoke was cold, we said Maharaj, tell us one thing.

139
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:27,791
Your age is around 50-62. He said yes, I said how long have you been a saint?  They said it's been 42 years for me

140
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:35,333
And  have done penance for 12 years, I said ok you have done penance for 12 years but for how many days has this ashram been your hut?

141
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:42,458
He said that the hut has been there for 22 years, I said why is it so cold?

142
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:52,875
Then he started looking up and down, must have thought that he has asked something very high.

143
00:16:53,666 --> 00:17:02,083
I said, Maharaj, from where you became a saint, I said, I am the guru of that Akhara, I am from Khadakhara Akhara.

144
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,250
Find where is Khadakhada Akhara

145
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,791
search search worldwide

146
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,250
nothing will be found

147
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:23,541
And later when he got worried, he started asking, Maharaj, where is this Kharakha Akhara?

148
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:34,208
We said, this is a cremation ground, this is a crematorium, Harishchandra was sitting in the ghat and said, look, this is a ghat, it runs 24 hours, this is a crematorium, you are blind.

149
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,625
You have not opened the eyes here, you have just kept this one open.

150
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,375
from which only illusion is visible

151
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,541
only illusion is visible

152
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:53,791
The truth is not visible, and it is a permanent arena that runs 24 hours a day.

153
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,333
I belong to that arena

154
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:06,000
He started looking at me from top to bottom, I said go have fun, go, ask, eat and have fun but don't fool me.

155
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,875
Interviewer: Baba, there are some sadhus who worship dead bodies. What is the difference between them and sadhus?

156
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,375
baba: Now they are Aghori, those who are Aghori are Kapalik.

157
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:28,083
Those who are Kapalikas worship the dead and awaken them.

158
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:28,833
interviewer: why

159
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:34,916
baba: For some Tantra Vidya, which is called magic power, black magic.

160
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:45,375
Like I embezzled something of yours and gave it to them, embezzled theirs and gave it to them, embezzled theirs and gave it to them, so what is all this black magic?

161
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,583
exorcising, soaking, burdening, burdensome work

162
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:57,500
So this used to be their job but not everyone does it, some are such wise that they follow the truth.

163
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:05,333
But here it is mostly untrue, the truth is not visible, it just dominates.

164
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,166
Interviewer: Is it all a pretense?

165
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,375
baba: Yes, Keenaram was a person

166
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,791
His last generation was Yavdutram

167
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:26,000
If Yavdutram had followed the rules then this yavdutram would have been the 21st generation of Keenaram.

168
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,708
Interviewer: Can an Aghori hurt anyone?
baba: yes

169
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:35,500
Interviewer: What would be the motive of Aghori, what would be his aim to hurt someone?

170
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:43,125
baba: It is like that if someone has done such a deed to him then he can hurt him, that too through his Tantra Kriya.

171
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,875
whatever he says will happen

172
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,791
Interviewer: They have so much power

173
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:56,291
baba: But not everyone, maybe one in a million is like this.

174
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,666
Interviewer: How different are they from saints?

175
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,541
These people live 10 miles apart from the saints, 10 miles

176
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:15,958
Because Avaguni Tantra is the 44th part of Lord Shankar.

177
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,666
Like Lord Shankar always stays in the crematorium

178
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:28,750
The 44th part is Aghor Tantra, not everyone does that.

179
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:36,750
There are 44 types of Aghoris also.

180
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:48,083
Some people perform the cremation rituals, some people perform the rituals while sitting in the graveyard, some people perform the rituals while sitting in water, all the rituals are of the crematorium only.

181
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,458
So these are the three ways

182
00:20:55,125 --> 00:21:00,083
The fourth one is where people are buried in the cemetery.

183
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,333
So all these are the same rituals of cremation but all are different.

184
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,916
Everyone's work is divided that you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this

185
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:13,250
Interviewer: Whom do these Aghori worship?

186
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:23,833
baba: Worship Mahakaal, worship Kali, worship Mahakali, that's it, nothing else, worship skeleton Kali.

187
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:39,666
Interviewer: Baba, now let's finish, you too must be tired, but I will just ask one question on Mother Ganga and a small message
that you want to send to the world.  What is the relevance of Mother Ganga here in Banaras and what is its belief in Hindu religion?

188
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,291
baba: This is Uttarayani Ganga in Kashi, Uttarayani Ganga which is in Kashi is very important.

189
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:55,000
This is not everywhere, that's why people come to Kashi, to take bath in Uttarayani Ganga.

190
00:21:55,166 --> 00:22:04,416
And to have darshan of Lord Shankar, that is why people take bath in Kashi and have darshan of Vishwanath, Baba Mrityunjaynath is present here.

191
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:15,541
And Kaal Bhairav ​​is the Kotwal of Kashi, the protector of Ganga and the protector of Vishwanath, so after having darshan of all, Kaal Bhairav ​​is seen.

192
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,041
This is the importance of Kashi

193
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:24,916
Interviewer: Baba, if we look with our naked eyes, we have polluted Mother Ganga a lot but still people come.

194
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,708
baba: All these people see it with the mind's eye

195
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:36,666
We see with our mind's eye that Ganga is polluted.

196
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:41,375
Who has the power to pollute the Ganga?

197
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:49,166
Who has the power?  Ganga is flowing

198
00:22:51,250 --> 00:23:02,708
And the water that flows never gets polluted, even today keep Ganga water in one bottle and water from somewhere else in the other bottle.

199
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:09,958
Be it Yamuna, Mandakini, Godavari, or any other water, collect water from a tap and keep it.

200
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:16,583
collect water from a well anywhere

201
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:22,958
You will find bacteria in it but bacteria are still not found in the water of Ganga.

202
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:31,500
Even now, bacteria are not found in the water of Ganga, but if you see it with your mind's eye, it is polluted.

203
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:40,125
Look with the eyes here, open your third eye, then you will understand whether Ganga is there.

204
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:47,125
People are cleaning the filth of the world in the Ganga.

205
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:56,791
The filth of the world is being cleaned in the Ganga and who is born to pollute the Ganga?

206
00:23:56,916 --> 00:24:11,666
Interviewer: Baba, just one last question, if you want to give any message to people about how to live, or want to say something about Hindu religion because the whole world will listen to you, then you have to give any message about how to  Live by or do something?

207
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:21,125
baba: Keep your karma pure, you will always be happy, live anywhere in the world and if it is pure

208
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:30,375
So there will development and only development everywhere, and if it is dirty you will not find clean anywhere

209
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,250
it is my opinion

210
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:44,416
Live in Manikarnika Mahashamshan, Burning for Learning Cremation for Education, here people come to learn a life of education, because this is a spiritual place only one in the world

211
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,125
for the Hindu religion, to burn and to die here

212
00:24:50,541 --> 00:25:01,083
So when people come here after death they forget all the attachment, all the illusion all the materials, they look for reality needs to get into spirituality of this place

213
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:09,875
when people do meditation here, they know what does it mean by they will get it, what they want. Har Har Mahadev
