1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Silence

2
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,500
interview: Baba Namaste, Har Har Mahadev

3
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:12,666
Mahadev baba: Har Har Mahadev

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,375
Interview: Baba, will you introduce yourself a little, what is your name, where do you belong from, what work do you do?

5
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,625
baba: Yes, my name is Pradeep Puri.

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,333
We have been Naga Sadhus for 14 years

7
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:31,416
And I was born in Haryana, Rohtak district

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,958
interview: wait a second

9
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:50,208
phone rang and the interviewer speaks about some issue with something

10
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:54,875
How to become a saint?
You can share your experience

11
00:00:54,916 --> 00:01:01,291
baba: There is no point in
becoming a saint as some say.

12
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:06,791
Interview: Hey aunty, take it easy, take it easy, please give me two minutes of silence.

13
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:10,666
Yes

14
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:15,666
baba: So as if becoming a saint is not such a difficult task.

15
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:20,166
Sadhu is a sadhana

16
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:23,791
like meditating on god

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,125
to worship them

18
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:32,500
Sadhus perform puja according to rules and regulations

19
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:39,500
And as it has been 14 years since I became saint

20
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,000
I am a Naga saint

21
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,125
from Junakhada

22
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,083
Pradeep Puri is my name

23
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:48,125
Our Guruji's name is Raman Puri Ji Maharaj.

24
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,416
We belong to Haridwar

25
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,208
Our birth place is Haryana, Rohtak

26
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,416
we are in parikrama now

27
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,500
Interview: Take me to your early days, what did you do?

28
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,791
baba: We will tell you 14 years from today

29
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,791
we used to do readymade work

30
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,208
means private job

31
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,833
I have mother, father

32
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,333
and we are four brothers

33
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,166
I am the second one , I have one brother elder than me and two brothers younger than me.

34
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,708
He is also busy with his work

35
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,458
Interview: Tell us about everyone, who does what?  What does dad do?

36
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,000
Like dad is in gurgaon

37
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:42,083
Maruti is an agency company, a very old company of our country.

38
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:46,541
So my father has a small business there

39
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:51,000
like a sweet shop

40
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:58,125
And my younger brother also gets the work done by helping father.

41
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:03,833
And there is one brother younger than me, he is also in Gurgaon.

42
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:07,791
Like there is a bookshop, he works there

43
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:18,041
That is, family life is also good and life without family  is also good.

44
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:25,250
It depends on the person which life he chooses and which he does not choose.

45
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,250
Interview: Why did you choose this?

46
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:31,500
baba: I chose this because I am fond of listening to God's hymns since childhood.

47
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:41,666
To sit in the Aarti, to wake up on time in the morning, to meditate, to worship God, to offer obeisance to God in the morning, to light a lamp.

48
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:48,708
This is the work of a saint, means do not think that only a saint can do this work, a common man can also do this work.

49
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:56,791
What is the point of this, our religion, our tradition should remain forever.

50
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:02,875
And may we continue to call God face to face like this, and may our work continue to be successful like this.

51
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:13,541
I pray to God to do good to everyone, and  God also says, if you do good things then good things comes to you, his glory is limitless.

52
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:20,958
Now as we have come here to Kashi, we are enjoying a lot here.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,250
We are happy in our life and we have been here for at least two weeks now

54
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,875
We were having body problems since last three-four days.

55
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,750
We had fever so we took tablets and got injections.

56
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:43,708
And now I have come out of the fever a little, I am feeling a little better now.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,250
Interview: When you thought of becoming a saint at the age of 22, what was the attitude of your family?

58
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:55,958
Baba: What about the family members, as I tell you there is a tradition in our family.

59
00:04:56,708 --> 00:05:04,541
We follow the Jogi tradition, which means we are Joginath, both through our actions and through our religion.

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,750
So our uncle

61
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,958
We give him the status of father, right from childhood.

62
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,875
So he was more attached with me

63
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,958
And I also loved him more since childhood.

64
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:24,625
He used to get me up early in the morning and take bath

65
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,958
used to get me dressed with  clean and beautiful clothes

66
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:32,500
They used to say, let's go to the temple and light a lamp in front of God.

67
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:40,125
So I use to wake up with them in the morning at 6:30 am, 5:50 am, 6:00 am

68
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:44,666
After taking bath regularly, he used to go to the temple for prayer and worship.

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,750
So  we used to listen to Aarti Bhajans there, we used to get a different kind of peace in our mind.

70
00:05:52,666 --> 00:06:00,583
It means that there is a separate world, and everyone else is different from us, we are not like them.

71
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:08,875
As we sit in the Aarti, we start meditating, we concentrate on God.

72
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:19,500
There is so much joy in it, means that whatever work you do, you will get joy in it.

73
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:26,041
One who meditates, worships and worships God in the morning, makes the whole day blissful.

74
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:39,958
Interview: So tell us from the beginning what is the process of becoming a saint?  First step, second step, we have heard that to become a saint one has to donate one's own body?

75
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,500
Baba: Yes, the last rites are performed.

76
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,458
Interview: Tell me from the beginning, what is the first step when you take a decision for the first time?

77
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:50,166
baba: Yes, fourteen years ago we were in Haridwar.

78
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:56,875
So our uncle had given up his clothes.

79
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:04,833
So after that we talked to our family that we wanted to become saints.

80
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:10,250
So see, it is not so easy to become a saint.

81
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:15,541
Parents, siblings, uncles, maternal aunts

82
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:23,166
I don't know how many relatives there are who will know us or not, I don't know whether that time will come or not.

83
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:27,500
So we completely lost our attachment to those things.

84
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:35,791
As they say, we have given up attachment to everything - money, wealth, property.

85
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:41,708
So I am telling you, fourteen years ago our last rites were held in Haridwar, Har Ki Pauri.

86
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:51,291
So first of all when one becomes a saint, his last rites are performed.

87
00:07:52,166 --> 00:08:01,541
Last rites ​​like whether a person dies or whether he lives.

88
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:09,333
Meaning that it is the second birth of a saint, he is freed from his previous life.

89
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:15,333
A resolution is taken for  God, the resolution is made to take place

90
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:21,500
So in the resolution itself one renounces everything, that is, all attachment and attachment are left behind

91
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:30,416
Meaning, you should stick to one rule that you become God's child for every birth.

92
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,291
that is a saint

93
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:44,791
So there are 108 Pandits or those who are our great saints from whom these traditions are continuing and will continue.

94
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,833
So those saints are served with food

95
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:49,958
definitely

96
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,625
And they are honored with abundant Dakshina(donation)

97
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:04,666
So only after that one gets the robe of a saint.

98
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,958
Interview: How does it feel to donate one's own body?  Seeing your own funeral?

99
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,750
baba: See, this is just a feeling, what we think, what we understand.

100
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:27,791
But the feelings of a saint are different, he hardens his mind so much.

101
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:34,041
Like a stone lying in one place weighs more.

102
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:39,125
This means that a stone lying on one side is heavier.

103
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:49,666
Similarly, the mind of a saint is like that, that is, we make it so tough, so powerful.

104
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:54,791
That those saints do not get attracted or emotional after seeing anything

105
00:09:55,208 --> 00:10:03,166
They are attracted only by love and emotions, be it a devotee or a saint or any servant.

106
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:15,208
So as I told you, 108 Pandit Maharajs are served with food and given Dakshina (donation)

107
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:26,875
After that, Mundan (head shaving) takes place, meaning the head is shaved and the resolution is taken sitting on the banks of Ganga.

108
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:32,791
Our Guruji makes us take resolutions and Havan-Pooja, Path-Pooja, everything is done.

109
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,500
After that we are clothed in robes

110
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,833
And after wearing the chola, Guru's bell is given.

111
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:49,791
Which always reminds us, we are saints, our work and religion is different.

112
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,666
So this is how the life of a saint goes.

113
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,208
and saint in his life

114
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:09,458
At any time there is any sorrow, any problem, then the saint bears those things by remembering God through mantra.

115
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:19,416
And the duty of a saint is only one, to do good and not to do bad.

116
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:24,583
Like these days, these hypocrites have become saints.

117
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:31,833
They do not even know what the Guru Mantra is, that the Guru gives.

118
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,333
whatever they are practicing

119
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:42,583
Our Shiv Shankar, our Kali Mata, our Balaji Maharaj who is our Bajrangbali Ji.

120
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,333
So see, every guru has some mantra.

121
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:58,208
Be it of practice, or of meditation, or of distress, or of the wrath of some alien wind.

122
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,375
So the saint has a solution to every problem

123
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:10,041
so like his whole life

124
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:19,125
His life ends in his bhajans, meditation, whatever he is working on while travelling.

125
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:23,500
interview: inaudible due to background noise

126
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:33,541
Interview: Okay, leave all this and tell us about sacrifice, how difficult was it for you to sacrifice, how difficult was it to move away from attachment and things?

127
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:40,708
baba: Yes, it is not so, attachment is not a very powerful thing.

128
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:46,041
It's not like, humans think we can't live without it.

129
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:54,458
What does a human being need properly in the morning - food, tea, water

130
00:12:55,625 --> 00:13:01,291
What his body needs, that is what a saint needs, a human being needs.

131
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:09,166
If a person is not satisfied with food

132
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:14,291
So I don't know how many different routes he takes.

133
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,083
baba clearing his throat

134
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:24,250
According to me, I mean this is what I have seen

135
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:34,875
We have spent a lot of our parents' money, and we have also earned a lot of money.

136
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:42,125
means we still stayed away from all the attachments

137
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:49,791
Meaning in life, suppose we took 500 rupees from someone and told him that we will return it tomorrow.

138
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:55,875
That's an attachment, it's called attachment

139
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Which leads a person towards attachment, and then he is unable to come back to this side.

140
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:12,750
Our work is not like that, if we are taking money from someone then we pay it on time.

141
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,583
So we have no attachment to that thing

142
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:30,250
And see, it is nothing like that, my father also has a shop, I have my own plot, we have also built a nice house.

143
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,708
We were satisfied with everything in our life

144
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:43,791
But one night there came a time, I was sleeping and was in a very deep sleep

145
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:56,083
So as soon as I woke up, sweat appeared on My forehead, and I felt shivers all over my hands and feet.

146
00:14:56,583 --> 00:15:00,416
At that time it was around two or quarter past two.

147
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,958
I got scared, I was alone in my room

148
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:12,791
So I chanted Lord Shiva, I chanted the name Om.

149
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:25,208
And as we continued chanting, our problems became easier, as if our body was in some problem, in some pain, we did not know what overpowered us and what did not.

150
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:33,416
When we chanted Om name of Lord Shiv Shankar, gradually our body also got cured.

151
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:41,791
Our mind became clear, our meditation also became better, and our praise also became better.

152
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:50,916
So whenever I sit alone, I keep singing praises of God and chanting their name.

153
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:55,250
I use to keep chanting Om, this is the duty and religion of a saint.

154
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:03,708
nterviewer:And if we know about the deeds of a sadhu, then what is a real sadhu?

155
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:14,250
baba: A real saint is one who does not step back from his work and his religion.

156
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:22,583
Saint is one who gives knowledge

157
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:26,166
We do not consider the one who does not give knowledge as a saint.

158
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,833
nterviewer: How does a saint attain knowledge?

159
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:36,250
baba: See the attainment of knowledge is like..., our sadhana is also like when a child goes to school.

160
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:45,666
He learns there, first of all he is taught discipline there, like getting up and sitting down, yes no

161
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,375
So like this only, this is our rule, our tradition.

162
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:57,458
Like our mantras are in Sanskrit as well as in Hindi.

163
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,125
So

164
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:07,458
The saint keeps those mantras with him forever

165
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:12,375
So whenever a bad time comes

166
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,250
Someone comes to the saint having some trouble

167
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,833
Then the real saint will show him the right path and not the wrong one.

168
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,875
Neither is a saint attached to money, nor is he attached to anything.

169
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:34,750
Saint only does his duty and he will show that person the path which is good and not the wrong one

170
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:44,333
So the man tells him that Baba Ji, a ghost or an evil sprit resides inside him.

171
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:49,208
I have nightmares at night

172
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:54,833
So look, it's just a misconception

173
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:03,666
For which no medicine has been found till date, nor will it ever be found in my opinion.

174
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,708
It's all human confusion

175
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:18,041
Man thinks that this will happen to me right now, that will happen to me right now, but in reality nothing happens.

176
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:26,375
That is just a thought of a person, negative thoughts, means negative feelings.

177
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:34,041
Nothing like this happens in real life, but still we give him mantra.

178
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:42,083
Sankat Mantra is given that you should chant this mantra, no dilemma will dominate you after this.

179
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,083
that is the real saint

180
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:56,541
Sadhu is not the one who will tell him that you bring coconut from the market, you bring these sweets, you bring the box of ghee of this company.

181
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,750
You can bring any material of this company, he is not a saint.

182
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:09,500
They work just to fill their stomachs

183
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:15,791
If he is a real saint then he will not talk to you about money.

184
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:22,583
will not ask you to bring anything

185
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:29,291
By remembering only God and praising God - Oh Supreme Father Supreme Soul

186
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:38,083
Whatever mistake this child has committed knowingly or unknowingly, forgive him and let him go.

187
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,625
they cure it with mantra

188
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,166
Interviewer:What is the place of Sadhu in Hindu religion?

189
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:53,958
baba: See, Sadhu has a very important place in Hinduism.

190
00:19:55,791 --> 00:20:05,916
that is our present day Hindus, our brothers, mothers, sisters, our small children.

191
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:15,416
They are shy in adopting their Hindu religion, that is, they are hesitant.

192
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,500
they are not coming forward properly

193
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,666
why are they not coming

194
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:33,500
What is the meaning of today's generation that the world is only concerned with its own interests and not with the interests of others?

195
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:44,166
They say that if one's work is done then other people can go to hell, that is why today's man is so behind and so busy.

196
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:46,875
do you agree

197
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:55,041
If a person respects time, time will respect him, if it doesn't do it today, it will do it tomorrow.

198
00:20:55,875 --> 00:21:03,333
Look, we only have time, if we respect time then time will respect us.

199
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,625
Have you ever heard that clapping is done with one hand?

200
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:17,125
So if you see, unless our two hands and fingers touch, then where will the clapping come from, where will the sound come from?

201
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:25,375
So this is how humans are, like the lines on hands, man is moving away from man.

202
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:31,125
So that's why the position of Hindu is going backwards and more backward

203
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,458
Interviewer: No no, what is the importance of Sadhu in Hindu religion?

204
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,583
baba: What is the religion of a sadhu?

205
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:44,166
Interviewer: What is the recognition of a Sadhu in Hindu religion?  What is the place of a sadhu in Hindu religion?

206
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,708
See as far as our Guruji has told us

207
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:59,625
Look at the place of Sadhu, this whole tradition which has been going on since the time of our great saints and sages.

208
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:12,458
Looking at the place, the Sadhu does not need any place, any spot, any property, he only needs a quiet environment, within a small space.

209
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:22,833
You can take it in any form, you can take it on the banks of Mother Ganga or somewhere in the middle of the mountains, or there is some clean and neat place on the side, you can consider that place.

210
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:34,458
He has no attachment to that thing, no greed with that, which means that if I am doing penance at this place then we should take over this place, or we will grab it from the public by chanting mantras, there is nothing like that.

211
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:41,375
A sadhu only wants to remain engrossed in his sadhana and that is the religion of a sadhu and that is his karma.

212
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,750
And to believe what is the place of a saint.

213
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:46,750
that is

214
00:22:48,875 --> 00:23:00,875
Like we have temples, we have places of Lord Shankar, Mother Parvati, whatever our Gods and Goddesses, our ancestors, they have their places, the saints like to stay there only.

215
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:10,875
So that is also why the present day human being is also a little distanced from the saints.

216
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:18,791
Interviewer: Can a normal person give up those things which he does not want?

217
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:28,625
How to be saved from the attachments that exists?  How can one set out on the true path?

218
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:37,541
baba: See, following the true path is not such a difficult task.

219
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:43,416
Now it's as if you just start considering  from your home.

220
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:54,041
If we are fearless of anything, we can do anything and overcome anything

221
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,041
So

222
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:01,458
like what is

223
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:13,125
Man is not able to complete that task with his emotions, his actions, his religion.

224
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:35,541
Interviewer: Like Baba, we saw that here in Banaras there is no concept of life and death, here even death is celebrated with great enthusiasm, people are living life, so should we be afraid of death or should we live life with full enjoyment.  And because death is also a decision of God

225
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:43,291
baba: See, life is too long to accept, it is too big.

226
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:47,208
But

227
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:53,250
We consider a sleeping person to be dead.

228
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:58,958
We believe that a sleeping person is already dead.

229
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,041
Let me tell you why

230
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:12,500
Look, as long as a person gets up, sits, eats, does his work during the day, his life is going on.

231
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:14,625
he is successful

232
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:27,250
And just as a man sleeps at night after eating, drinking and doing his work, he is dead because there is no trust for a second, not even for a moment.

233
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:29,833
At what time does heart failure can occur?

234
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,000
do you agree

235
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:35,416
that's a happy death

236
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:48,000
The person who takes care of someone's expenses or has medical problems gets sidelined.

237
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,666
like untimely death

238
00:25:52,583 --> 00:26:01,000
Like dying due to illness, dying due to an accident, dying after being hit by a train, that is an untimely death.

239
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:06,458
If we do good deeds in our life, we will do righteous deeds of God.

240
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:16,833
So this life is very beautiful and this is a very long path to God, which man cannot achieve.

241
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:26,583
Interviewer: Do you ever remember old things and feel like going back?

242
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:36,166
baba: No, sometimes we sit alone, then meditate...

243
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:42,791
someone came in background so interviewer asked him to move out of the frame and asked baba to start again

244
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:46,083
Interviewer: Sometimes I feel like going
back to my life, meaning all this.

245
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:56,208
baba: See, when we are lonely, for some time
we think, what we were and what we did.

246
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:58,958
And what are we doing now and what have we become

247
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:10,666
See, for some time a saint also feels and he just feels but is unable to reach there.

248
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:16,458
He comes back to his path, comes back to his karma and dharma, comes back to his place.

249
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:26,125
We can only feel them a little bit, nothing more can be done.

250
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:27,875
Interviewer: Do you want to get something?

251
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:38,666
baba: Look, there is a lot to gain and we have lost a lot of ours.

252
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:43,083
So we have lived this entire life in the name of God only.

253
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:53,083
So what are we getting?  We are getting only the praise of God, we are getting only His hymns and Kirtans.

254
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:02,083
And we pray to God that O God, please keep everyone good in our Hindu religion.

255
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:11,166
There should not be any kind of disturbance in our Hindu religion.

256
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:15,375
And our Hindu religion continues to progress like this.

257
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:19,666
Interviewer: Will ask you one last question

258
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:20,333
baba: yes

259
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:38,916
Interviewer: Would like to ask one last question, do you want to convey any message to the youth of the country today or tell them how to follow the true path, or want to give some advice about religion?

260
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:47,166
baba: Look, karma is human's, according to us karma is the first thing.

261
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:54,000
If a person does not work then how will he progress?

262
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:57,333
We don't believe this is how life works

263
00:28:57,708 --> 00:29:00,333
there is no life without karma

264
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:05,958
If we do good deeds then God gives us real results.

265
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:07,791
do you agree

266
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:19,416
So we see, whenever someone comes to us, be it someone younger, someone older, someone a sister, someone a mother, someone a father, we just tell them that look.

267
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:29,166
Stay home, stay healthy, take care of your parents and move on with your life

268
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:38,708
Whatever you want to achieve in your life, you will achieve it and your life will always be good.

269
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:47,875
So we tell everyone to praise God, do their work as per rules and always be happy in life.

270
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:59,625
Interviewer: Is there anything in you that you regret?  It means that you have done some wrong thing and such a feeling is coming inside you which bothers you?

271
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:08,125
baba: No see, till date we have not felt anything like this inside us or inside our mind or inside our body.

272
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:12,541
If there is anything inside then only God's name is there.

273
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,125
Interviewer: Don't you ever feel like getting married?

274
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:23,166
Baba: Look, there was time for us to get married, but we never thought of getting married.

275
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:31,958
I don't know why that thought has not come to our mind since childhood that why are we a little different from the world, why are our thoughts different.

276
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:33,333
a little

277
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:45,791
People had created problems with us that because of this you have become a saint, your friends have separated from you.

278
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Look, no one walks with anyone, there comes a time when even your own shadow leaves you.

279
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:55,875
do you agree

280
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:01,583
So parents, brothers and sisters, you know that everything is an attachment

281
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:03,041
do you agree

282
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:04,708
so

283
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:14,583
Till date, if I have felt anything like this, I have only felt meditation on God's name and we praise Him only.

284
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,750
and take care of them only
