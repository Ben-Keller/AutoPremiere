00:00:02,666 --> 00:00:03,625
interviewer:Hello Baba

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:04,291
baba: Hello

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,833
Interviewer: Har Har Mahadev baba: Har Har Mahadev

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,833
Interviewer: Baba, please introduce yourself a little, what is your name, what do you do, which place is this, where are we?

5
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:21,250
baba: You are talking to me in Kashi right now, this place is called Kashi, and why is it called Kashi?

6
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:30,666
Here the giver, the provider of our three worlds, whatever you say, whatever way you believe in Him, whatever name you can give,

7
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:36,500
He placed his foot here, hence it was called Kashi, it became an abode of salvation.

8
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:48,958
Big kings and people came here from their countries, built their own palaces, stayed here for a few days, and also did some meditation for their salvation.

9
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:55,958
All the good things, whatever they understood, according to the earlier accounts, they went away.

10
00:00:56,333 --> 00:01:05,291
Because of them, today this simple environment here has changed and become completely crowded.

11
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:15,500
And some come out of their devotion, earlier there were some devotees here who did not take food or water for many months before leaving their homes.

12
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:26,333
Some people did not even drink water. If we go to Kashi for ten to fifteen days, we will take food and water there and some work for our salvation will also be done.

13
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:33,250
We will also get something else, and this is Kashi because the birth we get is of a human being.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:45,708
This human body that we have got, calls us here once and gives us an opportunity so that if you want to come and earn some of your karma, then come here and earn it.

15
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:55,750
Take that karma, no one earns it now
interviewer: why
baba: Now some of the work of the people has become like this, the comfort of money has become like this.

16
00:01:55,875 --> 00:02:00,083
That the whole environment started moving in a different way.

17
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:06,125
And there was so much money involved in the house that there was more work than earning.

18
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,541
Do you understand what I am saying?

19
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,625
that this environment has all changed now

20
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,666
Interviewer: Baba, I am facing some problem just a minute.

21
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:34,791
interviewer discussing some issues with the camera

22
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:40,458
Baba, you have lived a big life in so many years...
baba: whole life

23
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,625
Interviewer: So one minute, you have seen Kashi changing, so tell me how it has changed.

24
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:55,833
baba: See, Kashi was such a place that you are seeing Raja Harishchandra Ghat, he was God himself.

25
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:05,541
When he came to the mortal world, this Ramayana, whatever stories were created in the mortal world, all these were created for you, us, all of us to learn from this.

26
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:13,916
The rest he had no need, no need, he is the master of all three times and can do whatever he wants with himself.

27
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,291
are you understanding

28
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:22,000
And no one in this entire world has gone like Harishchandra did.

29
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:29,791
He left with his own body, no one has ever left like this before.

30
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:35,791
He definitely came with his body, but did not go, he too left his body here only

31
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:41,166
This is the biggest specialty of Kashi
Interviewer: How is Kashi now?

32
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:52,791
Now see, if the government doesn't do anything then nothing will happen, if you don't get some fun then you won't even appreciate that place.

33
00:03:53,083 --> 00:04:05,083
Just because of that thing, the whole atmosphere started changing, then when all the fun and enjoyment was within the limit, everything was fine, now when it started exceeding the limit, it started going out of control.

34
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:15,041
And this is bound to happen, the work that works with limits then starts moving a little more towards working without limits.

35
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:25,250
But he has told all these things, we have spoiled it ourselves, we will correct it ourselves, we will do everything ourselves.

36
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:30,625
Now they won't do anything here, we you have to do all the work.

37
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:35,833
Your good deeds and sins will also be done by our hands.

38
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:44,041
Look at this wealth. The environment from which wealth comes to your house is the same environment from which your family is created.

39
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,458
he also runs the same way

40
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:55,791
You see whether it is small or big, if it is less somewhere then it is in the direction of less.

41
00:04:55,791 --> 00:05:05,833
But the way it is going, it was not like this earlier, earlier people did not see what the person on our side was eating.

42
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,416
If he's eating this thing, we need this thing

43
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:15,208
He used to understand that this is good in his luck, this is not good in our luck.

44
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:21,208
So we let him go, but not anymore, now he tries to get that thing

45
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,125
That effort also fails so much that the man becomes ready to do anything.

46
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:34,375
Baba: This is what I have seen changing.
Interviewer: Has jealousy and envy changed in people?

47
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:40,875
baba: Just seeing this, if he is doing so much then why are we not getting it?

48
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:53,416
Now if everyone does not get good clothes, if the person next to you is wearing a saree worth ten thousand or you have bought a pant worth ten thousand.

49
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:57,583
And if your friend has not taken it then he will face a little problem.

50
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,250
no matter how close he gets to you

51
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,291
And the biggest relationship is

52
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:10,041
The relationship which Lord Krishna himself has explained to Arjun

53
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:19,333
He said that these are the relationships, after death your own relatives throw you out of the house, it doesn't even take two minutes.

54
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:27,041
It didn't even take two minutes and people would mourn for a few days

55
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:33,250
Now in place of that grief, some people started giving place to addiction, this changed.

56
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:41,250
Earlier it was not like this, there were no sources of intoxication, now there is a source of intoxication.

57
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:47,375
Just as there is a need for medicine in every house, there is also a drug addict in every house.

58
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,375
Earlier there were not drug addicts in every house

59
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:57,750
If someone was wrong in the house, four members of the house would taunt him and correct him.

60
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:02,041
Used to bring him on the right path but now it is not so

61
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:06,958
Now, if we show someone the right path, then no person is more wrong than us.

62
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:11,375
Interviewer: Baba, what is the right path?

63
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:22,208
The right path that I am telling you, whatever you love, I will tell you to do everything, and where you put obstacles will become the most loved.

64
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:31,916
That path is deteriorating, you are not able to understand that thing, and you are losing everything in a short time.

65
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:39,541
This is the biggest earning of karma, getting this body is the biggest earning of karma.

66
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:52,375
You get it through great deeds, you don't get it just like that, because the one who made you a machine and made you sit here, you also made an equally big machine.

67
00:07:52,583 --> 00:08:02,458
You, who are you, started flying airplanes even in the clouds, you started making airwaves, and started telling that it will rain today, today the wind will blow strong.

68
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:11,791
If you start taking so much information from your machine, then the machine you have created is the same.

69
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:20,000
He has made a machine inside you, only when that machine works inside you, you can make this machine.

70
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:33,416
This is the right path, but see today, tell anyone now, he will say that there is a lot of tension, hey, if there is tension, will it go away by drinking alcohol?

71
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:39,583
Will it end by smoking cigarettes? It is very important to resolve tension

72
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:50,916
If one wants to solve that tension properly for the right reasons, it will not be able to solve it because the number of those who do not do so is more.

73
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:56,875
And the number of solutions became very small, down to just a tiny count.

74
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:06,541
So where will you be able to walk, where will we be able to take you, you will not be able to walk, it is very easy to say but very difficult to do.

75
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,958
Interviewer: Nothing will change now, is everything spoiled?

76
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,458
baba: All this automatically, now Kaliyuga has shown its effect, and you are under its influence, understand.

77
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:28,875
Kaliyuga has shown its effect, Kaliyuga speaks (someone interrupted from behind and a cross talk is going on in last few seconds)

78
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:35,166
This is the effect of Kalyug and Kalyug is showing its effect.

79
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,375
there is nothing else

80
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:44,416
Sin is from us, virtue is from us, everything is from us

81
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,333
Interviewer: Baba, what is the life of a saint like?

82
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:58,208
baba: The greatest life of a saint is the one which I have told you that if he is a true devotee then he should have no connection with this earth.

83
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:10,416
It is not that you are taking the support of any ashram, or taking the support of anything else, you are eating and living and have made your accounts.

84
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,375
it doesn't matter

85
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:24,166
The real devotee is the one who has to search for everything every day, we are from Kashi here, we have uprooted so much of who we are from these people.

86
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:30,166
That our hairs were down to our feet but people uprooted them and made it look like this

87
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:40,458
So some remained but some did not, these things should not be said, this is our birthplace and people from our country as well as from abroad come here.

88
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,541
but they do this

89
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:50,250
They don't let the right person live, when you live with them properly then you will be happy.

90
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:57,666
Now this is our karma, we can neither fight with you nor do anything, we are troubled from both the sides.

91
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:08,875
But we are troubled because you do not know that there are some like us who are keeping..

92
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,125
The destruction of this earth on hold

93
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:22,333
If there were no people like us, this earth would have been destroyed long ago, but now there are some, they are left, but neither can you understand them.

94
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:33,291
Neither do you have that much time, because since birth your time is busy only in eating, only in your lust, you will just remain busy in that and go away.

95
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,833
I don't care about you, just leave us

96
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,958
After this, now you understand, finish it, it is not right to speak too much.

97
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:57,750
Interviewer: We will not talk about this, we will talk about something else, tell us about kashi . they says that here even death is celebrated as a celebration because it is also God's decision and tell us about the soul that the soul, Where does it go?

98
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,583
baba: That soul, it is for that soul only that the celebration is celebrated here.

99
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:12,250
Because this is such a place, such a place where whoever sets his feet here, his soul will find peace.

100
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:22,083
You left this soil and died somewhere else, in your village, in your country.

101
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:30,875
So the soul will not get as much peace as it will get from this soil, that is why this soil has been named Kashi.

102
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:38,958
That's why he has given us an opportunity to correct our deeds on this earth.

103
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:42,750
That after earning our karma, we come back as something.

104
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,083
do you understand

105
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:49,250
Interviewer: So Kashi has a lot of importance in Hindu religion? baba: Yes, it is

106
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:56,041
baba: The biggest specialty of Hindu religion is that you can look at any religion.

107
00:12:56,083 --> 00:13:02,791
It is only in this that one who has not done even a single action ahead of religion, leave aside the rest.

108
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:14,791
Leave aside the rest, what is bigger than God himself coming and staying here and a flying thing came for him from the sky and he went in it.

109
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:21,750
Is there anyone else like it in the whole world? That is why this is Kashi. That's why it is their heaven

110
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:30,708
Here many of your sins are forgiven, do you think how many sins can be liberated by taking a bath in Ganga once?

111
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:41,041
The more you clean your mind and take a bath, the more your sins will be washed away, but your mind is not clean and your sins go away along with you.

112
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,916
You just clear your mind, Jai Ho
