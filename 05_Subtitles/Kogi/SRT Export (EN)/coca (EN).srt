1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,958
So can you explain

2
00:00:04,958 --> 00:00:09,791
what are you doing and what is this plant?

3
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:13,458
Well, this one kills

4
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:14,875
is called,

5
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:17,375
we traditionally,

6
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:20,875
This is xxxx .

7
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:21,291
Yeah

8
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:25,666
and it is a bush, a sacred bush.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,750
A sacred daughter of Mother Earth.

10
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,958
She is a woman too.

11
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,958
Therefore, when it grows

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,458
she blooms,

13
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,416
bloom and

14
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:43,833
bloom

15
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,208
and they vote for a fruit, the red seed,

16
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:50,791
Like us women who grow, we flourish

17
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,291
and we reproduce.

18
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:58,208
The same thing happens with the xxxx bush .

19
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:02,000
She is a sacred bush that we xxxx ,

20
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,583
Well, men xxxx , we

21
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:08,958
The women pick it up and the men

22
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:12,916
They roast it in a clay pot

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,333
and they chew it

24
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,375
with lime,

25
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:22,416
They chew it and then that leaf

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,916
they pass it to the calabash

27
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,583
which becomes the poporo.

28
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:33,583
So yes, it is a sacred bush.

29
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,250
And that

30
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,833
because men use it, what is produced for them?

31
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,208
good since

32
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,000
the beginning

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,791
They left us this bush for men to chew

34
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,750
and

35
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,416
When they are men, they chew it and then

36
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,833
they deliver the mamos with their authorization,

37
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,666
Now they can chew,

38
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:03,666
symbolizing that a man can now have a woman.

39
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,583
So, that's why, since this is a woman,

40
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,458
now they can chew

41
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,416
the sheet

42
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:09,166
represents

43
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:13,208
the woman and that they can already have a woman.

44
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,666
This also helps

45
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,541
how to alleviate hunger,

46
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,500
that when he is on the hill,

47
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,416
when it's like in a meeting,

48
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:27,833
He starts chewing and concentrating.

49
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:32,333
When he is concentrated, he is with the bush, chewing the bush.

50
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:32,875
Women too?

51
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,375
The leaves, the leaves, chewing the little leaves.

52
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:39,125
No, not women, we only collect them

53
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:43,375
here. We

54
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,291
we do the work.

55
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,583
Is it a type, a plant,

56
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,750
coke-like guy too, or not?

57
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,625
This is the same coke.

58
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:57,583
But here the non-indigenous calls it coca, which

59
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,500
It sounds very very ugly,

60
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,416
that that name

61
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,250
that the non-indigenous gave him

62
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,083
They misused it, so they see it as a bad plant,

63
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,458
but it's not a bad bush,

64
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:14,791
It is a normal bush, for us it is a bush that does not have,

65
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,791
It doesn't do any harm, nothing.

66
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,833
The woman, yes a woman then

67
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,666
They train her badly because she is bad,

68
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:28,083
It's the same, for us it is a normal bush,

69
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:32,958
It doesn't have any, it doesn't do any damage, it's a normal bush.

70
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,875
But what does it do very well?

71
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:39,833
Yeah.
And they plant it here?
Yeah.

72
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,666
All. Every family

73
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,666
or each couple has their…

74
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:50,041
its nuance of xxxx , that is its traditional name.

75
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,083
xxxx .

76
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:57,166
And it also grows here, like naturally here?

77
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,708
Yes, this is natural here in the mountains, in any climate,

78
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,791
It is born in any climate.

79
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:08,625
Very good.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,166
How

81
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,416
nan

82
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:23,708
do you collect?

83
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,916
We pick it up individually, as a group.

84
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:30,708
When we are in a meeting in the town, well

85
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,708
we go in a small group and

86
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:36,750
We pick up, we help each other just like what happens in the Big House.

87
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,750
In xxxx

88
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:43,583
to help us,

89
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,041
I don't know if you have heard the word xxxx ,

90
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:50,291
It's like helping each other,

91
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,916
being together, xxxx , like always helping each other.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,125
Like the store?

93
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,125
Like the store, that's why it's called xxxx .

94
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,333
And that's like helping each other?

95
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,041
Mutually.

96
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:06,666
This also helps us

97
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,458
that we share, that

98
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:12,750
Let's talk, one is picking up the bush and is talking, this...

99
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,791
Yeah.

100
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:18,500
So the leaves grow back?

101
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,541
If one removes all the leaves

102
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,541
and that's it

103
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:26,250
After two weeks it comes back and sprouts, it grows little leaves.

104
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:30,541
and now they turn this color like this.

105
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,083
When they are cool

106
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,416
They are like more yellowish green.

107
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:39,500
When they are ready to chew,

108
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,416
collect, for consumption it is already like this, it turns greener,

109
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,291
dark green.

110
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,416
Can you show us the yellow ones?

111
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:52,083
The yellow ones are cooler here.

112
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,541
Are

113
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,125
They are bugs,

114
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:59,083
They are very buggy.

115
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,083
On the other hand, this one is already good.

116
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,708
So when one is collecting nothing

117
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:08,750
collect these more, the ones that are like more

118
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,958
already like jecha

119
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,916
and leave this, only this.

120
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,166
Are plants asked for permission to do,

121
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:24,416
like to remove the sheets or

122
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,250
Is it an equally natural process?

123
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,916
No, it's the same, just the same

124
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,833
that when removing the leaves

125
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,708
You just don't have to mistreat them,

126
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,208
but to keep taking

127
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:41,083
only these leaves,

128
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,875
do not mistreat them,

129
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,541
Don't hurt this one,

130
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,541
because this is a new one that is coming out,

131
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,625
This is new, so you don't have to remove this one,

132
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,458
but just get here.

133
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,083
Know the plant.

134
00:06:56,083 --> 00:07:00,291
Yes, leave this one, because this one is for the next one

135
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,791
consumption.

136
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,291
Untill there.

137
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,333
And men do something

138
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:10,250
also for the poporo process with the shell?

139
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,791
Yes, with the shell.

140
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,666
And what is the process you do?

141
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,291
They collect the shell from the sea

142
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,875
They bring it and burn it

143
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,958
with

144
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,625
palm of… with palm stick,

145
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:30,166
They burn it and it turns to dust

146
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,666
and that's what they throw her in the dungeon

147
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,333
and consume it

148
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:40,500
with this.

149
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:45,375
From what age can plants be collected?

150
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,333
From what age do we collect it?

151
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:51,583
At the age of six, seven years

152
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,416
The girls now accompany their mother

153
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,291
to see and

154
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:57,791
already…

155
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:58,375
and to her

156
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,875
is collecting the leaves,

157
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:05,041
one tells him how he is going to do it

158
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,708
and they go

159
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,083
learning.

160
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,791
Yes,

161
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,458
and then

162
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:15,583
there are many plants here, how many,

163
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,250
I don't know, how much do they collect each time?

164
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,625
What we need, a backpack

165
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:27,041
two backpacks and tomorrow again and so on, whatever we need.

166
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:30,750
The work is constant.
As?

167
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,250
I mean, they constantly collect.

168
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,625
Yes, yes, always.

169
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,791
When we see that

170
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,791
our husbands are already running out,

171
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,500
We go and pick it up.

172
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,041
And I see that men also share leaves.

173
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:46,625
If they share it, it is a means of greeting.

174
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:50,500
This is not how you greet with your hand, but only the

175
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,250
you share

176
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,458
That's called sharing.

177
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:09,291
Yes, they share

178
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,750
the coke like that to the other

179
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,958
and the other shares.

180
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,166
One picks these seeds

181
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,375
and he plants them in another place and it is born.

182
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,125
Sometimes the leaves

183
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:41,625
We use the leaves as medicine,

184
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:45,250
It is used for... like for headaches, for ailments,

185
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,416
for pain inside the body.

186
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,750
One takes enough leaves, cooks them

187
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,458
and with that he bathes.

188
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,541
Yes, and that calms

189
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,208
pain.

190
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,416
This would be the seed.

191
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,583
It is not bad.

192
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:05,833
You can take it home as a decoration for the house.

193
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:09,291
No problem.

194
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,375
Isn't that prohibited?

195
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,125
how do you cook then?

196
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:19,500
Take plenty of leaves and cook with other plants,

197
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:25,333
like when the child has the flu that gives him a little pain,

198
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,208
headache, pain all over the body,

199
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:32,791
then take lemon leaves, lemon leaf, several leaves

200
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,583
They are used for the flu and you take a lot of this and put it on,

201
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:40,333
It is cooked and when it is already medium cold

202
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:45,333
you bathe with it or the baby or the person

203
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,416
and also the leaves can cook

204
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:53,083
about five or ten leaves and cook enough

205
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,416
and drink with tea.

206
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,666
Tea that also works

207
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:01,250
as for the pain

208
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:07,125
Yes, then the kill is not bad.

209
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:17,208
I looked at how it turned out, now

210
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:24,333
It is, it was left without leaves.

211
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,708
To be reborn again in

212
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,125
two weeks?

213
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:36,041
In two weeks that's it, it's already growing leaves.
