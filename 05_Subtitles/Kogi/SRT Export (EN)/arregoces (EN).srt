1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,625
Well, you can say

2
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:05,125
first of all his name and

3
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:06,333
Where we are?

4
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:08,458
Where are we today?

5
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,291
My name is ArregocÃ©s Councilor

6
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:13,291
I am Council Governor of the Kogui people

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,041
xxxx 's site ,

8
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,750
there next to it.

9
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,666
xxxx , and the one here is called xxxx

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,041
what is called in Spanish,

11
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,708
It is called Villa Lucia.

12
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:30,083
So we are on my farm.

13
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,583
Very good. And well

14
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,208
can you tell me a little about

15
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:37,208
the conservation project,

16
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:40,625
what they are doing in recovering territory.

17
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,416
We have seen a lot, we have already gone to the river,

18
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:47,208
there at xxxx , also Domingueca and all that journey.

19
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,416
And I don't know, can you tell a little bit of the story.

20
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,333
Where are they now?

21
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:55,333
Well,

22
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:56,333
the process

23
00:00:56,333 --> 00:01:00,916
We have about 35 years of the struggle process,

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,750
the recovery of ancestral territory on the black line.

25
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,208
The objective of the territory,

26
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:13,208
The objective was four objectives, one

27
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:17,041
The objective is to recover the ancestral territory.

28
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:20,916
The second objective was

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,625
recover

30
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,750
At that time they called the lost city.

31
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,916
When they said the lost city they were all Tuma,

32
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,916
all stones up and down.

33
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,458
That was the strategy.

34
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,833
The third strategy,

35
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,416
They talked about going out to sea,

36
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,500
but that wasn't the point.

37
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,500
No, it wasn't that, that problem, but

38
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,666
It's all upstream and downstream.

39
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:51,791
Everything found on the coast was

40
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:55,791
the strategy and the fourth strategy is

41
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,041
governability, govern

42
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:03,083
both internal and external, governance, governing.

43
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,625
That's the great strategy.

44
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,958
In the 5th and 6th they asked for support, education, health

45
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,416
And we have already advanced.

46
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:15,375
But that is no longer a cultural part, but an external one.

47
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:16,458
So I believe

48
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:20,166
that this strategy,

49
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,333
I think that

50
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,833
we have advanced,

51
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,625
imagine from here

52
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:30,625
More or less on foot eight hours from here eight hours

53
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:35,208
In a few years, to where your town was,

54
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:40,083
Until xxxx we have recovered it.

55
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:44,000
It's a fight.

56
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,583
Recovery first,

57
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:50,083
The sacred site was more punctual,

58
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,833
because the sacred site is

59
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:56,083
territorial planning is order

60
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,666
both environmental, social, human,

61
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,916
Spiritual, it is everything we want to aim for.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,500
They are under him,

63
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,916
the sites under sacred space and site.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,708
I think we have made progress,

65
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,583
With that of the recovery of sacred sites,

66
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:19,083
since that is almost as we would say, it is the principle of order,

67
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,083
the principle of order.

68
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,791
And of course we can talk about it as a life plan

69
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,416
you can also talk,

70
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,666
and I think that

71
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,750
we have bet, advanced...

72
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,750
and which one is it

73
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,958
that recovery from that,

74
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,875
which

75
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,875
As a result to leave them

76
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:48,625
In the Spanish name we have said seventy percent leave regeneration,

77
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,500
seventy percent

78
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,333
and thirty percent light.

79
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,166
Where are you

80
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,791
here,

81
00:03:56,791 --> 00:04:00,000
When I came here, this was pure pasture.

82
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:00,833
a hill,

83
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,250
It was a hill. It's a hill.

84
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:03,958
you what you see

85
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,958
That was a hill.

86
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,083
Look what we have regenerated.

87
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,875
We have regenerated it.

88
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,708
This entire area that

89
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,708
You see, it was pure hill.

90
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,708
But from this, through this

91
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:23,500
We have regenerated and we can demonstrate it.

92
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:27,041
It is not an invention, but reality.

93
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,750
Yeah.

94
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,416
So those are, that's what we put it in.

95
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,791
mathematically to see the

96
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,333
results,

97
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:40,208
to formulate projects, to manage new things.

98
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,333
We can show it with that,

99
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,625
with this regeneration that we have done.

100
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,000
This regeneration not only

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,500
the tree regenerates

102
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,583
the species is regenerated

103
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,500
the birds, the species of reptiles,

104
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,083
species many species.

105
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,666
They also recover

106
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,083
some wetlands,

107
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,666
some wetlands recover, other wetlands

108
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,666
suddenly they are also leaving.

109
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,375
But I have to explain this, the reason why,

110
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,500
because underground

111
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,041
there was the water bank,

112
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:23,041
It is what the world remembers, it is said gold, gold

113
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,958
wrist, snake gold,

114
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,583
that was the bank of what was here

115
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:34,583
artificial, it is what maintains, sustains it,

116
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,083
the blood of the earth.

117
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,250
These areas are guaqueado, this

118
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,250
They put the area in shape ,

119
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,416
They brought many golden dolls,

120
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,666
many and many graves.

121
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,583
That today those many tombs

122
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,583
you find in the gold museum

123
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,625
and is international,

124
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,125
you find them for the outside world

125
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,500
It is an element to see, an element to life,

126
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,500
the indigenous people are life

127
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,666
of the soul, of diversity,

128
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,833
the life of the species, the life of the earth,

129
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,875
the heart of the lands.

130
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:17,000
So little of it has remained,

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,500
we have come

132
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:24,250
strengthening.

133
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,791
Also many

134
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,583
They made a mess, the road, look at this road.

135
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,208
On the road it is nice to walk well,

136
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,041
but it also leaves a consequence for the future,

137
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,916
a future.

138
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,666
So

139
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,875
I think the story is

140
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:50,000
That's the story.

141
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,708
AND

142
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:55,625
when we talk about one's own education, one's own health,

143
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,750
because it is under the sacred site,

144
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,250
the order of the sacred site.

145
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,541
And when we talk about handling

146
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:07,458
or education, or diversity control management,

147
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:12,583
The management is under the order of the Sacred Site.

148
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,958
For this reason today

149
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,916
indigenous, that of the people

150
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:21,083
we do not live only in thinking

151
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:25,500
in book, think about hospitals.

152
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,500
No, still today the XXX town

153
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,708
Live with your own health.

154
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:36,875
The university with territory, that is, with territory.

155
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,958
And yet

156
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,958
we believe 90%.

157
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,333
That is, not living like here,

158
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:48,166
This is a land, this is a stick, right?

159
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,750
That is 90%.

160
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,083
Have, have as a full heart

161
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:57,000
in life and we live it with it.

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,708
That is why I believe that the Kogi people's culture still

163
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:03,000
and this is lived, exercised, practiced,

164
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:06,458
it is, it is done,

165
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:11,208
but with this majority of the outside system

166
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:15,291
If the Kogi people fall asleep they absorb it.

167
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,666
That's why I think pay attention to those.

168
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,791
So I think the process

169
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,250
has occurred in that

170
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,833
and not only this area

171
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,833
but the entire area of the mountains.

172
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,875
We have made progress in those directions

173
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,750
and

174
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,625
I think that

175
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,958
we keep moving forward.

176
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,416
But imagine one

177
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:47,458
live in three apartment

178
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,583
almost more than

179
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:53,666
22 - 24 municipalities more or less.

180
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,750
Imagine the three corporations

181
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,916
and different, different laws

182
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:06,500
What a National Park, imagine living within those systems

183
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,958
and since that law is for it, that law

184
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,708
It is above the origin law.

185
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,083
I mean,

186
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,458
why they discovered us, they say,

187
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:18,708
They discovered us, that's what they believe about the Constitution

188
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:22,625
that is, the Constitution, is that these people are

189
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,666
that we found him dying

190
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,000
and we saved him.

191
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,291
For that very reason

192
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,791
We don't believe that they saved us,

193
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,666
but we are thousands of years old.

194
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,833
We are native, we are from a nation,

195
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:40,791
We are native and we are from some natives there,

196
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:45,791
of a nation, that is, born from there, a nation

197
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:50,875
and that nation has a complete command structure.

198
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,625
But of course

199
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,375
than most outside

200
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,125
just since '91, it's just that

201
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,791
They say that they are recognizing us as we are.

202
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,625
It's not right, you have to listen to it

203
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,291
and most of them have to be listened to,

204
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:10,166
but with these laws that are being reformed

205
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:14,000
in different governments in power,

206
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,541
well we are going to be

207
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,791
inside, living together.

208
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:23,666
It's time to live together, and time to live together and time to learn it.

209
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,458
Learn from it to get by or else they will swallow you

210
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,416
alive.

211
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:32,625
Big megaprojects, look at the megaprojects

212
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:36,541
and that is to be very careful

213
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,166
Or it would lead us to the indigenous division,

214
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,666
because it is convenient for the government to create divisions.

215
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,708
Sure, totally.

216
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,250
That party, different parties,

217
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,208
Well, that is injected into our heads,

218
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,875
Well, in Colombia they have already broken up many indigenous people.

219
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,208
In the mountains we are also already

220
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:59,666
is messing, breaking that balance

221
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,750
and that leads us to lose governability.

222
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,791
So I trust humans

223
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,166
that this is not going to be lost, because we have to face it,

224
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,458
That is, you have to have it permanent.

225
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,375
That must be continued.

226
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:19,583
The people, the woman, the child, follow

227
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:24,458
in training, training, permanently follow

228
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,541
that it is not a speech, but it is an experience

229
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,666
live it, execute it, practice it.

230
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:35,458
So I think that

231
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,416
the struggles we have achieved.

232
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,875
The Constitution

233
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:43,125
recognizes something paragraphite , they have barely developed,

234
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,291
They only say the right to ethnic diversity.

235
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,125
But that's one point,

236
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:52,250
It is a number, but how is it developed, how is it implemented?

237
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,291
that's what suddenly

238
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,583
we wanted to implement,

239
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,583
but the outside model is already built.

240
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,583
No, that has to be like that, it has to be like that, it has to

241
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,333
And if it is more with a weight sign,

242
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,833
It's your turn to enter that box.

243
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,708
If you don't agree, there's nothing.

244
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,333
So

245
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,291
I think that makes things clear.

246
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,333
That's why

247
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,208
I think the Kogi people

248
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:22,500
we keep thinking

249
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,416
recover the territory

250
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,166
and to recover the territory

251
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,708
we need to make visible and make visible.

252
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:35,875
We have done more in documents, in writing,

253
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:36,833
we have written it.

254
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:40,958
There will be lots of documents.

255
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,625
That's why I think

256
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,166
of the last few years

257
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,208
of those documents that we have written

258
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,416
becomes a visualization,

259
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,708
that visualization, since it is required

260
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:59,416
what some of us have come to document,

261
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,333
which we are going to do with you as a start,

262
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,625
as a start on this, let's rehearse it

263
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:11,291
Let's see if this documentary turns out much better, and

264
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:15,125
We can continue making a documentary from the wasteland

265
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:19,916
Downwards, levels in stops for further down,

266
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,166
So I believe that the world outside

267
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,750
go with visibility,

268
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,791
If you have regenerated, good, but prove it.

269
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:29,916
Thank goodness we

270
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,708
We don't have a photograph when we received that,

271
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:37,166
Suddenly there must be one there, here we don't have it.

272
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,875
So I think that today

273
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,416
We have to start proving.

274
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:48,666
In documentary what was, what is

275
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,375
very difficult, it was.

276
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,083
Know

277
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,208
what today, more or less we can believe that

278
00:13:55,208 --> 00:14:00,166
But if that is a mountain, no, what you were.

279
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,000
I think that's what we haven't bet on.

280
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,000
So

281
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,833
I think the message is,

282
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,458
The message is for everyone

283
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,625
,the message is from the ancestral territory.

284
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,875
The message of the XXX organization,

285
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,958
is to make visible.

286
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:22,000
Let's start doing the documentary exercise.

287
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,208
So, if you talk about the documentary,

288
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:30,041
we can make the documentary in several things, some

289
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,375
as sacred spaces

290
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:36,583
or some we can see

291
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,958
like in the upper part

292
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,500
that does not have a forest, others that have a forest,

293
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,500
others what we have recovered

294
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,833
and another on the black line,

295
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:54,208
I think that more or less you were doing the exercise.

296
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,208
I think since he's new to new things

297
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,208
What we are going to do is not going to be complete.

298
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:04,625
And what we lack. I know that has a continuation

299
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:10,541
and I think that this documentation is going to take us a memory,

300
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:14,500
because the youth, the young people,

301
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:19,458
If memory or history does not know it,

302
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,541
In the outside world it is said that,

303
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,583
he who does not know his history

304
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,208
It is repeated, as they call that.

305
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,833
So I do believe that

306
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,250
here in the mountains

307
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,708
we present the heart of the world

308
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,291
we signed it there a few years ago

309
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:42,291
20 years, 25 years or so,

310
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,708
we made a heart of the world.

311
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,375
The second we made the Moon

312
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:54,083
but that's almost what we command,

313
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,375
We do not lead it,

314
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,708
If not, someone took it and it stayed there.

315
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,958
The same thing can happen, you take it and it stays there.

316
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,041
I think that on my part it is time to continue following up

317
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,500
how far we want to go,

318
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,500
What do we want to achieve with that?

319
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,125
So

320
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,625
I think that

321
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,500
It is important.

322
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,291
Then he was telling the story, more

323
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:28,625
at least, bone

324
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:32,041
my dad told me that when he was little above

325
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,625
He found this virgin mountain, the beach.

326
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:40,291
My dad tells me, that was like the year 40, the year 50.

327
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,750
Well then the dream is

328
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,833
It's like that. Finally

329
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,250
with this documentary that

330
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,708
It's what we want,

331
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:54,208
start as

332
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:57,875
evidence, make visible

333
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,250
and

334
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,916
the same ancestral territory.

335
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,708
The same documentary will talk

336
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:13,458
so that other countries start exchanging and

337
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:18,666
And I believe that the oxygen, the breezes,

338
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,000
the breeze,

339
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,041
I think the breeze is in the Sierra Nevada, in one place,

340
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,458
They already said XXX, then the breeze

341
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:31,666
I think that the force of the breeze, the snow,

342
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,666
and the sea

343
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,791
They are two things that help each other.

344
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,791
So

345
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,750
I think that

346
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,750
that's what more or less

347
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:49,041
I think I would do it as a little story.

348
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,416
what we started, the struggles

349
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:57,791
and what we are carrying and what is still missing.

350
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:58,500
so

351
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,416
Well, I think that would be something history,

352
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:06,208
This entire area was pure peasant,

353
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,041
peasant until eight hours from now,

354
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:13,083
full peasant and we have achieved it.

355
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:17,708
So finally, we continue looking for the partner,

356
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:22,708
we want to be a partner of the territory,

357
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:27,625
We are still looking for the partner, partner that means,

358
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,791
other donors.

359
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,625
Until now with the

360
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,916
XXX has been a little partner,

361
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,250
what about this year,

362
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,500
we have more or less recovered it to xxx

363
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,250
others

364
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,000
Xxx has been a partner for over 25 years

365
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,291
and we have recovered a lot.

366
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,375
It was once called The Tayrona Inheritance

367
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,041
from the movie Heart of the World.

368
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,416
It was called Tayrona Heritage

369
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,833
Why did they give them that Tayrona Heritage foundation?

370
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:03,125
Because the heir Tayrona, let him return it.

371
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,875
But Alan's foundation stayed there.

372
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,875
I mean, then like I'm demanding

373
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:14,666
the to reactivate the Tayrona inheritance,

374
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:18,875
because heir, the inheritance that everything he lost,

375
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:23,458
How do we recover it in the inheritance?

376
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,291
Then I will continue searching

377
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:30,791
the partner, a partner through donors

378
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:35,500
another we can look for partners of documentary filmmakers,

379
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,958
I know that this documentary can come out one or two,

380
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,583
which may be better or less.

381
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:46,291
I'm going to continue looking for a partner, documentary filmmakers,

382
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,208
and he is a documentary partner, he has to join.

383
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:53,208
In other words, it is not the interest of the documentarian.

384
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,916
of the other, but rather be a partner.

385
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,583
Let's look for one, two or I don't know,

386
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,875
for that documentary partner to join,

387
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:06,250
that this documentary filmmaker becomes a documentary

388
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,833
thick, big, capable

389
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:13,208
to start making the documentary presentation,

390
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,166
this presentation.

391
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:20,041
I think that is going to be more striking than in writing.

392
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,958
We have it there.

393
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:25,208
We have the book called XXX there,

394
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,333
it's a book. The book entry

395
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:32,625
It is a title that means trembling.

396
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:33,958
Which

397
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:38,416
the one from XXX We are showing the outside world,

398
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,041
That's how they are destroying it, that's how they are

399
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:44,041
ending, this is how they are ending it,

400
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,791
but in the letter,

401
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,708
I know that the documentary filmmaker

402
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:52,500
We have to do something as it is being destroyed,

403
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:56,625
I mean, it's over, yes, then

404
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,458
those XXX.

405
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:02,166
It is a message from the world cup that says beware

406
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,125
Let them begin to control the mountains,

407
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:10,166
eye that

408
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,250
from destroying the mountains so much is going to come

409
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,750
This XXX

410
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,291
That is why our message is

411
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:20,291
In many parts making a tremendous tremor,

412
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,500
It is a striking

413
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,208
What a tremendous lightning bolt it is doing to us.

414
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,416
It is a call that

415
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:30,583
Nature is making us, lower your attention,

416
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:37,458
The indigenous people know why that happens, so I think that

417
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,291
the message here

418
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:44,750
It's small that you are documenting it.

419
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,791
I think this is

420
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:52,625
that later we unify with the black line,

421
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:57,000
with the moor ahead. truly unify it,

422
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:57,583
seriously that

423
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:01,791
later, that documentary

424
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,000
We are not simply going to do it, but

425
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,541
It is a documentary of the future for youth,

426
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,291
for the new generations, to see it

427
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:13,708
as it was in the year 2023

428
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:18,083
and I don't know what year we are going to arrive, we don't know 2050, I don't know

429
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,750
What are we going to get to, let that youth look

430
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,250
That in the year 2023 it was like this,

431
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:28,541
and now 2035 we go like this.

432
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,625
They are like inventories

433
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:35,958
that you can begin to have the documentary inventory,

434
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:40,250
that is, documentary makes an inventory, that is an inventory

435
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:44,375
and that inventory must be kept in memory,

436
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:47,250
So there is not much inventory of indigenous people.

437
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,041
the world outside,

438
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:51,958
There is a lot of inventory, of BolÃ­var pod, which happened

439
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:55,083
So, I think that

440
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,000
the spiritual inventory does not

441
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,166
Let's do the inventory, but anyway

442
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:04,458
, in everyone's voice,

443
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,291
I think that would be

444
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,166
What I wanted how to make the message

445
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,958
and I think that, well, little essay

446
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,958
we are going to do this, little essay

447
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:22,041
that after you technically see and after

448
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:27,583
because they will see it necessary, if necessary, the

449
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:31,750
We will continue, we will continue with the documentation

450
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:34,333
and later

451
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:38,333
we can do social documentation.

452
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,958
I would put the child and that,

453
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:46,125
but we can do it later.

454
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:46,708
So

455
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:50,250
I think that would be like some history then.

456
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,041
of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta basin.

457
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,125
and then you

458
00:23:56,125 --> 00:24:00,250
I talk a little about GonawindÃºa - Tayrona can explain

459
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,458
Can you explain what the organization is?

460
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:04,833
And which indigenous peoples are included?

461
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:08,166
GonawindÃºa is physically a hill here,

462
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,583
It's a hill up there, you see the White Peak

463
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:16,416
and the Monte, and that GonawindÃºa has four ethnic groups,

464
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,375
The Arhuaco , Kogui, Kankuamo and Wiwa ,

465
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:25,041
what is experienced in the Sierra Nevada belongs to GonawindÃºa, GonawindÃºa is

466
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:30,166
Is

467
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:33,166
where is the life of diversity.

468
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,916
GonawindÃºa is a movement.

469
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:40,541
The word Go is something that factory

470
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:44,125
and at the same time a movement

471
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:45,916
,very good,

472
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:50,500
dua is everything that is the mountain range,

473
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:53,583
everything that is mountain range.

474
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:55,041
Yeah,

475
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,000
that's the movement,

476
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,916
That's why we call it the heart of the world,

477
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,583
because there he is,

478
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:07,083
GonawindÃºa is Tayrona

479
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:09,833
regarding Tayrona,

480
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:14,250
Tayrona is GonawindÃºa and Tayrona is the tomb.

481
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:16,583
The grave that the xxx xxx

482
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:20,458
and that grave is like that

483
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:24,333
It is the one who exercises governance.

484
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:28,250
In what you investigate, in what for the felling

485
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:31,666
to make a house, to build a road.

486
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,000
Every paradise has to be low

487
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,625
Consult, how the path should be, how it should be done

488
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:42,083
XXX, everything that is going to be done.

489
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,333
That's what we could

490
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:47,333
say, like the government, like

491
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:51,333
a state, that is, or like a government.

492
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:54,583
It is what would be called self-government,

493
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:57,208
because lately people talk about self-government,

494
00:25:57,208 --> 00:26:01,083
But what is self-government like? self government

495
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:04,666
It is the consultation, in what we do it is what it exercises.

496
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:06,750
Then GonawindÃºa

497
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,083
It certainly has a structure and GonawindÃºa

498
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:13,916
It is represented with the big house that is here.

499
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It has some columns, the big house inside.

500
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,500
Yes, they are the columns.

501
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,166
So when we speak we are moved, too

502
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:25,666
Is it the same, everything that the mountain has?

503
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,375
If then

504
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:30,458
GonawindÃºa is

505
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:34,208
the life of diversity, where it is,

506
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:37,291
where is the life of the earth, the life of the air,

507
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:40,125
better said, everyone's life.

508
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:42,000
where is life

509
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,166
Where is the lung ?

510
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,333
Yeah.

511
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:50,458
So like where is life?

512
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:54,708
It is that it achieves that the columns that it descends go down

513
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:59,166
That is why we fight for ancestral territory

514
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,708
let there be no disasters.

515
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:04,916
If one sees that there

516
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:07,958
It's like the XXX we believe

517
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:10,416
here is what we believe

518
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:13,500
XXX no, the XXX says there is the problem.

519
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,291
Here is the peak, it ends here, then all the water

520
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:21,875
,36 rivers in the Sierra Nevada and there are more in the rivers.

521
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:24,625
For this reason, water

522
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:28,875
It is a communication of the sea

523
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:32,583
to the lagoon above, it has communication,

524
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:35,291
has diversity, communication

525
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:38,291
and that's why you can't cover the water

526
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,208
and the sacred sites,

527
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:43,875
So I think GonawindÃºa is where life is.

528
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:47,208
And GonawindÃºa is an organization

529
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:50,541
Own, we cannot follow

530
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:53,541
Nor by making various organizations,

531
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:57,333
but that is the organization of the Big House.

532
00:27:57,416 --> 00:28:00,916
So I think I go down

533
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,791
GonawindÃºa

534
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:07,750
The thing is that we are here making a documentary, that is, actually directed

535
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:11,041
That's where a guy told me, that's where someone told me

536
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:14,125
that here what is going to speak is GonawindÃºa

537
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:18,416
with you, what we are going to film is with GonawindÃºa

538
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,250
then it is with GonawindÃºa

539
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,708
that we are documenting here, then

540
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,250
I think one day you

541
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:27,750
it's going to touch

542
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,791
climb GonawindÃºa itself to see it up there one day.

543
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:33,625
If this documentary doesn't turn out well,

544
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:36,333
We say that it puts its head or its paw.

545
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:40,083
Yes then well I think that's the message.

546
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:44,833
That's why in the mountains, everything ends there in Tayrona

547
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:47,875
XXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXX

548
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:50,625
and a Tayrona confederation

549
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:53,583
and the indigenous organization XXX

550
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:55,583
Because?

551
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:58,916
Because they are all mestizo, they lost their language

552
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:01,958
They lost habit, losing the hut.

553
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,583
They lost, they lost and they lost.

554
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:06,541
They are,

555
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:09,583
I imagine that 50 from now he has to recover.

556
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:12,916
If you put batteries in, well, if you don't put batteries in,

557
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,291
they will remain like this.

558
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,625
So I think that

559
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:19,000
that is GonawindÃºa and GonawindÃºa

560
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,708
That's life.

561
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:24,916
Life, better said, where the life of humanity is,

562
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:30,625
humanity, universal life.

563
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:32,208
So

564
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:36,416
I think that's GonawindÃºa.

565
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:44,083
If you can talk if we talk to the mamos a little,

566
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,291
but let's talk about the life of the breeze.

567
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:49,500
I know that was something that interested him.

568
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,750
But maybe you also have to listen as it is,

569
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:59,208
because before we were also told that well

570
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,791
The waters have no border, nor does the breeze there.

571
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:06,125
So it's a message to the world, right?

572
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:09,125
Maybe, then talk a little about

573
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,375
How is everything

574
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:13,458
connected with this place too, lest this

575
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:16,750
Place is not only here, in this heart of the world.

576
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,750
But it goes to everyone's door

577
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,541
who are going to see this documentary.

578
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:28,666
Let's see, I think

579
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:32,916
Without the breeze there would be no life,

580
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,375
So it is that while asleep we breathe,

581
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:40,458
asleep, we breathe, that is,

582
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:43,875
better said per second.

583
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:46,500
How do you save that breeze?

584
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,458
That too on the way

585
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:54,833
you can go without breathing,

586
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:56,750
that is, a path

587
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,083
where 100 indigenous people pass today

588
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:02,875
without breathing from here. 1 2 seconds,

589
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:07,166
three seconds, four seconds or four seconds.

590
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:11,333
The indigenous person who passes without breathing, saves,

591
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:14,125
save,

592
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:16,541
in a different way

593
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,625
to save it, like sometimes, like outside

594
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:22,833
They say, if the light goes out for a month about 20 minutes.

595
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:25,291
Does that save, they say no?

596
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:27,125
So

597
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:30,083
I think the breezes

598
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:36,416
It is in the physical,

599
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:39,458
It is in gonawindua .

600
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:42,916
There is a gap that blows a breeze

601
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:51,041
and

602
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:53,125
we say XXX,

603
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:57,666
XXX XXX

604
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,458
That is why it is very

605
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:03,791
partly as

606
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:07,541
talking, but you with the breeze, that is,

607
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:11,375
you are talking but with the breeze,

608
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:14,875
you are talking and you talk with the breeze,

609
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:18,541
but with the breeze he is going to start building.

610
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:21,583
Hey , let's make a documentary,

611
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:25,166
you start talking to the breeze, that is, and there

612
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:28,416
a documentary comes out.

613
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,916
So

614
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:32,833
everything is built

615
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:37,541
via XXXX.

616
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:40,416
The word.

617
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,166
If we are going to make some way,

618
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,708
we started talking here,

619
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:46,875
let's go to that road, let's do that, but with the breeze

620
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:51,916
you talk to XXX, with the shovel, with the XXXX

621
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and with that you build.

622
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,666
Yes, with the same word

623
00:32:56,666 --> 00:33:02,000
you build to do harm and you can do it,

624
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:06,625
with that same wind it can do damage,

625
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:08,625
and you can send it to do damage

626
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:09,541
when that breeze

627
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:13,458
comes, a tremendous breeze that comes

628
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:18,166
That breeze is coming. Every person who has done wrong

629
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:23,958
and that is the same thing that we send it, it does damage to things.

630
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:29,041
If we speak with a very nice positive

631
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:33,458
we make it a good wind,

632
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:38,291
That's almost what people don't understand.

633
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:42,000
but only those who can understand who is speaking.

634
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:45,041
That is, you are talking to the breeze,

635
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:47,916
that is, you sleep with the breeze.

636
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:50,833
For this reason it is essential

637
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:52,916
each society,

638
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:56,750
what you are going to talk, know how to talk,

639
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:59,041
because the great pollution,

640
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:03,000
great earthquake, great damage to

641
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,750
the same human, human spirit

642
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:09,541
The disaster is making him and he doesn't realize it,

643
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:12,625
He doesn't realize it with the word.

644
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:16,333
That is why the breeze almost that we see

645
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:19,416
it comes from the sea.

646
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,000
And others

647
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,375
They say that the breeze sometimes comes from the basin rolls.

648
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:28,375
They come from the lagoon,

649
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,250
but the breeze is

650
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:36,916
in each one, as a person.

651
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,458
Look, here I am,

652
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:42,416
here I am making a contribution with the breeze,

653
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:46,291
I'm saying it and that

654
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,791
The gentlemen there are listening to me,

655
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:52,000
No, this is very nice, you are contributing and they receive it

656
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:52,833
TRUE?

657
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:57,250
They arrive and find if they were sunbathing, look for shade,

658
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:58,833
Come on, look for the shadow,

659
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:02,291
We're going to sit there, I mean, look for the shade.

660
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:05,000
then a person

661
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,416
It has to continue casting shadows from there,

662
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,083
Because there is global warming there

663
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:13,666
and they need shadows.

664
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:18,333
Look, here we come and we are looking for the shadow,

665
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,291
bone the words

666
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:23,291
They say XXX, sit where it's cool,

667
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:27,583
look then when they talk about global warming

668
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:31,541
each person

669
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:34,208
see a shadow

670
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:37,666
so that they live cool.

671
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:41,291
But if you are very hot, you are very hot

672
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:43,958
because there they are dying,

673
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:45,833
Like global warming.

674
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:49,291
Outside science paints us otherwise,

675
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:51,208
very good, he tells us,

676
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:54,666
But the breeze is

677
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,583
breeze, it's asleep,

678
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:01,208
it is working and alive

679
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:04,083
is working.

680
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:06,916
If you cover yourself here,

681
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:09,000
has nothing to do.

682
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,708
So

683
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:13,041
in that same way it is that the hollow that is out there

684
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:16,708
We can't cover it because it has a connection.

685
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:20,333
a breeze is blowing

686
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:24,291
and another the breeze, what is already a breeze,

687
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:27,333
the gas that serves us, look at it

688
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:31,416
how we throw it away, the example is there

689
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,458
the gas.

690
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:37,875
So that's why that gas is

691
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:40,291
who recycles it,

692
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:41,166
recycles it

693
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:44,958
Positive words, is what the word

694
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:48,875
It rises and becomes a cloud

695
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:50,416
Bone becomes cloud.

696
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:55,666
And that's the beautiful thing we talk about in the

697
00:36:55,875 --> 00:37:01,125
the gas that is no longer used, you vote on what goes up

698
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:07,250
and recycles it again, and that's how human beings are,

699
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:10,125
the breeze starts down,

700
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:15,500
the breeze starts down, down to the sea

701
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:20,208
and on the moon the breeze begins upward.

702
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:22,875
So from noon onwards

703
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:26,458
until 11 at night there is already downstairs

704
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:31,583
I recycle them all, when I recycle them all

705
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:35,250
At 01:00 in the morning the breeze begins to rise towards the snow.

706
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:38,958
Then see how it works.

707
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:40,875
So

708
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:41,625
one thing

709
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:42,541
It's counting the breeze

710
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:46,791
It has a sacred site and another thing is to say the breeze is

711
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,958
each.

712
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:52,916
Here we must play with the breeze,

713
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,208
not so much the words, keep voting

714
00:37:56,208 --> 00:38:00,125
the air negative, negative, negative, negative, negative.

715
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:02,000
All pensive negative.

716
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,666
Well, that's what global warming takes away.

717
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:09,458
You argue with the breeze, with son,

718
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:11,500
you discuss breeze with your mom,

719
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,708
you discuss breeze between government, government.

720
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:18,875
You breeze argue with your son-in-law, with your wife.

721
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:22,416
Then look, everything is getting contaminated there.

722
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:24,333
second by second.

723
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,666
And that's what people don't realize.

724
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:28,791
Then look at the good one.

725
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:31,750
A good, good atmosphere, good

726
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:35,083
good environment, in the middle

727
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:38,166
We must have 90% positive.

728
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:42,291
Yes, but that's in every

729
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:45,041
person, in each one,

730
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:48,833
from the largest, from the smallest, from the mamo.

731
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:50,500
Yes, the mamo too.

732
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,333
If the breeze is bouncing very negatively,

733
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:56,125
Well, work is being very negative.

734
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,750
From the bishop, from the Pope, from the other, from the other.

735
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:03,125
And that is, if there is understanding

736
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:05,708
the breeze itself will carry us,

737
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:07,083
the breeze itself

738
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:09,000
can't stand the words there

739
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,958
if the air does not take us to other planets.

740
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:17,375
If then here I tell you in the world, in the world,

741
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:21,750
let's know global warming

742
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:25,750
It is not that so much damage is done, but it is

743
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:29,333
the same words, the same we speak.

744
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:33,041
One speaks, look, global warming is,

745
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:36,666
makes it... the one who has the most say, with the most money

746
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:37,583
has, with more

747
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:41,291
has, they call and say the word, has

748
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:44,541
The parable I do whatever, whatever I want.

749
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:48,625
So I think that here we should be more

750
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:52,958
It's like the attitude,

751
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,375
have each one their individual attitude

752
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,375
and that the attitude should be,

753
00:39:58,375 --> 00:39:59,625
but the other in the world

754
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:01,916
you have to have the spiritual attitude.

755
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:03,875
When the lady is

756
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:06,875
pregnant, you must from there until it is the child

757
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:09,750
give him education from there.

758
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,458
If you don't have an education from there,

759
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:13,625
the child is born here,

760
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:16,250
for it will live as a total negative breeze.

761
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,125
So I think that in the world

762
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:23,541
we must also the attitude, the attitude,

763
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:27,666
family, attitude with the partner,

764
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:32,166
the attitude towards diversity,

765
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,833
the attitude with the frog

766
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:37,125
with cricket, behavior.

767
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:38,708
If there is no attitude

768
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:43,208
a change in attitude towards nature, since this

769
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:47,208
also the attitude does not change, otherwise the punishment will come

770
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:50,833
from them. So I think the breezes

771
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:55,750
I tell you that the breeze is in you.

772
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:59,250
If you want to be a leader like this tree,

773
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:03,083
Everyone, come on, leave there fresh,

774
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:05,833
A leader has to be from a shadow

775
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:09,666
big, human has to be a big shadow,

776
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,500
so that everyone comes fresh, bathed

777
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:14,791
and from there he leaves happy.

778
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:19,541
And it turns out that a leader isâ¦ a leader

779
00:41:19,541 --> 00:41:22,000
without this it is nothing.

780
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,791
So I guess that's the breeze

781
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:26,833
Yeah.

782
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:59,416
then well we have already talked about a lot of this

783
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,500
with others,

784
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:04,875
but maybe,

785
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:08,625
well, maybe you could talk a little about devolution

786
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:12,291
of sacred objects here.

787
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:19,041
xxxx .

788
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:23,125
Well I think

789
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:26,916
return,

790
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
one without a child there is no strength.

791
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:32,666
Childless.

792
00:42:32,666 --> 00:42:34,708
Any force needs

793
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:38,708
union, the community.

794
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:42,250
So I think that the return,

795
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:44,583
my dream is that one day

796
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:47,583
The world must be made to understand this,

797
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:51,375
the return, both in the clay pot,

798
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:58,416
so much quartz, so much gold, so much and so much and so much

799
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,208
that's the object

800
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:03,958
Indian is condemned, he is kidnapped,

801
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:06,583
is kidnapped,

802
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:10,916
the gold that has gold from dolls of all kinds or India

803
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:15,791
The outside world takes it and they use a necklace, they use a thing.

804
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:19,875
because he doesn't know the consequences.

805
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:22,875
So I do believe that you have to be a teacher.

806
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:25,875
in the world for the world to become a teacher,

807
00:43:26,041 --> 00:43:29,375
not only the object in Colombia,

808
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:31,208
but

809
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:35,041
every state, every country

810
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:37,750
The object is not stolen.

811
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,375
o india lies gold museum

812
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:43,750
or India I find it.

813
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:44,458
Some day.

814
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:46,208
able

815
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:48,041
that the object

816
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:53,208
I must return to its origins,

817
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:55,958
Well, this or a lot or India can look like a

818
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:57,541
laugh, right?

819
00:43:57,541 --> 00:43:59,333
But

820
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:03,875
We must do this by returning them to their origins.

821
00:44:03,958 --> 00:44:05,250
Suddenly with the president of

822
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,250
Right now President Gustavo Petro

823
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:11,666
One thing has already been given, the mask,

824
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:12,791
the return of the

825
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:16,916
Germany surrendered, surrendered

826
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:20,333
and I think the president is going to help him a lot,

827
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:23,750
That mask is going to help him.

828
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:28,250
It will help his family a lot

829
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:32,083
let them criticize you, let them tell you, let them tell you,

830
00:44:32,166 --> 00:44:36,250
but that mask is going to help him a lot

831
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:40,250
and he will protect him greatly in his life and in his death.

832
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:44,458
And he will do it, because that mask that he feels today

833
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:49,083
It was a kidnapping of more than 100 years, kidnapped

834
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:52,708
and the man has brought from there and brings here,

835
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:55,000
It's a liberation

836
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,375
It's a release from life.

837
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:00,250
and it will help you a lot,

838
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:03,250
All his life, until his death, he will help him.

839
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:06,958
Both his children and children.

840
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:10,125
So I think that

841
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,166
that is already an example.

842
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:14,791
This example must be reported

843
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:17,500
Worldwide,

844
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,666
not just that mask.

845
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:22,666
Today we need the return of the dolls

846
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:24,958
things from the taironas,

847
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:28,000
not only in the mountains, but throughout Colombia,

848
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:29,208
indigenous people.

849
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:33,416
Thus they lost their object, the other countries

850
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,666
of the indigenous people,

851
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:35,625
that also

852
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:38,958
It is located today in Rome, it is located whereâ¦

853
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:41,375
So I think the message is

854
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:46,208
These objects are not evolutionary, it is not for us to have,

855
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:52,416
If not, that object is the force so that, for the water,

856
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,041
for the air, for something else, something else,

857
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:56,041
another thing is harvest

858
00:45:56,041 --> 00:45:59,250
the water, the water so that I have to return it

859
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:03,083
that they are condemned, kidnapped.

860
00:46:03,166 --> 00:46:05,916
The dream is someday

861
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,708
that has been returned

862
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:11,750
to its origins, when

863
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:14,583
global warming

864
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:17,041
it is spoken, the people study.

865
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:17,916
Those are those

866
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:21,833
global warming that has them condemned there.

867
00:46:21,916 --> 00:46:22,916
For the world outside

868
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:25,958
He believes that one is a piece of wood that does not speak.

869
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:27,291
That's for us

870
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:31,416
a swallow, it is a speech, it has a life.

871
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,291
So

872
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:36,708
I think I just want to say here

873
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:39,458
the example seen in the mask with

874
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:43,500
the current president who brought from Germany,

875
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:46,416
The other presidents who come will continue

876
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:50,000
that one exposed, also that president,

877
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,083
I think in history

878
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:53,250
He's going to be the president here.

879
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,416
and the president of Germany are an example,

880
00:46:56,416 --> 00:46:59,750
that we will have them bet

881
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:02,833
like the Colombian president and the German president

882
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,333
if he could

883
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:06,458
voluntarily deliver,

884
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:09,541
It wasn't through the chancellor, but it didn't stay, no,

885
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:12,750
If not immediately, they delivered it.

886
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:15,583
So those I believe that example of the Lord

887
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:18,583
President of Germany and Colombia

888
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:22,041
one day, which happens, we can continue advising

889
00:47:22,041 --> 00:47:26,083
of it, how they achieved it, how it, how they delivered it,

890
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:31,250
how not so much difficulty was achieved and given and returned.

891
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:33,083
This will remain as a witness,

892
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:38,250
example for life, then I think

893
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:39,083
is, those

894
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:42,833
These are things that I think speak a lot about return.

895
00:47:42,916 --> 00:47:45,541
when that return starts to speak

896
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:49,291
possession, how they are going to have it.

897
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:51,041
No, we are going to have it,

898
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,125
tenure is

899
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:53,166
or where they caught him,

900
00:47:53,166 --> 00:47:55,000
You have to bury it or you have to save it.

901
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,708
There is life, but life begins, annoying, possession

902
00:47:58,791 --> 00:48:01,416
and the Attorney General's Office has to be watching.

903
00:48:01,416 --> 00:48:04,416
You know if one doesn't even understand

904
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:08,458
like that, but look at it.

905
00:48:08,541 --> 00:48:10,000
What is the dream of us

906
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,541
some day?

907
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:14,083
We believe the city was lost, the world outside says lost,

908
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:15,208
of course, for us

909
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:16,833
had, must be lost,

910
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:20,250
moss, plants tucked in, that had to be lost.

911
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:21,708
Then they so lost

912
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:22,416
they found him.

913
00:48:22,416 --> 00:48:26,375
Yes, the dream will someday be lost again,

914
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:28,000
be lost again, be filled with

915
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,791
mountains.

916
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,375
Once when they proposed it to me

917
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:33,833
I said no, not like that

918
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:37,291
Because that is a prosecutor's office and it watches over the outside world.

919
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:44,791
Well, look, then I think that in the return it is

920
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:47,083
volunteer,

921
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:50,708
Individual, family, than in the hotel

922
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:55,958
They have a handle, everyone uses a chain, a handle,

923
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,791
everyone change their attitude,

924
00:48:59,875 --> 00:49:02,875
May they return that to mother earth.

925
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:05,583
This has to be involuntary,

926
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:07,750
in Santa Marta some volunteer,

927
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:10,750
someone came to bring me the handle,

928
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:14,375
You brought it to me, sir, here it is.

929
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:16,000
And a child doesn't keep that either,

930
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,333
This goes to the earth.

931
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:22,208
So I think the return, we believe

932
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:25,958
that the return is not an object,

933
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:29,875
but, in the eyes,

934
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:31,666
return

935
00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:35,708
We want that not only in Colombia, but throughout the world

936
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:38,750
return it to its origins,

937
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:42,541
to the objects of mother Earth.

938
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:46,750
and thus return the kidnapped children to Mother Earth

939
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:50,083
It would be a happiness for them, a happy one.

940
00:49:50,166 --> 00:49:53,500
No matter what state of many years you are happy with them.

941
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:55,458
That is the return.

942
00:49:57,625 --> 00:49:59,166
Good .

943
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:01,333
What

944
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:05,291
almost everything he told me before that he wanted to talk about

945
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:08,208
and investigate

946
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:09,541
well, but I don't know

947
00:50:09,541 --> 00:50:12,458
you personally

948
00:50:12,458 --> 00:50:13,666
how is your connection,

949
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:17,708
What is your relationship with the earth, with nature,

950
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:20,916
how it has evolved

951
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,875
or changed, or what that relationship is like.

952
00:50:24,916 --> 00:50:27,458
like my person

953
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:31,166
Either everything or as a person.

954
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,541
As a person and also for everything.

955
00:50:33,541 --> 00:50:34,958
Let's see.

956
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:47,916
Well I think

957
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:50,625
It's one thing to talk about generality,

958
00:50:50,625 --> 00:50:54,000
another thing to talk about the community, another thing

959
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:58,625
to talk about family and something else to live is

960
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:01,708
individual.

961
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:05,375
So I think that

962
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:05,958
to be

963
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:09,750
a ruler, a ruler,

964
00:51:09,791 --> 00:51:12,750
I must have all the connections

965
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,625
spiritual,

966
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:17,041
one thing suddenly

967
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:20,208
have a connection to the Interior Ministry, the mayor, that is

968
00:51:20,208 --> 00:51:22,000
another thing,

969
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:25,125
but another thing is the connection

970
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:29,458
to the principles of holding a position,

971
00:51:29,541 --> 00:51:32,333
to govern, to command,

972
00:51:32,333 --> 00:51:36,875
because you know how to live on top of people,

973
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:41,375
that is, one criticizes him, the other well,

974
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:44,625
so the majority criticize him,

975
00:51:44,708 --> 00:51:47,000
but one knows

976
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,166
cultural thing is that it was going to be positive.

977
00:51:50,166 --> 00:51:53,166
always had criticism

978
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:56,125
For the majority, it was negative,

979
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:59,125
but anyway, if one was

980
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:02,125
the fight for a good life,

981
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:04,166
for a good life,

982
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:06,083
good living, the fight

983
00:52:06,083 --> 00:52:09,083
It was not my person, the fight is not personal to one,

984
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:13,375
The struggle is of the people, the struggle of origins.

985
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:15,958
But many people make mistakes when they fight.

986
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:18,958
It seems like it was a personal struggle,

987
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:22,625
there is a leader who can make mistakes,

988
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:25,291
It can be almost personal,

989
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:27,541
but my fight is not personal.

990
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:31,166
The collective struggle, the family struggle,

991
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:34,541
the fight for Mother Earth.

992
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:36,708
So,

993
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:39,666
I think my connection

994
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:42,333
both here human and connection

995
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:45,791
with nature,

996
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:48,916
I know I have to head under them,

997
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,500
under their direction

998
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,291
and another part a little

999
00:52:53,291 --> 00:52:55,875
know the outside address too.

1000
00:52:55,875 --> 00:52:58,875
I don't have much from outside,

1001
00:52:58,916 --> 00:53:02,250
but inside I do have almost 90%.

1002
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:04,916
Have clarity,

1003
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:08,416
That's why I don't get so contaminated from outside, it doesn't leave me,

1004
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:12,291
I don't let myself be dragged from outside, I don't poison myself

1005
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:16,333
from outside. No, the money doesn't poison me.

1006
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:17,291
Because?

1007
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:18,583
Don't know.

1008
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:20,833
On the court a lot,

1009
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:23,500
the court is inwards a lot.

1010
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,458
For that very reason,

1011
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:27,833
I have worked for years and years and

1012
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:30,958
I have never had a problem with resources

1013
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:34,083
because I don't contaminate myself, I don't crave that.

1014
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:39,250
What I crave is on an internal level,

1015
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:40,750
I don't feel like it,

1016
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,458
That's why I don't fill myself with things, car,

1017
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:43,500
I don't fill anything,

1018
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:47,458
I don't even fill a pretty hat, that is, I don't fill myself if it's not...

1019
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:49,958
I fill myself with internal things.

1020
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:50,458
That is

1021
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:53,666
A leader who does not have problems has to live

1022
00:53:53,666 --> 00:53:56,666
well, craving for cultural

1023
00:53:56,708 --> 00:54:00,416
You will never have a problem with the external world,

1024
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:02,541
better said, have

1025
00:54:02,541 --> 00:54:06,291
90 percent contaminated from inside

1026
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:10,000
and from the outside like one having 20% contaminated from the outside.

1027
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,041
Of course, it is also contaminated.

1028
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:13,625
Yeah.

1029
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:17,708
So I think my connections

1030
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:21,083
it is with what, with the principles

1031
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:23,583
and

1032
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:25,958
and the connections

1033
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:29,166
not only how to say them, but live it

1034
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:32,500
and practice it, exercise them,

1035
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:36,875
not like living them or indigenous, not living my language with hair,

1036
00:54:36,916 --> 00:54:39,625
my clothes, don't wear them

1037
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:43,333
not from the heart, but within the heart.

1038
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:45,333
Because there is an indigenous person who exercises

1039
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:48,916
only from outside, from the clothes, the language,

1040
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,791
Yes, not my person,

1041
00:54:51,791 --> 00:54:56,250
nor is it from the heart above, but inside the heart.

1042
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:59,291
Being the Indian is within the heart, not the clothes,

1043
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:04,125
not from the language, it is not from the hair, but it is from within the heart.

1044
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:08,166
And so I think that after one fights

1045
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:10,833
inside their hearts,

1046
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:14,208
you are going to achieve everything because you are achieving it.

1047
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:17,541
In fact, for that very reason

1048
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:20,958
this documentation that when I talk to you,

1049
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:22,333
the documentation is there.

1050
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:25,041
We wanted to do it inside the heart,

1051
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:29,041
not outside the heart, but inside.

1052
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:33,250
So I think that well

1053
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,041
every ruler

1054
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,875
you should know it

1055
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:40,541
inside the heart,

1056
00:55:40,541 --> 00:55:43,916
This way the things outside will not contaminate you much,

1057
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,875
even if they drag you in the face and smear you

1058
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:50,291
everything is fine, even if it drags you,

1059
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:53,583
they anoint you, they make you, but you are protected,

1060
00:55:53,666 --> 00:55:57,500
It is shielded like 90% of its culture.

1061
00:55:57,583 --> 00:55:59,208
Whatever you do.

1062
00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:02,000
Yes, for that reason

1063
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,708
our security has to be inside,

1064
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:08,791
If we don't get to this, we start to have people,

1065
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:11,958
outside security, weapons

1066
00:56:12,041 --> 00:56:15,083
Start protecting yourself, that is

1067
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:18,166
that we can reach a limit, that is,

1068
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:21,833
It is already a figure from outside, walking with weapons

1069
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:26,125
next to one and that is what we should not reach,

1070
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:30,791
if it is not to have with the protections, with the spiritual,

1071
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:33,875
Yes, good behavior with them,

1072
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:37,416
so i think

1073
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,458
Well, I think about 20 years from now

1074
00:56:41,541 --> 00:56:45,875
I will continue fighting with the people. and what are the others?

1075
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:48,500
My ,

1076
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,333
my profession that I have today.

1077
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:52,958
This is not from the university,

1078
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:55,958
but of a profession of the,

1079
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:59,833
of the mountains, of nature.

1080
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,125
My design that I make,

1081
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:05,041
I designed my own

1082
00:57:05,041 --> 00:57:08,625
and all this is my will

1083
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:12,833
When I was studying, a boy was a leader.

1084
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:17,833
Lead in school, you do this, you do this, yeah.

1085
00:57:17,916 --> 00:57:22,125
So I think the fight

1086
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:24,708
It has to be a natural struggle.

1087
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,625
The struggle,

1088
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:29,916
one thing is a profession, being a document, a paper

1089
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,125
and another thing is to do natural fighting.

1090
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:38,333
You have to start doing like some math,

1091
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:42,333
because one ruler, one being a mathematician,

1092
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:43,583
mathematical.

1093
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:46,916
You add, you subtract, you split it, you take it away.

1094
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,041
And I'm a mathematician, I just do math.

1095
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:56,291
I know how to subtract less, take away, add to them, make them.

1096
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,916
A teacher has to be a good mathematician, yes,

1097
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,208
because if you are not a mathematician,

1098
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:04,875
Well, you have to keep looking for someone else to help you,

1099
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:08,125
otherwise you have to start being your mathematicians

1100
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:09,875
and then

1101
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:12,875
I think that culturally there is also that mathematics,

1102
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,750
yes play, propose and guide.

1103
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:21,958
Yes, well, I think those are things.

1104
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:26,125
More cultural connections, that is.

1105
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:27,583
I think from here

1106
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:29,958
After a thousand years the Kogi people have to continue

1107
00:58:29,958 --> 00:58:32,958
that, that expectation still.

1108
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:37,000
So that's why I believe that this, all of this

1109
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,166
what we are talking about, youth like that has to start from that,

1110
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:42,500
because one will continue to be the teacher, for them

1111
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,708
He is still the teacher.

1112
00:58:43,708 --> 00:58:48,000
All this documentary is going to be for the youth,

1113
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:53,041
so that's it.

1114
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:06,083
It has to start from life, no,

1115
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:07,583
but you can almost do it

1116
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:11,083
Approach, approach.

1117
00:59:11,166 --> 00:59:13,625
How to build them?

1118
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:16,500
I believe that, through dialogue,

1119
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,625
that is, get closer

1120
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:21,416
how to build it, presence,

1121
00:59:21,416 --> 00:59:25,291
Know the spaces and get closer.

1122
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:28,583
And then, the most enjoyable thing,

1123
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:31,208
how to have a documentary

1124
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:33,791
and another a small pamphlet,

1125
00:59:33,791 --> 00:59:38,041
that is, something that remains as being built.

1126
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:40,500
But another thing to build is,

1127
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,875
I think that everyone outside

1128
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:46,875
It is the essence of life, of diversity.

1129
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:49,500
Here this world no one can be

1130
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,500
here language, we change customs, different,

1131
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:55,416
but the seed we are from the earth,

1132
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:57,416
the seeds are from the water,

1133
00:59:57,416 --> 01:00:01,000
the seed of the essence is, we are only one,

1134
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:04,041
but here in custom is that we differ

1135
01:00:04,166 --> 01:00:08,375
in language, in custom, but the essence is one,

1136
01:00:08,416 --> 01:00:11,416
the water that civilians drink,

1137
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:14,000
the water you drink, that same essence

1138
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,041
It is what one sows seeds, that same one, that same one.

1139
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:21,083
There are no indifferences, there is no difference.

1140
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:25,500
So I do believe that how we should build it,

1141
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:28,083
We have to talk, everyone

1142
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:32,125
water, all food we consume, that same

1143
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:37,458
is that the child becomes, look, the child,

1144
01:00:37,541 --> 01:00:40,041
but the use, the handling

1145
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:43,291
Of course, the indigenous applies differently, a payment,

1146
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:48,291
and the world outside applies through a

1147
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:50,000
the religion,

1148
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,791
also the gods themselves, yes.

1149
01:00:52,791 --> 01:00:55,750
So I think that

1150
01:00:55,875 --> 01:00:58,500
the most critical thing how we build,

1151
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,958
changing attitude in life.

1152
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:03,250
Attitude,

1153
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,958
Yeah.

1154
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:07,041
How do we build?

1155
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:10,000
Water does not build water once,

1156
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,875
the breeze does not build once, so

1157
01:01:14,958 --> 01:01:20,083
It is how we build through spiritual work.

1158
01:01:20,166 --> 01:01:21,958
Concentrating. Yeah.

1159
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:25,833
So I think that these little paths here

1160
01:01:25,833 --> 01:01:28,500
we are looking ahead

1161
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,500
we can almost remain as something

1162
01:01:31,541 --> 01:01:35,125
built, not total, but a common path,

1163
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:38,375
We can achieve a common path.

1164
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:40,208
To continue betting,

1165
01:01:40,208 --> 01:01:42,541
so that you must return later master.

1166
01:01:42,541 --> 01:01:46,208
No matter how indigenous you are, you count

1167
01:01:46,291 --> 01:01:50,416
So. To be indigenous you have to build

1168
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:54,333
one long path because if you don't build they get tangled

1169
01:01:54,416 --> 01:01:55,250
over there.

1170
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:59,041
Yes, they said what and when they say

1171
01:01:59,041 --> 01:02:03,375
They said that they are, almost that you are not involved in it,

1172
01:02:03,416 --> 01:02:07,041
knowing that they don't, water is one,

1173
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:10,583
the breeze is one, the sun is one, lagoon

1174
01:02:10,583 --> 01:02:14,083
It is one, all civil, humanity

1175
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:19,541
Be it gringo or whoever, in life we are one, it is one,

1176
01:02:19,625 --> 01:02:20,041
because it

1177
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:23,041
Gringo also drinks water and the same essence.

1178
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:25,750
All semen is from nature,

1179
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:28,958
It must be said this way, simply, without giving it too much thought.

1180
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:30,791
And so it is, we are one.

1181
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:32,958
What differentiates us is the language,

1182
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:35,208
the custom, the clothing.

1183
01:02:35,208 --> 01:02:37,208
It's what makes the difference

1184
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:39,833
but the bet is one.
