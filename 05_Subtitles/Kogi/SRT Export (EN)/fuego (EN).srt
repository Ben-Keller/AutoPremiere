1
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:08,000
They come out

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,791
mountains, drawing graphics

3
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:16,708
and

4
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:20,208
from xxxx.

5
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:22,250
And is it natural for it to look like that?

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,291
It's natural

7
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,208
And is that type of piece used?

8
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,708
That's the type that

9
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,375
is used to,

10
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,541
for poporeo .

11
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,875
This one too.

12
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,291
This is also used for popping.

13
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:38,083
And it takes a little while to burn,

14
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:41,083
this is very fragile

15
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,083
and is pulverized

16
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,583
fast.

17
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:48,208
So do you make a lime or how does that work?

18
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,458
Yes it makes a lime

19
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:53,291
And then when burning,

20
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,958
put in a container

21
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,250
and begins to evaporate,

22
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,666
washes it with hot water, with cold water

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,791
and

24
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,833
then

25
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,958
They put it in a container,

26
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:11,458
It can be a clay pot or a metal pot,

27
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,541
something airtight

28
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:17,833
and then it starts to evaporate by itself.

29
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:20,791
When it cools, it is pulverized.

30
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:23,250
It is the procedure alone,

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,875
does not contain chemicals or

32
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:31,375
add nothing, just burn

33
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,916
and then put…

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,625
you can say evaporate.

35
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,500
And

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,916
How does that interact with the sheet?

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,250
And then with the leaf it is toasted in a clay pot,

38
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,750
is completely dehydrated, no longer

39
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,041
the taste of green is felt

40
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:58,083
and then that's it

41
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,375
we put in the mouth

42
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:10,666
and in these pores

43
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,541
well

44
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,250
we extract

45
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,583
the lime with the stick,

46
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,875
an amount that does not harm the lip

47
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,250
because salt is very strong.

48
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,250
If I put it like that, it bothers me.

49
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,708
So

50
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:32,583
I take out a quantity and on the sheet

51
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,791
What do I have there with saliva?

52
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,458
and I am forming

53
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,291
different.

54
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,125
And that way, each one is different?

55
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:43,666
It grows,

56
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,458
then

57
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,250
starts to cover all the saliva

58
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:54,416
the mixture, the green comes out of the leaf

59
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,291
with lime,

60
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,750
comes out like thick saliva

61
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,333
and the wet stick and

62
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,375
with that

63
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,708
he leaves, as they say,

64
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:09,875
well, like painting.

65
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,250
And that's the action you're doing there?

66
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,541
Action, yes

67
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:18,250
and that forms layers and grows

68
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:22,083
Does it have a meaning in the form?

69
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:25,125
or does everyone have their own definition?

70
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,875
Each one then,

71
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,166
the meaning,

72
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,333
it is like

73
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,250
everything that is concentrated,

74
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,583
knowledge in spirit when as

75
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:37,166
For example,

76
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:42,250
When mom is teaching, then one is pooping

77
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:46,625
and then it is greater concentration

78
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,708
Well, one is focused on the poporo

79
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:53,750
and does not pay attention to what is happening in the environment.

80
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:58,375
So for us what is being formed

81
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01,416
here is how we are weaving

82
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:05,708
and messing around there, writing

83
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,583
and that makes us

84
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,208
Since all our knowledge is oral,

85
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:14,833
then it makes things stick in our minds,

86
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,875
what the eldest says

87
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,458
or the mom.

88
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,666
Since we don't write,

89
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:24,375
helps us have better

90
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,666
hearing, concentration.

91
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,166
AND

92
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,541
when turning

93
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,250
or how to paint

94
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,291
then it helps us

95
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:42,250
that our spirit or our hearing, the thought,

96
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,333
the view works and

97
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,666
develops better.

98
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,958
When a mother teaches wisdom

99
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,833
Pray then help him

100
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,875
why that

101
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:00,750
stay in one.

102
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:01,958
And so

103
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:05,791
It's like the importance of poporo.

104
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,083
But initially at

105
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:14,375
Guys, it is only for use by men and at the age

106
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:18,458
more or less 16, 17 years old

107
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,208
that normally because the height

108
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:25,125
arrives,

109
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:25,833
I already know

110
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,333
deliver the poporo.

111
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,375
Did the mother

112
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,333
do you prepare?

113
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,375
On an empty stomach

114
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,083
like four days in

115
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,583
fasting and then

116
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,041
they're taking us

117
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,000
to a cave

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,125
and

119
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:55,125
there all the time

120
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,583
makes us like

121
00:05:56,583 --> 00:06:00,291
pass on all the information

122
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,583
or the inventory to the mother,

123
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:06,333
except good and bad things we have done in life.

124
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,750
So that's what

125
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,041
in Spanish they call confesso.

126
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,916
But

127
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:14,583
is

128
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,708
report to the mother everything

129
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:20,000
one has developed in life

130
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:23,666
and to have a clean spirit.

131
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,666
and

132
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:28,166
then receive the knowledge of the mamos

133
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,916
which are already positive knowledge,

134
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,916
I mean what you will become

135
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:37,500
as a man, as a person and what

136
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:41,041
will do from now on in your life, in your decision,

137
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,875
in what you want to develop.

138
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,541
If you want to be a mom, or

139
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:50,208
wants to be a builder, field worker,

140
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,833
then one is prepared to receive all

141
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:57,625
that knowledge, or rather the initiation.

142
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,708
It's already starting

143
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:04,333
the stage in the life of a man, of responsibility,

144
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,666
because we live all the time

145
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:13,208
in the hands of our parents.

146
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:13,666
Without

147
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,250
depend on oneself,

148
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,625
the parents are the

149
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:20,041
in charge of ensuring that nothing happens to him,

150
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:24,166
protects them, feeds us, gives us clothes,

151
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:29,000
knowledge, advice, cared

152
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:32,625
so that nature does not charge us,

153
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:36,125
then they are the ones who are pending all their lives,

154
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:40,500
but we are already entering the adult stage,

155
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,875
where life will depend on you.

156
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:46,083
Then they train us

157
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,666
of four days,

158
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,666
It depends on the consultation seven, eight days.

159
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,541
So it's a little strict

160
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:58,083
upon receiving support.

161
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,291
Usually

162
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,625
are

163
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,625
fasting, you have to fast

164
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,833
and stay up late,

165
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:12,500
not sleeping four nights in a row.

166
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:16,541
And there are people who have a strong spirit

167
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:20,958
and are able to resist and other young people

168
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,250
they can't do it,

169
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,458
they do not resist.

170
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:29,666
It means that that person is going to have a lot of conflict.

171
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:36,375
and will not be able to level things in life.

172
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:36,791
It's not

173
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:40,625
Sad, it's like proof that the mamos do.

174
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:45,291
It is not the mamos if it does not taste that of nature.

175
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,083
Personally when I

176
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:51,625
They did that ceremony for me, I didn't have a problem with that.

177
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,500
Already.

178
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,208
There were humans called

179
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,541
Mamo santos from xxxx

180
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,666
One of the wisest mamos,

181
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,083
important, one of the last ones rather and one of them

182
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:12,625
He was the one who gave me that initiation, very strict,

183
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:16,750
but I passed that test without any problem.

184
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,750
I mean,

185
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:24,541
late night fasting at night and late night fasting

186
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:28,750
Well, what's going on there? each night

187
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:32,416
long a wise

188
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,500
is teaching him,

189
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:39,916
He is teaching you the law of origin.

190
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:45,083
All creation begins from creation

191
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:49,458
and all night listen, listen

192
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,083
and

193
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:56,375
I did not have any problem.

194
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,458
And since this is good,

195
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,625
after I put that in, can you tell me

196
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,083
what is the creation belief?

197
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:16,458
What is the creation?

198
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:21,000
The creation?

199
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,708
Active.

200
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:26,625
May the younger brother

201
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,416
called

202
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,791
xxxx

203
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,291
or mythology,

204
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:38,166
but more than mythology

205
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,625
Xxxx it could be something

206
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,833
as belief

207
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:48,000
or something that is real or unreal,

208
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,625
but for us

209
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:57,291
It is the beginning of life, the beginning of life.

210
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,041
Everything has an explanation,

211
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:03,833
just as science manages to explain things.

212
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:07,583
Our science explains.

213
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,541
Let's say,

214
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:14,583
the mamos explain how it was created

215
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:19,000
the universe.

216
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,916
When they explain,

217
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:24,750
They explain in the following way, they say that

218
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:28,166
first, before existing

219
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,416
The material,

220
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,250
there was nothing, it was

221
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,458
water and night.

222
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,416
That's how it started.

223
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,500
But the water

224
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,541
The water was not as such as today,

225
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,541
but the spirit, that is, nothing.

226
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:54,125
That is, from nothing it began to be created

227
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,208
on the moon.

228
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,958
That is why the expression, the word

229
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:02,083
moon comes from that foundation

230
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,375
then there was no water,

231
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,958
There was no sun, no stars,

232
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,625
there were no plants.

233
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,583
First mother xxxx,

234
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:17,291
and father xxxx began to,

235
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,333
in spirit

236
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,041
to create everything that was going to be

237
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,041
the earth, the planet.

238
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,541
Who were our grandparents

239
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,291
before

240
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,208
the first spirits that

241
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,666
gave creation.

242
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,541
Then

243
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,583
they

244
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:42,333
They assigned the work to the children,

245
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:46,416
to father xxxx, to this one

246
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,500
He ordered him to organize the land,

247
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:54,083
That is why he was called the father of the earth,

248
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,958
Xxxx, father of life,

249
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,708
I say about living beings,

250
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:04,166
of the nature.

251
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,250
The father xxxx,

252
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,250
he ordered him

253
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,041
the law of origin.

254
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,458
That they will organize everything that is

255
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,500
spiritual mountains

256
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,166
with temples.

257
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,416
Order

258
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,166
the law

259
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,458
spiritual.

260
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,750
The xxxx father that is

261
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,416
of the most

262
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,750
powerful who dominates all wisdom

263
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,833
complete of the mother,

264
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,291
ordered him as

265
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:42,625
keep that wisdom,

266
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,000
organize well

267
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,708
and leave each code in nature.

268
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:52,208
Therefore, father xxxx

269
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,458
knows everything,

270
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,291
knows what the law of stone is like,

271
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,125
the law of people, the law of plants.

272
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,750
He knows,

273
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,916
We asked him what the law is like and he explained it to you.

274
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,833
how to take care of yourself, he explains.

275
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:11,500
That is what the law of origin is, rather

276
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:15,041
imagine it as if it were a book,

277
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,958
that his mother wrote to him

278
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:24,083
and they applied it just as the mother indicated.

279
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:24,958
That's why they are the creators,

280
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,375
likewise mothers, mother

281
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,791
What are they

282
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,958
Xxxx, what

283
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,708
it is the Earth,

284
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,750
the fertile land,

285
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:43,666
the task also of ordering so that

286
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:48,000
there would be life

287
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:51,625
And they talk about mothers,

288
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:56,458
They talk about nine mothers in colors of the earth,

289
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,541
white earth, reddish earth,

290
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,666
sandy land

291
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,541
and well, wisdom explains that each land

292
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:10,541
It has a function.

293
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,083
AND

294
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,666
which is more

295
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:19,708
valuable that gave life in was the black, fertile earth.

296
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,041
AND

297
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,666
in that creation

298
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:28,166
They were spirits,

299
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:28,583
people.

300
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,500
It has its narrative.

301
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,291
When parents xxxx

302
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:38,375
They asked him to organize the land with her,

303
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,291
the story says so xxxx because of the color

304
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:46,500
He didn't like it, I mean the black, black, but

305
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,583
He liked the white ones,

306
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,458
cute

307
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,291
So

308
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,291
the black earth,

309
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:01,000
the Pope, well, a spiritual being,

310
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,333
He picked it up and put it away.

311
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:09,625
in depths because I knew that after

312
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:13,166
work with the other earth colors

313
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,916
I was going to need it because the others

314
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
they had functions for certain

315
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
things, but they weren't

316
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
perfect for organizing the territory,

317
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:30,125
for life they were not perfect.

318
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,625
And when all that happened

319
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,625
he realized that

320
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,291
the black earth was necessary,

321
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:43,625
but it cost him a lot to be able to

322
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,541
bring him

323
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,041
and other spiritual beings,

324
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:52,750
how xxxx helped him rescue

325
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,500
from where I was through wisdom,

326
00:16:56,583 --> 00:17:02,958
but we are talking about spiritual beings.

327
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:06,333
In this way the law of origin

328
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,208
or creation as they say,

329
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,708
explain, the mamo explain

330
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:18,625
and then dawn, there was no day

331
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:22,291
and when he was born there was Father Sol

332
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,166
xxxx

333
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:28,000
well the sun

334
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,333
of the night

335
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:34,958
and after that xxxx was born

336
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,541
which is now the sun,

337
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:41,666
was born here on earth.

338
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,375
And then

339
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,250
Mother

340
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,541
He placed it in the center

341
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:54,250
and that's when it's already dawn and when it's dawn

342
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,541
everything that had been created in spirit

343
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:03,333
materialized.

344
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,750
Then they would wonder

345
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,750
How so in spirit?

346
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,458
That's why we humans,

347
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,416
before

348
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,833
do recording work,

349
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:19,833
think first, feel, first

350
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,333
start to feel,

351
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,375
does not speak it, but in your

352
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:30,416
spirit begins to ask how am I going to do it?

353
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,083
When are they going to build a bridge

354
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:38,208
First start analyzing from the spirit,

355
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,291
not first speaking,

356
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,375
but it represents I'm going to do it like this,

357
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,791
You just know how the rest are going to do it

358
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:54,166
He doesn't know, you already manage to perfect

359
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,375
that spiritual construction,

360
00:18:56,375 --> 00:19:00,250
So that's where you say I know how I'm going to do it.

361
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,458
and it turns out perfect.

362
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,791
Then you have

363
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:07,833
origin, that is why it is said that everything was created on the moon,

364
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:11,333
everything is built on the moon.

365
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:15,500
In Spanish it would be first in spirit

366
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,791
so that things turn out well,

367
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,500
build it first very well from luna

368
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,833
and if they don't build it very well from the moon

369
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:28,958
all things fail, problems.

370
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,875
and likewise, because these beings

371
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:34,125
They materialized

372
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,541
and at dawn

373
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,416
it already materializes

374
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,000
and arises

375
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,833
first beings that are already

376
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:50,125
xxxx but now humans

377
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,208
of being gods

378
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,916
to order again

379
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:59,208
in the material,

380
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,208
organize the forest

381
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:05,000
like the father of the forest xxxx,

382
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,125
build

383
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,625
What is the care of the forest like?

384
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:08,916
That's why

385
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,250
when we talk about care

386
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,250
of the forest we base ourselves on that principle,

387
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:19,666
because in that code it explains everything

388
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,125
and so

389
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,666
the first men lived,

390
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:28,750
I say beings that lived, they were the children of the mother

391
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:33,708
and they built mountains xxxx.

392
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:34,541
and

393
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:39,833
by completing the mission now for us

394
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:43,250
humans, no longer gods, but

395
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:48,083
For us, they already left for xxxx.

396
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:48,625
Is for this that I know

397
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:53,416
He says that in xxxx they are present

398
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,791
and they demonstrate before the mamos

399
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,750
for the little brother,

400
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,458
for the xxxx, for the xxxx for the xxxx for

401
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,125
the xxxx, for any race

402
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:14,208
This is the placenta of humanity in xxxx.

403
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,583
So

404
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,083
That's what creation is.

405
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:21,333
Therefore since the creation

406
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,833
parents taught us

407
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,916
How to manage your own calendar

408
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:31,583
how forest management is taught,

409
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:35,000
how the management of sacred sites is taught,

410
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:39,791
It was they who organized that wisdom.

411
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:40,708
Every thing

412
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:44,625
who will receive poporo them

413
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,708
They organized it and we applied it.

414
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:51,708
when it burns

415
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,250
they taught us

416
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,250
and therefore based on that

417
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,041
healing is done

418
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:04,833
so that it does not affect life, so that Mma does not charge us.

419
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,208
Support.

420
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,083
And likewise

421
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:14,375
the wisdom of the sea, xxxx.

422
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,458
So

423
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,500
that's why every thing

424
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,083
and let's say mamos, every little thing

425
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:25,875
that you ask them, they know,

426
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,333
there is nothing mom or say

427
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:31,833
I don't know what that's like, nothing,

428
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:35,875
It's like our Google,

429
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:39,166
Spiritual Google.

430
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,458
Mm

431
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:45,166
Mamo is like me

432
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,291
spiritual

433
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,791
and

434
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:51,333
who was born of such a father

435
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,000
and what is the place like?

436
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,041
It's called that, place of

437
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,916
ways of speaking,

438
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,541
which is located as

439
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:06,083
at the other side of

440
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:10,625
the saw.

441
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:14,916
Mamo, because he fucks and dresses in white

442
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:15,583
has his

443
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:19,500
explanation, because he poporo, has his explanation,

444
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:21,833
there is nothing that says

445
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:25,000
Oh, I don't know what that will be like.

446
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:28,625
What is a butterfly? Ay! I do not know

447
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:31,875
It's no longer mamo,

448
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,750
but

449
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,791
you know the explanation,

450
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,375
the explanation

451
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,000
from this.

452
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And that's why we,

453
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,166
I have seen brothers who

454
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:45,791
when

455
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,000
the science that even if everything proves

456
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,500
It doesn't surpass that mamo explanation,

457
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,500
because it always points to the same thing

458
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,291
and the mom already knew it.

459
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,125
Are they also scientists?

460
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:04,291
They are scientists beyond teaching, that is why once

461
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:07,750
here in the mountains there is a mamo called xxxx,

462
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:13,041
they took him to

463
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,375
Europe.

464
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:18,375
There was a scientist, an astronomer, rather

465
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,041
he was a tenacious man

466
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:25,416
to, as they say, compete with mamo,

467
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,291
of stars,

468
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:30,083
and it turns out that there is one very star,

469
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:34,875
the smallest, but the most like in science

470
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:37,375
important.

471
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,000
So he

472
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,166
astronomer wanted to know if the mamo is so wise,

473
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,375
without making mistakes,

474
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:46,666
this is what i was looking for.

475
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,291
And it turns out that

476
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:51,375
xxxx

477
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:54,833
He arrived and began to speak the name of each star

478
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:55,416
and tells

479
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:59,083
This is the one you are testing me and this is what it is called,

480
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:04,166
Its function is like this.

481
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,708
can you talk about the importance of fire?

482
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:38,541
Everything was people.

483
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:43,000
In the beginning the fire was human

484
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,541
and continues to be so spiritually.

485
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:49,250
She is a person, she is a mother

486
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:52,291
or a father.

487
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,416
In the beginning,

488
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:58,500
in the very beginning

489
00:25:58,583 --> 00:25:59,875
It was not fire, just like this,

490
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:05,666
It was a spirit, but no one needed fire

491
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:10,333
and they always rejected.

492
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:13,416
The first parents rejected fire

493
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:16,291
because he was a child,

494
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:19,291
like a reddish child

495
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:21,000
that

496
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,791
when his mother told him

497
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:27,375
that they had to take care of that child because he was going to become

498
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:30,250
in the greatest

499
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,208
of all of you,

500
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:36,125
then the beings said like this

501
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:40,333
that a child that I saw born is going to be wiser

502
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:44,375
that I.

503
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:48,333
Selfishness comes from there,

504
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:51,333
They said I am superior to him

505
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,166
and his mother told him to take care of him

506
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:57,541
because he will be your boss or he will be your mom,

507
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:02,375
and they said no, he was a child that they didn't want.

508
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,250
What does that mean?

509
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:07,375
That the mother knew that in our life

510
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:10,541
We were going to use fire all the time,

511
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:13,791
like ours, our mom.

512
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:19,125
Then the indigenous the xxxx, well

513
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:23,083
fire is so important that from the moment it is born,

514
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:23,833
born next

515
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:26,833
of the fire that gives him warmth,

516
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:31,916
the food, it doesn't matter if you burn yourself,

517
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,875
better said, he can't do anything, because

518
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:37,583
If you say I will never use fire again

519
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:42,000
because a son burned me or burned me, well after a while

520
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,125
They are already needing it.

521
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,666
The same with water.

522
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,958
And let's say you're crossing with your dad

523
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:54,958
and the water carried them away.

524
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,500
You can't fight with water

525
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,125
because no matter how much I fight,

526
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:03,958
You will always need water.

527
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,250
Then the fire too

528
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:10,083
It was the same from the beginning.

529
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:13,125
and

530
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,666
How did they see that it was going to be necessary?

531
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,500
then they organized the father xxxx,

532
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:24,708
parents organized

533
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,041
that

534
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:27,458
since that beginning

535
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:31,666
They saw that in the future it was going to be necessary.

536
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,625
Then they created wisdom for him

537
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:41,375
for management, how to care,

538
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:44,791
proper care,

539
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:48,375
but if it is poorly cared for it is dangerous.

540
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:52,833
The fire is obedient, no more

541
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:57,250
if you give order

542
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,833
does what you order.

543
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:01,625
It catches on there in the forest,

544
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:02,458
turn on and

545
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:03,583
ends everything,

546
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:07,833
but if you don't give it that order, it just stays there

547
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:13,041
Quiet here, it stays there, if you need it to make food, nothing else is done,

548
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:17,208
but if you throw yourself there you will burn too.

549
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:18,916
That's why

550
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:22,625
the first beings, the mother ordered him,

551
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:28,791
They created spiritual management,

552
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:30,000
so this

553
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,833
the father of fire

554
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:39,458
xxxx, a male being and xxxx,

555
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:44,458
xxxx

556
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:47,875
a stone that is reddish,

557
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:52,291
which is fire, with that it goes out

558
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,625
In nature,

559
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,583
because everything has fire,

560
00:29:56,791 --> 00:29:59,041
then it is regulated

561
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:01,833
through those stones

562
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,833
so that they do not harm nature.

563
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:09,875
But the same power of the sun

564
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:12,916
can…

565
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:15,500
can sparkle

566
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,291
any rock has fire

567
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:22,291
and the forest can catch fire.

568
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:25,083
That's why we love them

569
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:28,416
through that stone, xxxx,

570
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,000
they do the work to refine.

571
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,750
When the job is not done well,

572
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:39,625
There is a lot of fire in the territory

573
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:42,416
and xxxx, whoever it is starts to burn, burn

574
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:45,041
the disaster begins,

575
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:47,916
Well, that's why you have to take care

576
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:52,583
through the stone in the place where the father is xxxx

577
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:55,666
and mother xxxx.

578
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,666
Yesterday we saw

579
00:30:57,666 --> 00:31:00,666
in the sector we were in

580
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:04,208
the father of fire and told us

581
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:06,041
the mamo xxxx

582
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:06,875
AND

583
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:10,541
later xxxx or father of fire ,

584
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:13,375
through cane fields,

585
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:19,166
by xxxx is the mother,

586
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:19,583
Is called

587
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:21,625
mother

588
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:24,458
of fire.

589
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:26,666
That's also where it came

590
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:31,125
the first fire,

591
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:34,541
that's why there are reddish stones

592
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:36,625
that

593
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:39,625
They call her mom.

594
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:40,791
You have to go to

595
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:45,208
place, down,

596
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,166
to have positive fire.

597
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:49,666
So.

598
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:53,583
As we live in a hut in the middle of the fire,

599
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:59,000
then it is cared for and regulated that way and does not cause harm.

600
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:03,250
It is very easy for a hut to catch fire.

601
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,041
That is the importance of fire.

602
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:10,083
Fire is a central, essential element

603
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:14,708
of the indigenous people.

604
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:16,916
When we go to work in the field,

605
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:20,375
We carry fires to scare away animals,

606
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:23,916
snakes,

607
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,250
mosquitoes

608
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,750
We carry fire everywhere,

609
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:34,375
It is part of our life, our culture.

610
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:37,125
When we go to pop

611
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:43,583
we are around the fire

612
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:46,666
and that is why it is said that the xxxx without fire

613
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:49,916
it wouldn't be xxxx,

614
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:52,291
I wouldn't have life

615
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:55,333
and that is why it is like its sacred object

616
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:59,291
that keeps all the time.

617
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:03,666
Is there a fire there in the hut?

618
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:07,000
It's always on.

619
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:10,666
And how is it going?

620
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,583
They

621
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:15,541
they use let's say like a rag

622
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:18,541
old clothes that are a fabric like this,

623
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:22,333
they get old and

624
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:26,291
They twist it and form it like a ball

625
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:28,791
so they don't burn quickly.

626
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:32,750
Then they turn it on and

627
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:34,708
they take it

628
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:39,000
in the hand or put it in

629
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,041
a small clay pot .

630
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:45,250
He takes it.

631
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,916
If you didn't use the lighter before

632
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:52,416
which today is used of the younger brother

633
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,458
because it's already a firework,

634
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:58,083
a firework

635
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:02,958
that the territory does not, does not accept it.

636
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:07,333
We handle natural fire,

637
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:10,666
skins, a type of skin called xxxx

638
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,375
that are like, like

639
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:17,458
not as crystal, like salt, but solid,

640
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:22,333
which are stones that pick up and between stones

641
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:25,416
They make friction and sparks vote

642
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:28,375
There is a tree that we use as a lighter or candle

643
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:31,166
so instant,

644
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:33,625
a tree called

645
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,625
Xxxx,

646
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:37,208
is to take a stick

647
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:41,083
and another stick and start…

648
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:43,583
oh and put some cotton there

649
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:47,833
and when you do it like that for a while it sparks.

650
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:49,958
Those are fires

651
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:53,833
pure, fires that do no harm,

652
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:56,833
but they are strong games,

653
00:34:56,833 --> 00:35:00,291
that you put whatever it is,

654
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:04,208
the hardest firewood and pulverizes it

655
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:06,750
fast and gives more heat.

656
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:11,458
and only those fires are the ones that must be put in the temple,

657
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:16,500
not with younger brother's fires, fuse.

658
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:19,375
That fire no longer has life

659
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:23,708
and that's why the color of the fire is like semi-yellowish

660
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:27,041
or white, because pure fires are

661
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,250
reds.

662
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,750
And where it's cold you catch yourself with that stick

663
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:36,250
and he lights the stick

664
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,500
and the heat remains,

665
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,750
spreads heat throughout the house area.

666
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:44,750
like the elders

667
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,500
They usually don't use blankets, just clothes

668
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,916
Even if it is in the wasteland, your only shelter

669
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,791
what gives him heat is

670
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:57,625
the fire.

671
00:35:57,625 --> 00:36:00,625
Fire is everything, fire

672
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:04,583
avoid danger, illness,

673
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:07,250
danger of nature.

674
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,375
That's why the first thing you do

675
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,250
when he arrives at a hut, like this

676
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,333
that normal, any animal can easily enter,

677
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:15,083
snakes

678
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:19,000
The first thing one does is sweep and place fire,

679
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:24,416
and if there are snakes up there, the smoke scares them away.

680
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,375
Spiders.

681
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:28,958
Everything is scared.

682
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:32,791
When they go to cultivate in the mountains they always carry a brand,

683
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:35,750
It is placed and

684
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:40,250
The smoke scares away everything and thus fewer flies bite you.

685
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:40,458
Is,

686
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:47,708
It's like the xxxx repellent.

687
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:52,083
And also because the younger brother today's health

688
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:55,166
He says it's bad for your health.

689
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,666
but a part does,

690
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:01,583
but as everything is protected from the levels

691
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:04,833
spiritual so that it is not a disease.

692
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:08,916
That's why

693
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:12,416
they have lived with smoke all their lives

694
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,750
and for us it is not a disease.

695
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:22,166
It's like the body adapts to that and

696
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,708
does not contaminate us because we

697
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:27,708
We don't inhale it all the time,

698
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:31,583
or else we would have charred lungs

699
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:36,416
like cigarette smokers.

700
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,625
That is why spiritual work is done

701
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:41,583
so that it is not harmful.

702
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:43,375
AND

703
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:46,833
that is the importance of fire.

704
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:50,125
It is dangerous,

705
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:55,708
The way they handle it.

706
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:57,166
We have all our lives,

707
00:37:57,166 --> 00:38:01,750
We have learned to handle fire.

708
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:03,083
that suddenly

709
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:06,791
in the middle of the hut in the center the fire, the children

710
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:10,541
when they fall asleep they can roll around, fall,

711
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:13,083
but we have already learned

712
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:18,458
How to prevent it from happening.

713
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:19,416
There are times that

714
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:23,708
yes there are accidents like that,

715
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:26,791
They have been burned, an aunt

716
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:31,125
or a small child falling to the ground, it has happened.

717
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,750
Yeah,

718
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,750
but sometimes.

719
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,750
We every month, every week,

720
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:44,666
from time to time that happens and when for us

721
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:45,958
fire does that

722
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:50,083
It is because there is spiritual debt that the fire is collecting

723
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:54,000
and if you don't organize that

724
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:56,083
the fire after

725
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,083
burn everything, your house, everything.

726
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:03,041
When it is done that no longer happens.

727
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:03,625
Well,

728
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:04,833
I want to ask you

729
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:08,083
like some quick things that we haven't talked about,

730
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:12,958
What is the meaning of the two peaks on the huts

731
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:17,541
or the shape of the house?

732
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:20,083
The earth

733
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:24,125
It's a round circle

734
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:26,708
but

735
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:29,708
It resembles a temple

736
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:32,416
and so

737
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:35,541
the explanation, wisdom says

738
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:37,166
I mean,

739
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:41,625
there are first mountains that the mother organized

740
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:44,708
and those first ones are called xxxx

741
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:46,916
and there are two peaks

742
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:50,083
that are seen there in the background, by that edge

743
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:53,375
In the morning you see each other, they are xxxx,

744
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:56,208
are two.

745
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:57,125
Similarity to that

746
00:39:57,125 --> 00:40:01,083
is what is built,

747
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:04,708
a house is built with those two,

748
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,416
two

749
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:09,166
sticks, two pieces

750
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:12,166
or two antennas.

751
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:14,458
Because those mountains,

752
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:19,416
according to traditional science, ancestral science,

753
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,416
the mountain is not formed

754
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:24,916
from the mountain surface, but

755
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,208
from the heart of the earth.

756
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:29,750
Your foundation

757
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:34,041
It comes from the heart of the earth and it goes out and it rises

758
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:39,291
because most of the mountain is above ground.

759
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:42,833
They were formed on the earth.

760
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:43,416
Because?

761
00:40:43,416 --> 00:40:47,083
Because these two mountains are the sanctuaries,

762
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:52,458
They are first, the first mountains that the Mother organized.

763
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:56,083
That's why when we go to build

764
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:56,666
and so

765
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:58,916
the mother did the same when

766
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:02,833
He began to organize the land to live on,

767
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:08,125
always when a circular house is going to be built

768
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:10,041
with a pita

769
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:12,750
to make the perfect circle,

770
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:16,083
always place in the center

771
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:18,291
a stick,

772
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:19,916
a stick

773
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:23,416
and then they hit the stick

774
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,000
a lasso, a rope with another stick

775
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:31,250
and extend like a compass to

776
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:33,291
make the circle

777
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:36,875
exactly where the posts will go.

778
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:38,375
Then the mother

779
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:43,041
When he was going to organize the land he did the same and located this

780
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,500
first, mountains,

781
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,250
that materialized in the mountains and that is why they are

782
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:52,083
there

783
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:53,208
those two.

784
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:58,375
So when the house of two is built,

785
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:01,041
that similarity is

786
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:05,041
that connects with space and connects

787
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:11,416
with the interior, with the mother,

788
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,291
It also means other things.

789
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:18,583
We have two eyes, two beings,

790
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:22,291
It means that too

791
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:25,375
and when they are made of two chunks

792
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:29,625
only in the town, in community they make two

793
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:33,375
and on farms you cannot build two,

794
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:36,083
but of one.

795
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:40,416
When we found a two-family farm there

796
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,791
It is because one is an important man,

797
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:46,750
for example, a xxxx

798
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,541
or a rich

799
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:54,750
who have a lot of wealth and are the ones who…

800
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:58,208
but in the mountains over there we find

801
00:42:58,291 --> 00:43:02,916
normal people, a lot of people.

802
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,125
We do not say poor, no, because that does not exist

803
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:10,041
in our culture, that is,

804
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:12,958
only as people

805
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:17,083
who has a normal life.

806
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:19,500
There are few things,

807
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,500
but enough to live on.

808
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:25,500
Here wealth is not measured

809
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,083
for material things, but for spiritual wealth.

810
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:30,541
We have a wise man

811
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:33,583
who is an authority that has a lot of wisdom, but

812
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:37,250
Well, he doesn't have cattle or anything, but he is wise,

813
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:41,250
has the right to the house with

814
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:42,541
the chubs.

815
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:44,666
So, how

816
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:48,041
can you comment that the big house is the same house

817
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:53,416
So, the hut house is the same as the mountain?

818
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,208
The temple is what is most explained.

819
00:43:57,291 --> 00:43:59,791
You enter xxxx

820
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:03,750
and look inside.

821
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:05,750
The structure,

822
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:09,291
It has a structure, I don't know if you have seen some sticks,

823
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:13,541
better said, intertwined and the mamos

824
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:18,291
He says that the inside of xxxx is like this

825
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:22,208
and it has nine circles above

826
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:25,583
representing nine planets

827
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:26,458
upwards

828
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:29,958
and spiritual, one

829
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:34,916
In the center of the temple there are two posts that support

830
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,708
that's what it represents

831
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:42,041
the two mountains that come from the heart of the earth,

832
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:46,291
holding this planet.

833
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:47,875
and

834
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:51,791
That's how they build the temple,

835
00:44:51,833 --> 00:44:55,333
because it was

836
00:44:55,416 --> 00:44:57,541
a spiritual decision.

837
00:44:57,541 --> 00:45:00,291
Being a mother's son

838
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:01,666
saw how

839
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:05,375
It was the internal structure of Mother Earth

840
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,125
and from there he brought the teaching

841
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:13,041
and he didn't give it to us.

842
00:45:13,125 --> 00:45:14,083
Lastly,

843
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,416
well we are talking about the mountains that

844
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:22,916
comes from the heart of the world, so I have heard

845
00:45:22,916 --> 00:45:25,916
Well, all the peaks

846
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:28,375
seniors are connected all over the world,

847
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:30,500
can you explain that to me.

848
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:35,458
When he made the first mountain, the center

849
00:45:35,541 --> 00:45:39,458
where he put the circle, where he put the mother

850
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:42,708
as the first mountain that connects with the center

851
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:47,208
and that is why in the temple it is explained that

852
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,583
things are placed, each thing

853
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:54,083
around the center, of the stick,

854
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:57,583
that represent position of each mountain

855
00:45:57,666 --> 00:46:01,958
and everything is connected,

856
00:46:02,041 --> 00:46:05,833
They are all tied together, they are all interconnected

857
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:10,083
and that is what gives the perfection of the temple.

858
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:11,750
So

859
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:16,333
mountains connect to each other

860
00:46:16,416 --> 00:46:20,125
and if one looks at a planetary level,

861
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:24,708
mountains exist as the highest in the world

862
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:28,125
that connect.

863
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:30,500
and then the lower mountains.

864
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,458
So we start from the top with xxxx

865
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:35,291
the highest mountain

866
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:38,291
and then it starts to go lower, lower

867
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:41,750
and here ends this one called xxxx

868
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:44,041
bigger and finishes sooner,

869
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:47,541
when xxxx and xxxx had not been destroyed

870
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:53,416
that ends as a low mountain,

871
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,166
That's what connection is.

872
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:57,208
Is that connection

873
00:46:57,208 --> 00:47:01,500
spiritual?
It's spiritual, it's spiritual

874
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,500
because the mother's design is perfect

875
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:09,708
and on the spiritual plane it is aligned,

876
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:13,708
They are already aligned,

877
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:18,208
I don't know if you've seen the spider web, imagine the spider web.

878
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:21,166
That is the fabric of the earth.

879
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:26,291
They are all connected woven very tightly, in a spiral shape.

880
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:29,666
And what happened in one place is accurate in the other place as well?

881
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:31,416
That's why

882
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:35,541
if we damage that mountain it affects it

883
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:40,500
Because they are connected below.

884
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:41,958
And explain why,

885
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:46,291
If it damages an organ, it affects the rest of the system,

886
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:50,583
the one that makes the body function.

887
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:54,666
Can you explain how very quickly

888
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:57,541
what's happening with Puerto Brisa and what is it?

889
00:47:59,791 --> 00:48:02,083
When the creation was established

890
00:48:02,083 --> 00:48:06,583
as from the ancestral territory,

891
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:09,333
mother design

892
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:12,666
for the four communities

893
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,708
and of all the things that are in nature

894
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:18,625
in a single space,

895
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:20,958
so everyone can do work

896
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:22,958
of everything on earth

897
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:25,125
or in the ancestral territory.

898
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:29,000
That's why there was a gap before.

899
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:31,500
immense,

900
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,666
a lagoon in the center

901
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:38,875
and it had rings of every species of plant.

902
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,958
We had a kind of palm,

903
00:48:42,166 --> 00:48:46,125
that surrounded the lagoon and on the second level

904
00:48:46,208 --> 00:48:49,083
a species of other vegetation and

905
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:51,833
so nine rings

906
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:54,291
I had that region,

907
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:59,000
and then birds, animals...

908
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:01,375
everything was concentrated there

909
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:04,625
And what does it mean?

910
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:08,875
Because there the mother integrated everything

911
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:11,583
and forces the four brothers to

912
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:16,500
perform work there collectively

913
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:20,000
so that the integrity is not lost,

914
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:23,833
It has to be united.

915
00:49:23,916 --> 00:49:27,083
So what happened, since it was a source

916
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:30,791
principal of spiritual life,

917
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:34,083
when all this went bad

918
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:36,666
altered

919
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:42,000
the rest of the fabric from sacred sites

920
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:45,833
and species began to appear that the mother

921
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:49,583
left beyond the ancestral territory,

922
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:52,833
a bird, some black birds,

923
00:49:52,916 --> 00:49:57,125
They began to enter the territory and eat others.

924
00:49:57,125 --> 00:50:00,166
birds, to dig their nests,

925
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:04,583
a total disaster, illness,

926
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:05,791
new diseases

927
00:50:05,791 --> 00:50:10,208
to the territory. It started to dry, when it happened

928
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:12,458
all the avocado dried ,

929
00:50:12,458 --> 00:50:14,041
plague fell on him,

930
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:17,041
Well, it also has another explanation for the fumigation.

931
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:20,125
And well, the fumigation is great.

932
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:21,791
But

933
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:24,541
his spiritual destruction was there

934
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:28,458
and many species were disappearing.

935
00:50:28,541 --> 00:50:31,375
The water began to go down,

936
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:35,000
the water level low.

937
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:38,583
That is, who made what and what is Puerto Brisa?

938
00:50:38,666 --> 00:50:39,333
Well,

939
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:42,500
Puerto Brisa is a foreign company

940
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:48,041
Brazilian company that was located there as a strategic point

941
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:53,875
to transport coal from Cerrejón in La Guajira,

942
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:58,333
why the Port of Santa Marta is a bit long.

943
00:50:58,333 --> 00:50:59,791
So

944
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:02,583
that's the closest point

945
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:04,833
to transport in trucks there

946
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:08,875
and transport to other countries.

947
00:51:08,958 --> 00:51:11,125
So, for that reason,

948
00:51:11,125 --> 00:51:15,000
because there were no other places on the beach like

949
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:16,000
with that

950
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,333
training to be a port,

951
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:20,916
then they burst,

952
00:51:20,916 --> 00:51:25,250
Before it was a mountain, a single mountain that was formed there

953
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:29,791
and what they did was split that mountain in half

954
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:33,291
and damaged these lagoons

955
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:36,375
and they lasted months

956
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:38,791
throwing everything away

957
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:40,958
and

958
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:43,958
There it smelled like metal.

959
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,083
Everything, everything and it's over.

960
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:49,416
The four towns

961
00:51:49,416 --> 00:51:53,125
They fought, but

962
00:51:53,208 --> 00:51:57,125
nothing happened.
