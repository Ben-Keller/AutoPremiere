1
00:00:05,583 --> 00:00:06,958
So, first of all.

2
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:09,958
What are they doing here?

3
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,583
Hey

4
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:14,416
Well, good night.

5
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:18,458
In the name of the xxxx

6
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:22,958
Here we meet every

7
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:26,041
every 20 or 15 days and

8
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,791
So we enter here,

9
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,250
Only women.

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,333
Only women

11
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,625
to talk,

12
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,041
for

13
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,958
weave,

14
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,583
to guide us.

15
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:45,958
Well,

16
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,583
talk to each other.

17
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:51,291
So everything,

18
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,791
every 20 or 15 days we meet.

19
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:57,791
And the time we last here,

20
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,916
Well, we lasted five days.

21
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:02,875
All night until midnight.

22
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:06,083
Concentrating.

23
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:06,708
Yeah,

24
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:09,875
because this is ours

25
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,291
job.

26
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:15,500
Because when Mother Earth was created,

27
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:18,833
Hey,

28
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:23,000
called Mother xxxx.

29
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,583
So when mother earth was created we

30
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,000
entrusted

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,583
to take care of mother earth.

32
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:35,958
And one of those things is that

33
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:41,166
Let's concentrate on knitting.

34
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,666
That's why when we pack the backpacks,

35
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,000
backpacks are made

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,333
of everything we think,

37
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:52,333
the backpack is woven.

38
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:56,625
Here when we are knitting we have to be thinking,

39
00:01:56,708 --> 00:02:00,708
In other words, have positive thinking.

40
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,000
So that the backpack,

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,708
because we make the backpacks for our husbands,

42
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:10,041
for our parents.

43
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,000
So that's why we have to do

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,583
the backpacks thinking

45
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:19,291
well, have a positive thought,

46
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,208
so that those backpacks

47
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:25,958
The person who is going to have it will do well.

48
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,291
The backpacks

49
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,583
you see that

50
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,666
starts in a circle and

51
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,208
circle, circle,

52
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,833
does not have…

53
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:42,875
If you keep weaving it, it has no end.

54
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,708
That is not a closed circle,

55
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,708
but a continuous circle.

56
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,791
So this is how mother earth was created,

57
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:53,666
then the backpack is made the same way.

58
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,958
Yes, that's why it's in circles.

59
00:02:57,041 --> 00:03:00,416
And here you see our

60
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,458
roof is made of circles

61
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,000
up and up

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,375
It ends in a point, but it ends in circles.

63
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,416
And the xxxx,

64
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,583
we are in circles

65
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,666
like mother earth.

66
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,041
Like the last time

67
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,583
I said that

68
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,666
We the women

69
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:25,125
We are like mother earth and mother earth the woman.

70
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,750
So,

71
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,125
That's why we're in circles.

72
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,916
Everything is a circle.

73
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:38,333
Yes and the backpacks,

74
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,041
This is the,

75
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,916
bone, there are three kinds of materials

76
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:47,666
to make backpacks, in fique or cotton,

77
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,333
bone two.

78
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,250
And the other is handmade thread ,

79
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,125
but not that one, that's what we sometimes do,

80
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,250
but the natural

81
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,833
It is fique and cotton,

82
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,750
That's our material

83
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,083
that we grow it here and here

84
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:06,083
we protect it ourselves.

85
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,791
Because now all of us xxxx are knitting,

86
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:15,666
one is just starting, others are

87
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,125
weaving, others are already finishing it.

88
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:18,625
For example,

89
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:22,375
There is one of the backpacks, you see it a little thick,

90
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,375
this is for work,

91
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,750
It is not for use, as I tell you,

92
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,666
for office use, but for field use,

93
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,708
to bring firewood, to bring shopping, to do...

94
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,375
not to

95
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:43,500
be burdened carrying bags with these backpacks.

96
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,875
So we do it

97
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:50,833
to use it for everything.

98
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:27,958
And those who are here are all of this?

99
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,000
community?

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,250
Yes, all the women of this community are here.

101
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,875
Each community has

102
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,875
her group of women,

103
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:44,458
Likewise, men have their own house

104
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,375
in xxxx

105
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:50,041
for them and this is the other one only for women.

106
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:53,125
What is your name?

107
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:57,291
The big house xxxx

108
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,916
xxxx .

109
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,916
And yes, that

110
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:07,208
circle, that is, does that also represent life a little?

111
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,333
Yeah,

112
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:13,875
Why we,

113
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:17,500
we have… yes, this

114
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
represents life, life

115
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,958
keep going, keep going, keep going

116
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:25,125
and after dying, well it also continues,

117
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:28,458
It has no end, we don't know where it ends.

118
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:33,708
So that's also why everything goes here in the backpack.

119
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,291
Yes.

120
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,291
many of the sacred sites here are called xxxx .

121
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,083
And that's also a word for women?

122
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,791
Can you talk a little more about that?

123
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,958
Are they similar or are they the same thing?

124
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:50,333
Sacred sites are called xxxx because that is what they are.

125
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,666
sacred, like us

126
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:52,666
women, we

127
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,166
women

128
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:56,250
We are very sacred, because all men and women too

129
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,166
They are sacred.

130
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:01,416
But it's more about women and those places

131
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:05,416
They represent, those sites are women too

132
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,291
They were women and

133
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:10,958
So that's why they call it xxxx .

134
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:11,958
xxxx what does it mean?

135
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,500
Mother,

136
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,500
mother, mom

137
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,958
So why do we

138
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:24,041
all women give life.

139
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,875
Yeah,

140
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,041
that's why it is.

141
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,083
Just like the places.

142
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:40,583
The places.

143
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,375
And something else

144
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:45,125
What do you want to share about this?

145
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,958
well, from the woman, from this place,

146
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:52,166
what is happening here now?

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,041
In the big house, no

148
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:59,958
well here all the time,

149
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:00,875
all…

150
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:06,208
Every time we meet we talk about different topics and

151
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,458
So today was, today was the night to do

152
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:14,041
the backpack for men, for those

153
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:18,666
at work. Another night another kind of backpack.

154
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,500
Yeah

155
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,166
and we put the backpacks

156
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:25,291
colors too, the colors of us naturals

157
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,250
It's black, red and... not red,

158
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,750
the orange, the black orange and the yellow.

159
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:33,416
What does it mean?

160
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,625
Yellow means joy.

161
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,125
The black,

162
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,166
black represents that when

163
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,166
before the world was created,

164
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,708
the world was dark.

165
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,708
There was no life in material ,

166
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,500
there were only spirits,

167
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,291
so that's why it represents black

168
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,750
And it also represents that sometimes we are positive

169
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,375
and negative. I mean, we think bad and we think good.

170
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,041
So that's why

171
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,541
The black and white.

172
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,458
But there is more white in the backpack

173
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:12,333
because we have to be more

174
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,916
good.

175
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:18,416
Good mind, positive mind and little black

176
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,083
because

177
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:24,416
Nor can it be everything, everything black and everything white.

178
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,500
And red represents life,

179
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:32,291
which is like blood, because if we don't have blood

180
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,000
there is no life.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,916
Because when we,

182
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:39,375
when, when the mother created us

183
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:45,333
He created us through the earth,

184
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,000
then the blood, the red

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,291
represents the earth that is life.

186
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:55,125
And does that also have to do with the necklaces?

187
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:59,250
The necklaces that we carry around our necks,

188
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,666
that makes us see

189
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,625
different with men,

190
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,916
because they also have long hair,

191
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,208
then they carry a backpack

192
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:13,250
and we women necklaces.

193
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,000
and the white

194
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
represents the snowy, that the snowy is white

195
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,541
and thought

196
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:25,208
nice, positive thinking

197
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,791
and peace is white.

198
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:28,416
Is that too?

199
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,458
the dress?
He

200
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,833
clothing that we all carry

201
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:35,833
and they all have whites

202
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,750
and

203
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,125
already.

204
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,125
And we all have red necklaces

205
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,833
that represent life.

206
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,083
Why the mother too?

207
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,166
The mother is earth.

208
00:10:54,541 --> 00:11:00,041
Can you tell us what your name is?

209
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,458
and where are we?

210
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:08,333
xxxx community

211
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:13,708
and well my name is Carmen

212
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:18,375
and my traditional name is xxxx .

213
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,000
So

214
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,208
here we are also talking about strengthening

215
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,125
our traditional names,

216
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,416
because many of us were changed

217
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:31,291
traditional names many years ago,

218
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,541
When the colonists came to civilization

219
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,000
they left us, they left us

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,791
banning traditional names.

221
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:41,750
So we were losing them, but now we are

222
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,083
again in recovery

223
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,541
of our traditions, traditional names.

224
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,375
Does your name have a meaning?

225
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:53,208
Every name has a meaning

226
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,250
and with the name given to the children

227
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,125
is he,

228
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,000
is he,

229
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,500
as I say,

230
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,958
with the name you already know

231
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,958
what he is going to be.

232
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:09,375
Yeah.

233
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,000
So how

234
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,083
They didn't know, they weren't prohibiting it, removing it, all that,

235
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:19,166
but we are already in recovery

236
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,833
our traditional names.

237
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:26,000
Likewise with the cotton fabric that was already

238
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,875
as

239
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,791
already finishing, that no one wanted to knit it.

240
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,625
No, it is already

241
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,916
forgetting to weave cotton,

242
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,458
but we are already

243
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:38,625
strengthening ourselves more in our traditional fabric,

244
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:43,333
which is with cotton.

245
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,583
Fique too, since it is a plant too?

246
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,583
If fique is a plant.

247
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:53,125
And lastly, I don't know if there is a message

248
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:58,250
What would you like to bring to the world of women?

249
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:03,541
Of course let's take care of nature.

250
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,708
that we take care

251
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,125
mother Earth,

252
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,791
because if we don't take care of mother earth,

253
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,416
because the mother,

254
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,583
We live on mother earth, if we don't take care of it,

255
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:17,583
Well, we are ending up in ourselves,

256
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,875
because mother earth,

257
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:24,041
there are the rivers, the plants,

258
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:29,958
the animals, the stones, the mountains.

259
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,916
Yes, because if we finish the mountains

260
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:36,666
The animals are running out, everything is over and so are we.

261
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,166
we're running out, so

262
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,625
that

263
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,750
let's take more care

264
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,125
the planet.

265
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,000
Last question

266
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,833
The thread, the xxxx I know has a great meaning

267
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,875
xxxx culture I don't know if

268
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,375
can talk about that a little bit.

269
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:05,166
I know that everything is connected in your tissues.

270
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,500
Yes, this is a xxxx ,

271
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:12,291
We tell him that, we tell him xxxx

272
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:12,791
xxxx .

273
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,791
And the cotton one

274
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,750
is

275
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,291
xxxx

276
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,083
everything is xxxx

277
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,875
then through xxxx

278
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:31,208
We are like mother earth.

279
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,083
It has xxxx too.

280
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,750
What are those xxxx ?

281
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,458
The rivers.

282
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,083
We women are also xxxx .

283
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,291
Yeah,

284
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,625
Because through one our body runs,

285
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,875
we have our veins

286
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,666
that's a xxxx too. So

287
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,583
we are connected

288
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,666
with, for example,

289
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:05,291
If we dry up a river or cover up a river, well, we are,

290
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:09,708
We are like blocking our veins, our arteries.

291
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,375
And then you don't have to cover a river,

292
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,416
because that is an xxxx , so that's how we are connected.

293
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,750
Those xxxx are imaginary, that suddenly one says

294
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,041
but where is the xxxx I don't see it.

295
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:24,458
But they are there, there are the rivers, the mountains,

296
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,958
the mountains you see like,

297
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,958
like it has a thread

298
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:33,958
well, that's a xxxx .

299
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:34,875
Very nice.

300
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,750
Nice, well, our roof, you see it

301
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,791
everything has is

302
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:44,208
tied by means of xxxx , by means of vines,

303
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,166
vines, everything is tied by means of vines,

304
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:50,458
those are xxxx .

305
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:55,083
So it's xxxx .

306
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,041
And everything is connected?

307
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:00,083
With xxxx

308
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,750
Armed with that.
Armed with the xxxx .

309
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,750
Well, thank you very much.
