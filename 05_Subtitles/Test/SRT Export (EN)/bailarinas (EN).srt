Good morning,

32
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:32,833
My name is Katiuska Yamileth Jiménez Fajardo.

33
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,041
I'm here,

34
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,583
I'm here with this

35
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,666
learning to dance

36
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:44,375
Yonna, listen to this

37
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:47,083
and know everything

38
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:50,083
is heard belonging to

39
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:54,583
what is called

40
00:01:54,666 --> 00:02:00,166
The Sauyeepia School

41
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,833
That.

42
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,166
Is.

43
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,875
Well , well. and for you

44
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:10,583
which? Well, what did we just see in the dance?

45
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,125
Can you explain to me ?

46
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,500
What what happened ? _

47
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,416
What were they doing in the dance, the steps

48
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,333
and the significance it has?

49
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:23,333
Well, our traditional dance,

50
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,541
Well, since long ago,

51
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:29,083
Since ancient times it has had some main variants.

52
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:32,166
which are called pachikuata and Pa'tawa , which

53
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,166
Well, it was what we danced at the beginning.

54
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,208
AHA

55
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,708
Our steps are closely related to nature,

56
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:46,666
in fact there we take like birds, for example, in

57
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,125
the one who is crouched

58
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:48,416
is called

59
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:52,291
Tortolita is one of the traditional birds typical of here

60
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,916
We also take into account traditional games.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,166
There is also, for example, the tro mpo , which is the one danced

62
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,125
going around and around , that one too. The one we dance

63
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:07,208
g represents the Samutkuaya (Zamuro)

64
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,750
in fact the one who is here,

65
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,083
the little black one, well that's the one we were imitating.

66
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,083
We imitate all the birds

67
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:18,458
in everything related to nature, the cloud, the wind.

68
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,583
That's more or less ours .

69
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:23,083
meanings .

70
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:32,083
Does anyone else want to talk ?

71
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:32,416
Well

72
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,416
And you, what is the connection you have when you are dancing?

73
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,916
Good with your spirituality

74
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,166
nature or with the boy too?

75
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,166
How do they feel ?

76
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,750
What is the experience like?

77
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,000
So

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,833
The most beautiful thing is that we enter a kind of

79
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,833
a harmonization.

80
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,625
Both in the Piyoi (dance space)

81
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:56,875
the ground, his elo, the circle and with the people around us.

82
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:01,000
But Yonna, more than anything, we do it for pleasure,

83
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,541
for pleasure, oneself,

84
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,416
because

85
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,000
As you can see, not all of us Wayuu do it .

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,916
I mean, lately we are losing it

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,375
thanks to the fact that they exist

88
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:17,875
centers

89
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:21,000
like the teacher's, like Saüyeepia , where , for.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,250
Where

91
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,000
They strengthen and we try to

92
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,291
to give it,

93
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:32,666
make known and that other young people

94
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,500
strengthen.

95
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,250
that part.

96
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,375
Or also like

97
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:37,916
helps us,

98
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,875
as well as to also highlight

99
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,000
those values that we have here,

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,291
that for example that of harmony

101
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,375
be at these events and start with a

102
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:52,375
Yonna is like starting to liven up the meeting.

103
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:52,666
I mean,

104
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,500
That must be

105
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,750
the main thing,

106
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,000
It should not be left last, it should not be left in the middle . C on

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,125
That is what it begins , at the touch of the Kasha (drum) .

108
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:05,041
It's like someone who says the notice says now, the event is going to start.

109
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,875
Come here, get together, cheer up.

110
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:07,958
That's like the sign.

111
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:08,666
So just one

112
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:09,958
listen to sound,

113
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,833
Now the women get ready and say “I want to dance . ”

114
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:13,083
I mean,

115
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,125
It's not like they force you

116
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,833
But women say I want to dance ,

117
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:21,875
that you feel it, exactly like something that moves you.

118
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:22,958
And that too.

119
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,708
What is the role of women?

120
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,416
I see that the woman is going

121
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,083
controlling, exactly if

122
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,291
because it is not a competition but as a whole.

123
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,750
The man and the woman, but the woman there

124
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,625
It is the fundamental basis, because

125
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,458
the two, the two people, both the man and the woman,

126
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,375
Well, they are like giving,

127
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,125
showing his skill, showing his strength.

128
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,708
The man dances backwards,

129
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,250
He doesn't look even though we are going straight , I mean.

130
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,666
there is no advantage.

131
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,666
Honestly, we're on the same level,

132
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,625
but the women there in that case are the ones that show the most

133
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,083
the force

134
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,791
because the faster it goes

135
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,375
has the possibility of knocking him down,

136
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,833
thus showing worth and strength.

137
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,083
Sometimes yes

138
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,541
came at the moment of knocking down a man at the dance,

139
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,083
He says no, that girl is strong,

140
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,958
that family must be well prepared,

141
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,625
If you should have that woman,

142
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,833
then they start looking too.

143
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,833
The man If they see that it lasts a lot, as in the case of

144
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,083
Conraditus

145
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,041
He danced with all of us, then he danced again.

146
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:27,791
Then he says no,

147
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:28,750
that boy

148
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,958
He is strong, he already knows , he already has experience, he dances, he likes it,

149
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:32,333
So

150
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,416
are those little things that really

151
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,333
It makes everything wonderful.

152
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,583
And that has a relationship too.

153
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,375
to the Wayuu culture , bone

154
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,958
the role of women is something similar

155
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,333
to dancing, it's like that too.

156
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,458
Women are very important in our culture.

157
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,458
As I said at the beginning,

158
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,375
we are all who are

159
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,750
here, we are women trainers,

160
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,125
although we are not mothers, although we are not grandmothers or anything,

161
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,958
but for the simple fact of being in a family

162
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,375
be in our territory,

163
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,166
We are transmitting our knowledge to girls,

164
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,208
children. In these moments here

165
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:10,333
Well, we now reveal something of what we know

166
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,458
and that makes us a woman

167
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,291
Trained ra.

168
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,833
all the knowledge that a woman has is very sacred

169
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,666
and they are

170
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,375
spiritually as connected with

171
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,750
with everything that surrounds us.

172
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,750
In fact, dance also has a

173
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,333
a spiritual connotation, because when dancing

174
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,000
barefoot because we relate to our Mother

175
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,125
Earth (mma) then that helps us

176
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:34,458
also

177
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:38,291
how to connect with the dreams that we are going to have that day

178
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,708
to harmonize our territory

179
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:48,791
so that we have good dreams, good omens, as they say

180
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:53,750
How did you feel at the dance ?

181
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,875
Jaashaja jumala

182
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,750
talk girls

183
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,083
Well,

184
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:03,166
dance for me has a meaning,

185
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:08,291
because when we dance

186
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,208
we feel like dancing with

187
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:14,208
freedom, with joy,

188
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:18,125
with love, so because it is our culture,

189
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,458
we feel that we are free to express ourselves

190
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:25,250
in that way, dancing with our partner.

191
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,208
That's what we have done, we women

192
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:32,791
wayuu, dance, because Yoona has a lot of meaning,

193
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:36,666
because it is very, very used in various events

194
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:41,541
on several occasions, such as the departure of a Majayut (young woman) ,

195
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:45,541
like a confinement

196
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,750
and many things.

197
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,291
That's why we have Yonna

198
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,833
present at any time,

199
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,333
because it is something that represents us

200
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,333
to us Wayuu women and it is the Yonna

201
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Yes, they also asked me that, when did he introduce himself to

202
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:05,625
the dance ? Here it is for this event, but traditionally when? .

203
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,875
By rituals , by rituals,

204
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,875
by dream, in hills

205
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,291
or the departure of a Majayut (newly young lady) .

206
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,666
And what is Majayut?

207
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,166
A, just, a just young lady

208
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,333
what, what was J imolü (girl)

209
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:25,541
When she develops, they lock her up and when she comes out

210
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:29,208
She is practically a young lady who is already forming

211
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:33,750
and then be a good person.

212
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,500
That is a ritual too , a ritual

213
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,500
what is done to the new ladies

214
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:42,250
and the Yonna is done

215
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,500
when it's going to come out, when it's going

216
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,916
make yourself known as a new woman,

217
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,916
because she is no longer a girl, she is going to be a woman, then

218
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:54,500
This ritual is performed and it is also accompanied by food,

219
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,875
drink, like a party, as they say,

220
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,750
but more than anything it is for that.

221
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,375
also been like a celebration

222
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,958
Yes, it's also like a celebration.

223
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,708
Yes, because when they dance they begin to say well,

224
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,166
look, a lady is going to come out, a woman and the men

225
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,250
they are always too

226
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,416
as if waiting to see who that new lady is

227
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,416
Who is that new lady?

228
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:24,791
And that ritual also works , it's good to dance the Yonna in the middle of that ritual

229
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,208
It's like driving away bad spirits,

230
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,375
As if to say we already danced, we already ate,

231
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,958
Those spirits are already happy

232
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:32,583
and they are full

233
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,083
They are going to leave this new lady alone

234
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,666
so that your process lives .

235
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,500
And they are made for that too.

236
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,125
If a dream does not ask you to do a dance at that time

237
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:46,416
such a lady must dance, put on this costume,

238
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,041
one does it to get away precisely

239
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,041
those bad spirits, diseases and so on.

240
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,166
And how long does this confinement last?

241
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,041
It's the lockdown

242
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:02,333
In itself , it lasts during the days of menstruation, but

243
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,958
After her menstruation she has to remain locked up

244
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,958
approximately a month and a half or two months.

245
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,958
It depends on the family,

246
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,708
It depends on your grandmother or the person or woman

247
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,041
who is accompanying her.

248
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,666
And where is the bull run ?

249
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,333
In a mud house

250
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,333
when the girl has her first menstruation

251
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:24,125
He tells his mother, months before they will have chosen

252
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,833
a woman who will be accompanying her ,

253
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,708
He will be instructing her, he will be guiding her,

254
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,916
saying and teaching the values, everything

255
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,291
related to knitting, for example.

256
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,833
Then she will be locked in a mud house

257
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,916
which is like that always.

258
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:42,458
It's always secluded, it's a new little house, in fact,

259
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:46,166
They prepare her, let's suppose, she is just a young lady,

260
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:46,875
not long ago

261
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,083
has already been developed

262
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,333
when she developed before she developed

263
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,333
Sorry, obviously between the family

264
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,333
We get together and say well, the girl is growing up,

265
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,000
Your new stage is already approaching,

266
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,041
So we have to prepare everything.

267
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:04,000
Then a new house is ordered to be built and it is bought

268
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,166
everything absolutely new because it is going to be a stage

269
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:12,041
And the old is given away

270
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,708
What if which one is it?

271
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:14,416
What are the

272
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:18,291
women's jobs or women's roles

273
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:22,666
on a day to day basis ? .

274
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,958
There are five fixed jobs as such, there is that of the Outsü

275
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:30,583
which is the, practically the pillar of the Wayuu territory

276
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,625
within our culture

277
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:35,208
is the

278
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:38,208
O ulaküt the visionary,

279
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,041
there is the woman E´inalü

280
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:45,666
What is she, the artisan ? there is the woman, the ceramist

281
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,125
and finally there is the woman

282
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:51,250
trainer that in this case well there are all of us included ,

283
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,625
Those are the five fundamental jobs

284
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:58,166
And within those five, the others are already released.

285
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,291
For example, dance comes from being a female trainer.

286
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,416
And they want to share something more

287
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,833
that I had not asked them.

288
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,791
I don't know what you want to ask

289
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,416
who want to know more.

290
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,500
From a woman's everyday day.

291
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,000
wayuu

292
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,333
What is an E´inalü woman like?

293
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,208
In that of an artisan , for example.

294
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:28,375
She can share with you because she is an artisan.

295
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,916
Well, like all roles

296
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,375
which like all roles, is also very important

297
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,375
harmonization at the moment

298
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,000
to knit because we knit

299
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,125
For pleasure, not all of us knit .

300
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:41,625
Suddenly,

301
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:46,125
At a time of confinement, they instill a lot of craftsmanship in us,

302
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,916
but it goes in one as a woman or as a lady.

303
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:54,833
well, I am a life-forming mother

304
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,291
and

305
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,541
I don't

306
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:01,791
pay attention to the fabric at the time of my development.

307
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:05,625
I liked it years later ,

308
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,541
already at 15 years old

309
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,583
I started knitting since

310
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,583
There I consider myself an artisan because I have been

311
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:14,916
1 0 years in this profession

312
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,708
when knitting,

313
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:20,041
let's say it the way it is explained

314
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:25,291
It's something nice because, because one enters into harmonization so much that if

315
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,916
we are going to give him a relationship,

316
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:34,375
We can give it like at the time of gestation of a baby because

317
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,625
just as the fetus grows inside our womb,

318
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,958
that is, it is the same, as it is done in the backpack

319
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,708
it is growing, little by little

320
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:46,750
They give him love and care

321
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,041
and we give

322
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,416
and we try to ensure that it does not have a deformity,

323
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,000
that I don't have,

324
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,291
that is, one wants it to be perfect ,

325
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:01,041
the same with the baby

326
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,041
and when it comes out it is

327
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,708
when comes

328
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,000
the feeling of

329
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,416
of gratitude, of satisfaction,

330
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,833
because already

331
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,750
It's something beautiful, something I can't explain

332
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,041
It is true and so are all

333
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:18,916
all roles

334
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:23,875
or all our roles are like that, everything has one , that is,

335
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:28,375
how you will feel very spiritual, something that, as they say, is very

336
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:32,166
Exactly, it's very difficult to explain

337
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,708
I mean one feels it.

338
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,416
And when you see, for example, an artisan,

339
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,000
Well, one already interprets everything

340
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,250
without needing her to explain to me

341
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,500
already knows that she is a mother

342
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,125
For this reason we do not explain with our mouths but with our hands.

343
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,583
And the designs, the dance.

344
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,333
Also the dance.

345
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,791
Just by starting to do

346
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:00,208
The different variants say “ah it's such a bird”

347
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,708
without needing to tell one

348
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,916
And that's what they have on their face

349
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,958
Can you explain to me what it is? why does he do it? that

350
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,458
What significance does it have ? What symbol ?

351
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,375
Well this is achepa (makeup) it is one of

352
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,875
Our traditional makeup

353
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,333
can be done in different ways

354
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,750
ways, it also has different uses

355
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,958
also depending on the occasion.

356
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:24,666
Right now,

357
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,333
how this is a meeting

358
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,750
and how we did the harmonization.

359
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,583
Well, we design.

360
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,208
This means the sun,

361
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:32,875
we draw the sun,

362
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,250
taking advantage of the fact that the sun is hot today,

363
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,500
So we capture all that, everything.

364
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,666
As I said, nature

365
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,000
It is in us, that is like our life too

366
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:42,750
I mean because

367
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,375
We left our Mother Earth, as we say,

368
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,250
so everything is connected with us.

369
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,791
So today we played the Sun

370
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,750
and it can, we can, even those who are in the kitchen.

371
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:59,291
I don't know if we can see it today, because we cover our entire face.

372
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,875
with another who is paip ai

373
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,291
or it can be with mmeera , which are mushrooms.

374
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:03,750
For example.

375
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,791
This is a plant, it is called Pa li'ila

376
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,958
One has to wait for it to fall, for it to set

377
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:13,416
Red, she has her bone preparation, everything is a process,

378
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,750
and the one we have is already prepared,

379
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,875
It is simply starting to add water in this case,

380
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,916
but usually traditionally

381
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,875
It is with white sheep's bo

382
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:26,791
is with sebo .

383
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:27,791
He knew too

384
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:31,666
It is another process in which they prepare the tallow, strain it

385
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,125
it is white, white,

386
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,583
whitey is not just any sheep,

387
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,208
It doesn't have to be a small sheep either.

388
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:37,833
Newly

389
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,083
then they start preparing it

390
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,625
and then one has it stored there

391
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,583
and when we are going to use it, we apply the tallow

392
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,625
and then we apply the p aipai

393
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,750
Yes, yes it is for

394
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,333
as a blocker, if we are going to look for firewood, if we are going to cook

395
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,791
so that our faces don't burn ,

396
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:56,000
so that it doesn't get stained . In this case, since it is a ritual,

397
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,083
as we are in harmonization and it is a meeting

398
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,208
We say mi'ira, then we have

399
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,916
the agility to capture what we want

400
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,708
like makeup for different occasions,

401
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:12,125
Not then, for an event, a soft makeup

402
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:15,500
that for a recording it is already something better ,

403
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,750
It's almost like that

404
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,083
And that spiral too

405
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,708
It also has a meaning , because the dance is spiral, Yes.

406
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:26,583
Everything in our culture, everything being, everything

407
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,833
It is based on the spiral,

408
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:32,333
because in our life after dying,

409
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,250
We are going to Jeepira as we say,

410
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,208
already have like another life in the afterlife.

411
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,666
So it's not like suddenly by scale, like suddenly

412
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,208
in that of Westerners,

413
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,750
which is by stairs , until it reaches the last

414
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,750
Ours is a spiral because we don't know where it ends,

415
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:52,583
because one travels the path of life in a spiral

416
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,333
and come back again for the same

417
00:18:56,416 --> 00:19:00,833
what is Jeepira

418
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,083
Can you explain me

419
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,041
What was the ritual he did?

420
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,791
with smoke and wood? and why did he do that?

421
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,250
AND

422
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,208
That is an incense, it is not witchcraft,

423
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:18,541
It is not witchcraft, it is our incense, as it is a harmonization

424
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:22,250
Well, we are pushing away the bad energies.

425
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,291
It's very good too

426
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,958
to ward off those diseases like the plague

427
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,250
In fact, I have it posted here too.

428
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,583
This is not wood, it is white bija,

429
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,250
It is a plant that

430
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,041
It is widely used for general ailments.

431
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,291
in fact during Covid

432
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,250
This is what helped us a lot,

433
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,416
a lot, as a territory

434
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,875
wayuu, was what we could say,

435
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,291
which saved the lives of many Wayuu .

436
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,333
So,

437
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,500
So what I did was

438
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,208
a kind of incense, because we make it akai'ja

439
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,750
to move away

440
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,458
those bad energies and make this meeting a good one

441
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:59,125
fruitful and for also, since later

442
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,041
do not come

443
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:03,500
pests, taking into account that nowadays we see them ,

444
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,708
Virus variants ,

445
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,250
what is affecting many Wayuu children

446
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,208
That's why it helps us a lot.

447
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,125
And to start the dance too.

448
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:16,083
Exactly, to also just start the dance.

449
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,416
That is why some elderly

450
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:29,166
breathe freely.

451
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,791
Well, well, the video too,

452
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,375
That's how it can be explained.

453
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,750
Well we've seen a lot of red

454
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,166
and it has a meaning also in the culture for you is

455
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,625
women, for the wayuu

456
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:43,291
yes of course,

457
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,208
the Red color

458
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,416
It is one of our most representative colors.

459
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,375
It means for us purity, love, peace.

460
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,791
But it also means blood

461
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,375
It also has, it has like

462
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,291
one meaning

463
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,500
positive, so to speak,

464
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,791
but at the same time something like negative because the blood for us

465
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,125
It is very valuable, it is sacred .

466
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,458
In fact, if we suppose at this moment

467
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:15,500
there is a conflict and a person is affected

468
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,416
and his blood is spilled, because everyone says no, now

469
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,291
That is a problem,

470
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:23,083
Then we have to solve it because blood was shed ,

471
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,250
so the blood here in that

472
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,000
meaning of

473
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,750
which is very sacred,

474
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,750
You don't play with it , even with the animal's blood.

475
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,250
if it is by ritual or if it is by dream.

476
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,166
There are times

477
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,666
in which it should be allowed to spill

478
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,666
and there are times or occasions in which it is consumed.

479
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,291
Does not consume it

480
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,666
Neither are men generally consumed either,

481
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,583
so

482
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,291
and like everything, also what we have

483
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:49,541
In our culture it is red , for example the achepa is red

484
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,125
it is already

485
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,416
one of our most representative birds , it is also red .

486
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:54,958
iisho

487
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,833
He is a cardinal, then

488
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,541
that is, basically red

489
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:02,916
It's like what we have the most there, that is, it's what we have the most

490
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:03,625
represents us

491
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:10,000
and it has that meaning related to everything. Also these blankets

492
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,958
It makes us feel like , if one wears red,

493
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:15,041
one feels at home, calm, it transmits to us

494
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,416
It is also or instead.

495
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:19,416
If one wears another color, for example yellow, I don't know,

496
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:22,458
one feels like one feels uncomfortable,

497
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,416
but red is what represents us the most.

498
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:28,416
It means a lot to us.

499
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:32,125
Add some of anything to it.

500
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:32,458
Come?

501
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:38,750
Do you want to say something else?

502
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,166
Yeah

503
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:44,875
Tell Kati how you felt in the Yonna , for example.

504
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:48,875
You who are new, how did you think of Yonna?

505
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:53,583
Or whatever you want to express

506
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,791
Well, she's my little sister.

507
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,125
If that's why I scold her a lot,

508
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:04,125
She 's my little sister, so she's new at school.

509
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,541
So she's learning and she's learning

510
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:06,750
Then I'll

511
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,583
I'm saying share with us how you've been feeling,

512
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,041
did you like it?

513
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:14,916
So

514
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,541
when one dances in the Yoona,

515
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:21,875
When I dance, I feel happy,

516
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:26,833
one, I feel this, I feel that

517
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:29,458
I feel happy

518
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:33,708
to do what I want.

519
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,916
I want to learn, this I want,

520
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:41,875
I want to be one, I want to be like this as my partner See u

521
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:47,375
I want to learn to knit, to dance

522
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:50,958
also, make hammocks,

523
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,833
make backpacks,

524
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,333
this one

525
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:59,333
is to be a seedbed

526
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,416
and

527
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,416
make wayunkeera

528
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:06,875
be way unkeera what we do with mud

529
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,791
and what else.

530
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,166
And that seedbed ?

531
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:12,916
What is it? seedbed are the school children, the

532
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:15,708
smaller. So

533
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:19,208
Seedbeds comes from the word seed sa uyee .

534
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,541
So that's why we say seedbed , so yes.

535
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:24,750
and like her, like that

536
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,750
As we have many children at school.

537
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:31,666
So with the children, no, we don't take them like that.

538
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,666
She is my little sister, I have been at school for many years

539
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,166
and I don't take it like that,

540
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:37,500
but it is something that must be awakened in her.

541
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,166
Tell me no, I want to go

542
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:43,666
, I want to learn what everything is

543
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:44,541
d the want.

544
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:46,291
If I am forced to take it

545
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:47,666
here he was with his face,

546
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:50,000
but no, she enjoys it and enjoys it.

547
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,375
So much so, it looks fun and feels very good.

548
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,791
It was the first one you did

549
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:59,875
and how well I am, how well.

550
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,833
Well and for each of you

551
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,791
If I could carry a message to the whole world.

552
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:11,708
What message would it be?

553
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:17,958
You start. Can you think for a moment

554
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:21,458
I hope we don't let our culture lose.

555
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:25,250
If it is something so beautiful and so ours.

556
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:27,958
and it would be nice

557
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:29,250
that we value it more

558
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,000
and let's strengthen it

559
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
because as I tell you this has not been lost,

560
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,250
It's just that we have to strengthen it

561
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:42,125
but that is in one

562
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,666
Well

563
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:46,583
as the companion said.

564
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:49,875
As we are experiencing what the Yonna is

565
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:53,666
which is making wayunkeera (clay doll) or doing many things

566
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:58,583
As you can do it too, you can practice.

567
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,875
Of course, it's not easy,

568
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:05,041
but if given time, they can learn to dance,

569
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:09,416
They can learn to be wayunkeera (clay doll)

570
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,708
to knit,

571
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:13,291
don't be ashamed of the culture

572
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:16,583
because it is beautiful.

573
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:17,541
Be wayuu

574
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:20,541
It is the most beautiful thing in this life

575
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:24,916
and learn many things from our ancestors that already

576
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,666
They are not here with us now, but there are

577
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:33,625
things that have left us

578
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:39,791
speaks

579
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:41,583
send a message to the children

580
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:47,708
I want to send the message to the boys and girls.

581
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,583
I want him not to be ashamed

582
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:54,875
of the Wayuu culture that

583
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,416
To learn

584
00:26:56,416 --> 00:27:00,208
to do, to do the

585
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:12,125
Yonna, the Wayunkeera

586
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,208
I want them ,

587
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:17,208
May they learn just as I am learning now.

588
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:20,666
and nothing more

589
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,291
Well

590
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:23,916
to close

591
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:26,000
When they ask me a lot about messages

592
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,333
It inspired me a lot.

593
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:30,375
she was picking up, exactly,

594
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:34,583
I was trying not to repeat myself because if I don't know,

595
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:37,666
I have a lot of love for my culture.

596
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:40,791
For example, I have had many opportunities

597
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:44,333
to do other things instead of dancing suddenly

598
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:48,625
my traditional dance of dancing folklore different cities,

599
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,041
champeta, reggaeton .

600
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,333
They have called me for contests,

601
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:56,250
but seeing the cultural crisis

602
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,041
that we are honestly going through,

603
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:01,125
Well, I feel like I can contribute my grain of sand.

604
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:04,000
from what I know how to do, from what I like,

605
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,833
which is dance, music.

606
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:07,416
Also my

607
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:10,375
know, learn, multiply what I know.

608
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:14,000
So my invitation is to love

609
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:17,500
what they have around them, regardless of whether they are Wayúu

610
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:22,583
or not. No, sometimes you can't imagine the spiritual connection

611
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:23,541
with nature

612
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:26,791
that has the different cultures here in our country,

613
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,458
and sometimes one gets careless.

614
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,916
For example, when we go to a city

615
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:32,708
we are very attentive to anything

616
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:35,208
because we don't know what meaning it has.

617
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:37,125
Then suddenly for those who come

618
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,541
from the outside, it would be very nice

619
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:40,500
Also, just as you who know,

620
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,000
who are interested in knowing

621
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,041
what does each thing mean ,

622
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:46,791
because that's how they also begin to respect it,

623
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,458
start taking care of her and they also start to love her.

624
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:49,958
And also

625
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:51,375
you who are not your own

626
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:53,375
Wayuu, you can contribute your grain of sand

627
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:55,250
To be able to make known what we are,

628
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:59,083
to continue strengthening everything we have, maintain it

629
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:00,250
and keep it .

630
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,083
We at this time

631
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:01,541
what we want

632
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:04,291
is to preserve that for future generations.

633
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:07,291
Then the invitation is also for you.

634
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:10,333
When he makes us known there, then let them remember us,

635
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:15,125
May they remember and they will always be welcome here.

636
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:19,416
May you also teach us

637
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,458
also.

638
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:26,250
And the last thing is if each of you can tell me

639
00:29:26,291 --> 00:29:29,541
yes we have permission to use this in the documentary

640
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:32,458
our what are they doing

641
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:35,791
recording , and first before publishing anything

642
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:39,916
We passed by you to verify, but

643
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:41,000
as I am.

644
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,375
already authorize and so

645
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:47,000

Ok here.

653
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:07,833
She is a minor

654
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:11,375
So I'm going to authorize it for her, since she's my little sister.
