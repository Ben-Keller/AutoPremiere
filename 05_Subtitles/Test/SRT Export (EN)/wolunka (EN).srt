1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Well Neko, you are entering the Macuira mountain range.
These are land of the Arpushana (family lineage)

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The story of Wolunka, happened in the land of the Arpushana.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Here is the stone where Wolunka was that
Day, as I told you.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
TRUE. In fact, in our culture it is necessary
let us know these stories

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So that we continue to value these wonders that we have now

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Since this is what our ancestors have left
and our grandparents

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's why I'm here in your territory Magalys.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
See I come from the west and now I'm here
in the north. Yeah.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Where the Wayuu people originated.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I am glad to know the place where Wolunka was.
We can talk a little more about that.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I am going to tell you then the story of Wolunka.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This here

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It is the stone of Wolunka, where he used to sit

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Wolunka was a very beautiful woman

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Who used to sit there while taking a bath in the afternoons

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And back then there were also two brothers

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
They were twins as they call it now.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But when they saw her bathe in the afternoons

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
they were scared and did not want to bathe near her
because of the teeth they saw in her vagina.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And they said "what could we do" because we won't have
descendants for her.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Since the men were afraid of him and of course,
she did have teeth in her vagina

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
None of the men wanted to get close to him for fear of
his teeth

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
One day.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Before, I clarified that Wolunka was Juya's daughter.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So, one day they sat down to think about what they should do.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Since they were worried about not leaving descendants, but with
Wolunka like that, you couldn't

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Said the twin brothers

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
As they talked.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
They decided then that they should knock out his teeth,
those of the vagina

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And they went looking for the arrow

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It was from up there where they shot the arrow
while bathing

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
In fact, there you can see his footprints when he
they shot the arrow

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Too bad we can't go up there

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Because there you can see the footprints of his Kou'su (shoes)

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The arrow that was thrown at him was right in his intimate part

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Which caused a great bleeding that
came to the lake

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Making the water red.

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Wolunka, for his part, left bleeding
and tormented by pain

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He went to his father Juya (rain)

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I told him what they did to him

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Then Juya got angry and went in search of the brothers

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But they fled immediately, they had
hidden in a cave

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
They hid from Father Juya because they knew
that he would be angry

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
by Wolunka

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
While they hid in the cave they were looking for them

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Juya divided the stones in two from the rage he had

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
They called at

48
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Birds

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So that they pecked at the cave where they were

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That explains why some birds have

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It has a short beak, an example of which is

52
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The bird Utta (bridged boob) Utta, yes Utta.

53
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
utta and the other

55
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That it's called

56
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This, the woodpecker too

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
From there, they chose utta, fuel that won out of all

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
To stipulate the matrilineal lineage, by which
we are organized now. Yeah.

59
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Because it was not only for the woman but for everyone

60
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So yeah, it was utta that won

61
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
he organized everything

62
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And of course I win out of all the birds

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I give the name to each one, he said this is Uriana,
This is Pausayu

64
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He was

65
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Who won. He was in charge of distributing the eirÃ¼ku
(family lineages) according to the accounts of the elders

66
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's why I remain engraved in the stone of destiny
as they say, there, at sword point

67
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Where now

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
They all go

69
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And those who enter or the one who enters

70
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
must pass

71
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Does the one who manages to pass the cave have a long life?

72
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, live for many years

73
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Whoever gets stuck won't live many years

74
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is the story of wolunka

75
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And after they knocked out his teeth
What happened to wolunka?

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
We have our families, now

77
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
we have our lineages

78
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
She bled a lot right? Yeah. Well, that's where it comes from.
menstruation in women so that we can ovulate

79
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
We already have children and we have multiplied on earth

80
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
If she hadn't knocked out her teeth

81
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We did not have ancestors, we did not exist, we would not multiply on earth

82
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This is how our ancestors have told us about the
Wolunka's story

83
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That is, our origin as a people is from Wolunka,
yes it was thanks to her

84
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It is very important to talk about it since many are unaware
of this story, yes.

85
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It is not so common to talk about these stories, as
Wolunka's, yes.

86
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
About the culture of us Wayuu. Even so, I know
Speak, the story is told

87
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
They come to see it.
has your name

88
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The water was red, it turned red

89
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It was very reddish, where

90
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Blood was spilled, yes, where I spill blood,
because I bleed a lot

91
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This is the story of wolunka, so that we
we existed and multiplied on earth

92
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Juya's daughter (rain)

93
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
the beautiful wolunka

94
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
From which we originate, from which we exist, yes.

95
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What else do you want to know.

96
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It is very interesting to hear everything you have told me

97
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If I am correct

98
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes of course.
Now.

99
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I am here in the north zone, to know about Wolunka,

100
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
To know

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
yes, how interesting

102
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
To know our origin. Yes, of us the Wayuu,
since ancient times.

103
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The thing related to wolunka, like that stone where he sat, right? If he sat there.

104
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, I used to see the images on sheets, too

105
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I also saw it on the phone until now

106
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I was like, I wish I could go there, but you're already here,
You already know it, you already saw it, we are already here and it is very good

107
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
There's always water, that's good, it's always cold

108
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They say that when people get close

109
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's like,

110
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
They felt the spiritual atmosphere of the place,

111
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
when someone arrives, a lot of spiritual energy is revived
in the place

112
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
If the environment is heavy, even some people
her spirit appears

113
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You hear sounds of her washing, at night, if you pass
around here, you hear as if bathing or swimming

114
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
She manifests herself like this, with whoever wants to listen to her

115
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Some like it and others don't.

116
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This place is sacred, right.

117
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
They call it sacred

118
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Or sacred site

119
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yes, and with this

120
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I say that I have learned, but just as I was there
many who still don't know

121
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And they need to know stories like this

122
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So that they recognize their value and importance within
of our culture

123
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So that they say and share what their lineage is,
how is represented

124
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Since we all have a lineage, yes.

125
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
For example, this is the territory of the Arpushana

126
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Instead, my territory is there, now we are going there
in Alewalu, where my grandmother is from

127
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It still has mangoes, where my grandmother has mangoes.
I always went to look for mangoes

128
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And Kayushipuna is my father's territory

129
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
AND

130
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
One day. When we arrived, my mom told me
âThere are still mangoes from my grandmother hereâ

131
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And my mom showed them to me

132
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
They came by donkey, sometimes 5 or 6 donkeys.

133
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
To take mango from here

134
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Although it is far away, we always come and suffer a lot

135
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Sometimes the mangoes fall on the road, yes.

136
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
There are still mangoes from my grandmother.

137
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
we are Pausayu from UsijoujeÂ´

138
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
same now let's

139
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
To see. That is, to see more places for them
learn more about our culture

140
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and that also

141
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It remains engraved, for the new generation

142
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Also for, children, yes children

143
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So we will continue exploring, of course, we must train
to the children and tell them what life was like for our ancestors

144
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So that they keep what we are, that they are not ashamed
of culture when they go to the city

145
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Totally true

146
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
They don't want to wear our clothes anymore, it embarrasses them,
they are going to wear pants when they leave

147
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That is why it is necessary to preserve what we are

148
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
we shouldn't be ashamed

149
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Rather, rather, the arijunas are more interested
(person who is not wayuu)

150
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
We don't care sometimes

151
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
We don't give it importance, if we are the ones
selfless and our children

152
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Because? Because of the technology, yes.

153
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That is the cause, as you already know the technology
children are no longer interested in anything

154
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
They no longer want to put on the blanket but pants, they are
cell phone earring

155
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That is why it is necessary to talk to the children, train them
and instill in them

156
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Values such as solidarity, because now being supportive
it is very necessary

157
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Solidarity is our greatest wealth

158
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Can't see a bit

159
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yes, you can see it, but it is prohibited

160
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
There are Maaiku's footprints when he injured Wolunka

161
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
where is it?

162
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's on the other side, up there? No, it's from the other side
for that rubble

163
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I thought it was from this side, how it came out of the water

164
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Not because it came from there and I threw it there

165
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
She was there, yes she was bathing

166
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So I throw it to her there, and she woke up with the wound, yes.
And He sat there, yes.

167
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
She went crying to father Juya,

168
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
bled out right there

169
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yes, she got to the water and of course, if they hurt her
right there that's why the blood reached the water

170
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
On that side, just below you can see the blood

171
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
They threw the date there, and the tracks can still be seen

172
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So it happened with Wolunka

173
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
this is mayo

174
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The mayo is like the soursop, with which juice is made

175
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
wild mayo

176
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
That is wild guanaba

177
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What do they say? Where are we going now?

178
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
For there, we continue, by car or walking, of course by car.

179
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What's the name of the place? alewalu
