00:01:22 - 00:01:26,"So we said now, letï¿½s move forward and see",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:01:26 - 00:01:30,This is a good initiative for the people of South Sudan,,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt

00:01:40 - 00:01:52,So I approached the ministry of education and introduced to them the Solar Spell library and how effective this would be to the Schools in South Sudan,,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:01:52 - 00:01:59,"So that our Students will be able to access textbooks and be able to perform well in their academics,-",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt

00:02:07 - 00:02:11,That they can use for reference and other things,,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:02:11 - 00:02:28,"And to make this library wealthier and better for use in schools, I requested the ministry of education to grant us permission of soft copies for secondary and primary educations, so that we can curate these books into the library",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt

00:02:52 - 00:02:59,"So, South Sudan became the first country to have its textbooks, soft copies textbooks in the library.",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:03:00 - 00:03:13,"So when we had them, we also approached the American embassy, in Juba to support us so that we can be able to have Solar Spell expanded in schools other the piloting schools",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:03:13 - 00:03:24,"So the American embassy was kind enough to give us a small funding, to expand the Solar Spell education library for the Schools, for Secondary schools",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:03:24 - 00:03:35,"And we on our path as the piloting South Sudan, we also extended to one primary schools and then another two secondary schools, on our capacity",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:03:35 - 00:03:50,"And then recently, we trained three more schools that we have given the Solar Spell education as well, so it makes a total of about nine schools right now that are using Solar Spell education",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:03:50 - 00:03:59,"And then again, with all weï¿½ve got, this is a good time for us to also let other people know and understand it.",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:04:00 - 00:04:04,Let them be trained on how to use the Solar Spell,,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:04:04 - 00:04:09,"Because giving Solar Spell to a school, training some few teachers is not enough",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:04:09 - 00:04:18,"Somebody might leave the school tomorrow and go somewhere, so we have to keep on training the teachers and training the students",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt

00:04:45 - 00:04:59,"Again, still with Solar Spell education, in 2020, after the emergence of Covid-19, the ministry of general education of the government of South Sudan introduced this in learning, were they engaged local radios to high-out lessons-",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt

00:05:08 - 00:05:13,"But if you listen to the radio and you donï¿½t have textbooks, it doesnï¿½t make sense",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:05:13 - 00:05:25,"It doesnï¿½t make any meaning, so it wonï¿½t be good if you can- This is the right time for us to share what we have, the technology that we have wish does not require internet, does not require power",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt

00:05:32 - 00:05:46,"So we engaged eight facilitators, we trained them at the Juba girls training center and then we send them out to communities, to locations where parents would come and download the textbooks and then they go and use them in the house for learning",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:05:46 - 00:05:54,"So they will be listening to the radio, and theyï¿½ll have a textbook with them to refer to, so that theyï¿½d be able to learn in the process",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:05:54 - 00:05:59,"So this was a very effective project, and it was funded by the American embassy as well.",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt

00:07:56 - 00:07:59,"Now this is your time to implement it,-",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:08:00 - 00:08:08,-so weï¿½re going to do the training with the staff in the institute and also the students on how to use the library,,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:08:08 - 00:08:17,"So, Iï¿½m looking on a bigger picture, itï¿½s not only training the institute, the student and teachers, but also maybe meeting the health authorities in the country",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:08:17 - 00:08:23,"In South Sudan we have 79 counties, and the 79 counties also have 79 health centers",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:08:23 - 00:08:38,"We are lacking electricity, lacking textbooks, so this is an opportunity for them to have access to this library, so they use them for reference to be able to offer adequate, efficient and effective health services to our people in the country",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:08:38 - 00:08:52,Iï¿½m going to meet with the health authorities to discuss with them and demonstrate to them what the Solar Spell Health is all about and how it works and how it would help the people of South Sudan,,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:08:52 - 00:08:59,They will take up from there and see how effective this thing will be for us and Iï¿½m very sure 100%.,,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:09:00 - 00:09:04,Itï¿½s also going to work well as we did with education Solar Spell library,,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt

00:09:35 - 00:09:52,"Hakim: Yeah, basically and sincerely speaking, I donï¿½t have a health background, but as someone who leaves in South Sudan and as seen the situation, and I have kids, and I have family that needs health services, I do believe that the issues of health information is lacking",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:09:52 - 00:09:59,"And when the health information is lacking, this is where the Solar Spell Health come in with lots of health resources.",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:10:00 - 00:10:03,The Second thing that is also lacking is internet,,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt

00:10:15 - 00:10:28,"So it solves the issue of the internet, because youï¿½d have the resources accessed using your mobile phone, a tablet and talking about mobile phones, thatï¿½s also an issue",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:10:28 - 00:10:45,"Itï¿½s a big thing as well but I do believe that as technology is evolving and as devices are coming and the country is developing, majority of people are starting to get resources and devices especially in urban areas",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:10:45 - 00:10:59,"So for us to address the rural areas, other institutions, international organization and the government, should come in and maybe have access, buy some resource in devices, and distribute to all these health centers.",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:11:00 - 00:11:05,So that health practitioners would be able to have devices to access the resources for the library,,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:11:05 - 00:11:17,"So I see it as a challenge and I see it also as an opportunity for the authorities and well-wishers to come in and have these devices available to all the practitioners, which is a possibility",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:11:17 - 00:11:27,"And when you have something, if you have food and you talk about what do I eat food with? You canï¿½t wait for what to eat food with when youï¿½re hungry",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt

00:11:31 - 00:11:36,"So, whatever is available to be use to access the resources will always be there",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:11:36 - 00:11:47,The most important thing is availability of the information that we need to have to be able to have the practitioners to be able to remind themselves about the information they have forgotten,,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:11:47 - 00:11:59,"When you have the library around you, you browse what you want, you even remind yourself what you have learnt, though you donï¿½t have the physical textbook, but you have the textbook and the information offline through the library.",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:12:00 - 00:12:16,"Those are the few challenges that we have but I see them as an opportunity, because if we look at them, and see how better we can address them- Are easily addressed if we look at the point",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:12:16 - 00:12:33,"Ben: So, Hakim, why where you specifically invited to join this delegation coming to Malawi? Why were you on the team here? Hakim: One, I find myself as part and parcel of the team that is implementing the Solar Spell in Africa",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt

00:12:42 - 00:12:59,"And I do believe that coming here, having the glimpse of what Solar Spell is all about, from the beginning few years ago, and then having training on the Solar Spell Health, would create a bigger impact back home in the country.",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:13:00 - 00:13:07,"Solar Spell health was not introduced officially in South Sudan, because we did not have Solar Spell Health library before",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:13:07 - 00:13:38,"Now that we have it, it is the right time for myself to come, attend the training and understand how the Solar Spell Health works as I understood how the Solar Spell Education works, then take the same knowledge and skills back home to the country and then empower the knowledge to other in South Sudan, So that we expand the implementation of Solar Spell Health across South Sudan and east Africa in particular in the region",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt

00:14:11 - 00:14:23,"So, yeah, itï¿½s a big thing, not about South Sudan only but about having the knowledge and then spreading it all over the world and especially in east Africa region",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:14:23 - 00:14:23,Thank you,,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt

00:14:40 - 00:14:51,"If not 20% of the whole population leaves in the urban areas, but the 80% or maybe 75%, 75-80% of the population in Africa lives in rural areas",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt

00:15:00 - 00:15:03,-implementation of Solar Spell education or Solar Spell initiatives,,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
00:15:03 - 00:15:23,"So, to look at 80% of Africa, if we have the accessibility and the efforts and the forces to send all these devices to all these 80% of our population in Africa, this would be a bigger change of lives across Africa because it is unlimited in remote areas",,../Interview TXT\Hakim 1 Interview.txt
