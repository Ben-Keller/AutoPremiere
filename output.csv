at kuhes that is kamuzu university of health sciences.,hakim,ENGLISH,,
i’m excited to be here,hakim,ENGLISH,,
for the first time in malawi.,hakim,ENGLISH,,
i find myself as a pioneer,hakim,ENGLISH,,
of the implementation of solarspell library in africa,hakim,ENGLISH,,
and especially in south sudan.,hakim,ENGLISH,,
i anticipate that solar spell,hakim,ENGLISH,,
would reach to all these populations in across africa.,hakim,ENGLISH,,
"solar spell health, solar spell education,",hakim,ENGLISH,,
because of how it is designed.,hakim,ENGLISH,,
it is designed to use our natural resource,hakim,ENGLISH,,
that we have and that is the sun.,hakim,ENGLISH,,
"if you look at africa,",hakim,ENGLISH,,
75-80% of the population in africa lives in rural areas.,hakim,ENGLISH,,
basically that means these are areas,hakim,ENGLISH,,
"where there is no electricity, there is no internet.",hakim,ENGLISH,,
"so, this is a suitable space for the",hakim,ENGLISH,,
implementation of solar spell initiatives.,hakim,ENGLISH,,
"if we work hard,",hakim,ENGLISH,,
"we join hands together,",hakim,ENGLISH,,
different countries and join force together,hakim,ENGLISH,,
"and have the knowledge about the solar spell,",hakim,ENGLISH,,
"then, we can be able to reach",hakim,ENGLISH,,
about 80% of the african population.,hakim,ENGLISH,,
"to share what we have,",hakim,ENGLISH,,
the technology that we have which,hakim,ENGLISH,,
"does not require internet,",hakim,ENGLISH,,
does not require power.,hakim,ENGLISH,,
"my name is laura hosman,",hosman,ENGLISH,,
i am assistant professor at arizona state university,hosman,ENGLISH,,
and the school for the future of innovation and society,hosman,ENGLISH,,
and at the polytechnic school.,hosman,ENGLISH,,
i launched solar spell,hosman,ENGLISH,,
to bring educational content to places,hosman,ENGLISH,,
around the globe that don’t have,hosman,ENGLISH,,
"electricity, internet, libraries",hosman,ENGLISH,,
or access to valuable educational information.,hosman,ENGLISH,,
having access to information means,hosman,ENGLISH,,
being able to make more empowering decisions,hosman,ENGLISH,,
about one's life.,hosman,ENGLISH,,
libraries are also traditionally a place of community.,hosman,ENGLISH,,
i also believe that we can,hosman,ENGLISH,,
build community with a digital library.,hosman,ENGLISH,,
that's one of the reasons,hosman,ENGLISH,,
that we started working at schools.,hosman,ENGLISH,,
i anticipate that solar spell would reach,hakim,ENGLISH,,
to all these populations in across africa.,hakim,ENGLISH,,
"solar spell health, solar spell education,",hakim,ENGLISH,,
i'm anticipating having all the solar spell,hakim,ENGLISH,,
"libraries across africa in remote areas, particularly.",hakim,ENGLISH,,
the moment you come to,hakim,ENGLISH,,
the demonstration on the solar spell,hakim,ENGLISH,,
"and how it works,",hakim,ENGLISH,,
"and how you can access the books,",hakim,ENGLISH,,
you can even see the faces,hakim,ENGLISH,,
and the smiles you see on the people.,hakim,ENGLISH,,
it’s because they know that this,hakim,ENGLISH,,
is what we have been waiting for.,hakim,ENGLISH,,
"to them, they know",hakim,ENGLISH,,
"this is what we have been waiting for,",hakim,ENGLISH,,
we want to have it.,hakim,ENGLISH,,
i'm dr. heather ross.,ross,ENGLISH,,
i'm a professor of nursing at arizona state university.,ross,ENGLISH,,
i teach things like health equity,ross,ENGLISH,,
and social justice,ross,ENGLISH,,
and global health policy.,ross,ENGLISH,,
"we are in malawi, in blantyre.",ross,ENGLISH,,
we're here because,ross,ENGLISH,,
our solar spell health library,ross,ENGLISH,,
is going out into the field,ross,ENGLISH,,
for the first time.,ross,ENGLISH,,
the kamuzu university of health sciences,ross,ENGLISH,,
has partnered with the peace corps,ross,ENGLISH,,
and with solar spell,ross,ENGLISH,,
to be our very first pilot,ross,ENGLISH,,
of the solar spell health library in africa.,ross,ENGLISH,,
so what's in the library?,ross,ENGLISH,,
all kinds of reference materials.,ross,ENGLISH,,
"we have a medical encyclopedia,",ross,ENGLISH,,
we have textbooks.,ross,ENGLISH,,
we have all kinds of videos,ross,ENGLISH,,
"for healthcare professionals,",ross,ENGLISH,,
but also for people in the community.,ross,ENGLISH,,
"and of course,",ross,ENGLISH,,
"we can't say it enough,",ross,ENGLISH,,
a library is never done.,ross,ENGLISH,,
so it's always growing.,ross,ENGLISH,,
"nursing school is really, really, needed",patrick,ENGLISH,,
here in malawi,patrick,ENGLISH,,
as far as health issues are concerned.,patrick,ENGLISH,,
"we have so many hospitals around malawi,",patrick,ENGLISH,,
"but then the health workers are just very few,",patrick,ENGLISH,,
we have a number of diseases,patrick,ENGLISH,,
that people do suffer here in malawi.,patrick,ENGLISH,,
"so for them to get better,",patrick,ENGLISH,,
"for them to get treated,",patrick,ENGLISH,,
we need a huge task force,patrick,ENGLISH,,
that will be there each and every time,patrick,ENGLISH,,
to give you support,patrick,ENGLISH,,
and to give treatment to those patients.,patrick,ENGLISH,,
"my name is patrick somanje,",patrick,ENGLISH,,
i’m the president for student representative council.,patrick,ENGLISH,,
i’m doing bachelors of science in nursing and midwifery.,patrick,ENGLISH,,
…..,patrick,ENGLISH,,
most of the challenges here,patrick,ENGLISH,,
for students are financial issues.,patrick,ENGLISH,,
i understand each and every student is,patrick,ENGLISH,,
"supposed to buy his or her own meals daily,",patrick,ENGLISH,,
so it becomes a challenge for most of the students.,patrick,ENGLISH,,
"as a result, most of the students do not take meals,",patrick,ENGLISH,,
"maybe 3 to 4 days,",patrick,ENGLISH,,
maybe they just take tea,patrick,ENGLISH,,
in the morning and then off they go.,patrick,ENGLISH,,
"in terms of having learning resources,",patrick,ENGLISH,,
"it has become hard,",patrick,ENGLISH,,
"because for a student to buy a laptop,",patrick,ENGLISH,,
it’s not easy.,patrick,ENGLISH,,
and then our library is full of old books.,patrick,ENGLISH,,
"the coming of this solar spell,",patrick,ENGLISH,,
it exactly will answer to some of the problems,patrick,ENGLISH,,
"that students have,",patrick,ENGLISH,,
"because they’ll be able to get information,",patrick,ENGLISH,,
they'll be able to have any sort of books,patrick,ENGLISH,,
that they need through this solar spell library.,patrick,ENGLISH,,
these academic issues are dynamics.,patrick,ENGLISH,,
they do changes it every day.,patrick,ENGLISH,,
so it means that solar spell needs to be,patrick,ENGLISH,,
"updated time and again,",patrick,ENGLISH,,
so i just want you to devise the ways,patrick,ENGLISH,,
on how this will be timely updated,patrick,ENGLISH,,

we’ll be answering the questions.,chrissy/love,ENGLISH,,
we’ll be stars.,chrissy/love,ENGLISH,,

human equity and health equity,ross,ENGLISH,,
when we get information and the knowledge,ross,ENGLISH,,

i guess that i could bring it back,hosman,ENGLISH,,
