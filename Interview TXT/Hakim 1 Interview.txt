Hakmin: My name is Hakim Monykuer Awuok. I am the program consultant for empower kids South Sudan. It�s a non-profit organization that founded by an American business man called Ed Eisele in the US in 2014 and we established it in South Sudan. And in 2018, I had an email from Ed, the founder of the organization to meet a team from Solar Spell that where coming from Arizona State University to meet in Rwanda in 2018. So, I and some teachers that were selected from some schools in South Sudan went to Rwanda for a training on Solar Spell education. So we had a training, then we came back-
[00:01:00]
-to South Sudan to do the piloting in different schools. And one of the schools was Yambio and another one is Rumbek Secondary School, Juba Girls Secondary school, and then the implementation was done, and there was a success that was registered after the piloting of the Solar Spell library in South Sudan. So we said now, let�s move forward and see. This is a good initiative for the people of South Sudan. Textbooks are limited. In schools, there are not enough textbooks, so this is the right time to have this success to the educative resources. So I approached the ministry of education and introduced to them the Solar Spell library and how effective this would be to the Schools in South Sudan. So that our Students will be able to access textbooks and be able to perform well in their academics,-
[00:02:00]
-and also help the teacher to get more additional resources that would help them to teach in the schools. That they can use for reference and other things. And to make this library wealthier and better for use in schools, I requested the ministry of education to grant us permission of soft copies for secondary and primary educations, so that we can curate these books into the library. I was thankful enough that the minister of education was excited, the minister, the[inaudible] were excited about this project, and they happily gave us the permission to get the soft copies of the South Sudan, new South Sudan textbooks. So I sent the soft copies to the Solar Spell team in the US, where they were curated into the library. So, South Sudan became the first country to have its textbooks, soft copies textbooks in the library. 
[00:03:00]
So when we had them, we also approached the American embassy, in Juba to support us so that we can be able to have Solar Spell expanded in schools other the piloting schools. So the American embassy was kind enough to give us a small funding, to expand the Solar Spell education library for the Schools, for Secondary schools. And we on our path as the piloting South Sudan, we also extended to one primary schools and then another two secondary schools, on our capacity. And then recently, we trained three more schools that we have given the Solar Spell education as well, so it makes a total of about nine schools right now that are using Solar Spell education. And then again, with all we�ve got, this is a good time for us to also let other people know and understand it. 
[00:04:00]
Let them be trained on how to use the Solar Spell. Because giving Solar Spell to a school, training some few teachers is not enough. Somebody might leave the school tomorrow and go somewhere, so we have to keep on training the teachers and training the students. So, in this purpose, we initiated- The empower kids South Sudan together with Arizona State University Solar Spell team, we initiated to establish as teacher training Solar Spell training center, with is based right now at Juba girls secondary school. So this is where teachers are brought in, they�re trained on how to use Solar Spell and then we dispatch them to go outside and use Solar Spell. Again, still with Solar Spell education, in 2020, after the emergence of Covid-19, the ministry of general education of the government of South Sudan introduced this in learning, were they engaged local radios to high-out lessons-
[00:05:00]
-to the public, so that student can continue to learn as we remain in the lockdown.
So when we realized that students will listen to the radio. But if you listen to the radio and you don�t have textbooks, it doesn�t make sense. It doesn�t make any meaning, so it won�t be good if you can- This is the right time for us to share what we have, the technology that we have wish does not require internet, does not require power. You have to use the nature of sun that we have to power the device, so that they can be able to access the library. So we engaged eight facilitators, we trained them at the Juba girls training center and then we send them out to communities, to locations where parents would come and download the textbooks and then they go and use them in the house for learning. So they will be listening to the radio, and they�ll have a textbook with them to refer to, so that they�d be able to learn in the process. So this was a very effective project, and it was funded by the American embassy as well. 
[00:06:00]
So it succeeded very well and we had thousands of textbooks downloaded, and as soon as we download the textbooks, that was very helpful. We went to the radio and also evaluated how the things were working,and people were calling and giving us appreciation for what we have done. 
That was, we came at the right time to bring the Solar Spell, at this time during the Covid-19. So it�s a very good success. It�s a registered success and we look forward to a better future for Solar Spell now in South Sudan as we move forward to implementing. Why I came a week ago to Malawi, was to learn another Solar Spell library which is Solar Spell Health, which is also which is also a key issue. It�s a key topic in the country. We have issues of Health problems and we have issues of resources for health practitioners to use for the reference and as they continue to treat patients in South Sudan.
[00:07:00]
So, when I attended the training, it was a very effective training, I�m excited and I look forward to a future Solar Spell has in South Sudan. Initially there was an introduction, a brief introduction, about how Solar Spell would come. That was in 2019 when the team came to South Sudan, and we went to the- Then it used to be called Juba school of nursing, which has now changed to St. Mary Health Science institute. So going back for here with the knowledge, the intention is to start where we start started in the beginning that is the St. Mary. We�re going to conduct trainings in St. Mary Health Science institute, and then empower the knowledge of the library and show them that this is what we started before. You were part of the beginning, now it�s ready, ready to be use. Now this is your time to implement it,- 
[00:08:00]
-so we�re going to do the training with the staff in the institute and also the students on how to use the library. So, I�m looking on a bigger picture, it�s not only training the institute, the student and teachers, but also maybe meeting the health authorities in the country. In South Sudan we have 79 counties, and the 79 counties also have 79 health centers. We are lacking electricity, lacking textbooks, so this is an opportunity for them to have access to this library, so they use them for reference to be able to offer adequate, efficient and effective health services to our people in the country. I�m going to meet with the health authorities to discuss with them and demonstrate to them what the Solar Spell Health is all about and how it works and how it would help the people of South Sudan. They will take up from there and see how effective this thing will be for us and I�m very sure 100%. 
[00:09:00]
It�s also going to work well as we did with education Solar Spell library. So I look forward to a better future for Solar Spell Health in the country, and I�ll push it forward maybe in one year or so, you�ll be able to hear some good results on what we�ve done so far.
Ben: So, Hakim, 
Hakim: Yeah, thank you.
Ben: So as far as nursing in South Sudan, what are those challenges that you face specifically that you thing Solar Spell can help address? So, why do you thing Solar Spell is specifically valuable in the nursing Space.
Hakim: Yeah, basically and sincerely speaking, I don�t have a health background, but as someone who leaves in South Sudan and as seen the situation, and I have kids, and I have family that needs health services, I do believe that the issues of health information is lacking. And when the health information is lacking, this is where the Solar Spell Health come in with lots of health resources.
[00:10:00]
The Second thing that is also lacking is internet. There is no internet in the country and the good thing is Solar Spell comes as an offline library, were you don�t even worry about the internet. So it solves the issue of the internet, because you�d have the resources accessed using your mobile phone, a tablet and talking about mobile phones, that�s also an issue. It�s a big thing as well but I do believe that as technology is evolving and as devices are coming and the country is developing, majority of people are starting to get resources and devices especially in urban areas. So for us to address the rural areas, other institutions, international organization and the government, should come in and maybe have access, buy some resource in devices, and distribute to all these health centers. 
[00:11:00]
So that health practitioners would be able to have devices to access the resources for the library. So I see it as a challenge and I see it also as an opportunity for the authorities and well-wishers to come in and have these devices available to all the practitioners, which is a possibility. And when you have something, if you have food and you talk about what do I eat food with?
You can�t wait for what to eat food with when you�re hungry. You can eat the food right now, and then something to eat with will follow. So, whatever is available to be use to access the resources will always be there. The most important thing is availability of the information that we need to have to be able to have the practitioners to be able to remind themselves about the information they have forgotten. When you have the library around you, you browse what you want, you even remind yourself what you have learnt, though you don�t have the physical textbook, but you have the textbook and the information offline through the library. 
[00:12:00]
Those are the few challenges that we have but I see them as an opportunity, because if we look at them, and see how better we can address them- Are easily addressed if we look at the point.
Ben: So, Hakim, why where you specifically invited to join this delegation coming to Malawi? Why were you on the team here?
Hakim: One, I find myself as part and parcel of the team that is implementing the Solar Spell in Africa. I find myself as a pioneer of the implementation of Solar Spell library in Africa and especially in South Sudan. And I do believe that coming here, having the glimpse of what Solar Spell is all about, from the beginning few years ago, and then having training on the Solar Spell Health, would create a bigger impact back home in the country. 
[00:13:00]
Solar Spell health was not introduced officially in South Sudan, because we did not have Solar Spell Health library before. Now that we have it, it is the right time for myself to come, attend the training and understand how the Solar Spell Health works as I understood how the Solar Spell Education works, then take the same knowledge and skills back home to the country and then empower the knowledge to other in South Sudan, So that we expand the implementation of Solar Spell Health across South Sudan and east Africa in particular in the region. Having this knowledge will not limit me to South Sudan only. I�ll be able to extend to other part of countries in east Africa. 
If there is a training that needs to be done, to be conducted in Ethiopia, to be conducted in Kenya, to be conducted in Uganda, and any other neighboring country like Rwanda,-
[00:14:00]
- I will not hesitate to come there because I have the knowledge to teach other countries, on how this Solar Spell would be effective in saving lives in those countries. So, yeah, it�s a big thing, not about South Sudan only but about having the knowledge and then spreading it all over the world and especially in east Africa region. Thank you.
Ben: What scale do you see it reaching in Africa? How communities do you think it can reach and how many people it [could?]-
Hakim: If you look at Africa, African Urban centers maybe about- I don�t know the statistics but maybe about 30%. If not 20% of the whole population leaves in the urban areas, but the 80% or maybe 75%, 75-80% of the population in Africa lives in rural areas. Basically that means these are areas where there is no electricity, there is no internet. So, this is a suitable space for the-
[00:15:00]
-implementation of Solar Spell education or Solar Spell initiatives. So, to look at 80% of Africa, if we have the accessibility and the efforts and the forces to send all these devices to all these 80% of our population in Africa, this would be a bigger change of lives across Africa because it is unlimited in remote areas. You�d have the library at any time you want. You charge it- You know, Africa has about 70% of satellites in Africa, if not 80%. If there are 70% of satellites in remove areas, this will not limit the Africans that are in remote areas to have access. So I�m talking about 70%. If we work hard, we join hands together, different countries and join force together and have the knowledge about the Solar Spell, then, we can be able to reach to about 80% of the African population. 
[00:16:00]
That would be a big dream if we do that.
Ben: Wonderful. Yeah. Really a big dream. Can you quickly talk about the delegation you�re here with, the group that you�re visiting with? The professors and-
Hakim: Yeah, the group I�m visiting with is the team coming from Arizona State University. They are comprised of the founders of the Solar Spell initiative, the professors who are also professors of the faculties in Arizona State University, together with the team, with the students who are also volunteers for the Solar Spell, who have been very instrumental in ensuring that the Solar Spell Succeeds. And Success of Solar Spell, to me, I credit this to the students and basically the professors who have done the job to do it. So yeah, these are the brains of the Solar Spell that I�m here with. 
[00:17:00]
So I�m really excited that I�m together with the team that came from Arizona State University, to come and train us together with the Malawian people on how to use the Solar Spell. It is exciting to be with the team of Arizona State University and be part of the change in Africa. 
Ben: Amazing.
Hakim: Thank you.
Ben: I think we can ask a few more questions and I think we should also do another follow up interview this evening, maybe at the hotel we can-
Hakim: Sure.
Ben: Since it�s a little hot outside here. It�s good to breakup. So I guess, just now, is there anything else that on top of your mind that you want to speaks to?  
Hakim: I think one thing is I want to thank you as a team. It is exciting to be with you especially being in [00:17:55][inaudible] for all this record,- 
[00:18:00]
- and getting the message for Solar Spell out to the people out there. What I would say is the world is pushing it enough to have Arizona State University and the students and the teachers to come up with this initiative. The faculty and the students, to come up with this initiative, this is a life changing opportunity for people who are less privileged especially in parts of Africa where they don�t have access to a lot of infrastructures. So, if this gets out- And it requires us, all of us who have got access to this library to make maximum use of this library and to it to what was initiated, innovated to change lives. We must embrace it with our hearts and with our minds and our fashion, and take it to where it�s needed, so that we save a lot of lives in Africa. So it is a life changing opportunity for us. 
[00:19:00]
And especially for me to be part of it, so I�d not reserve any efforts or energy to ensure that it succeeds in Africa. Thank you.
Ben: Amazing. Really quick one more time, can you say your name and every little detail you can get for me?
Hakim: Yeah, again, my name is Hakim Monykuer Awuok, I�m a program consultant for empower kids South Sudan. It�s a non-profit organization that we registered in 2014 in South Sudan. It�s a registered institution in South Sudan that is implementing several activities. We are basically dealing on education, where are sending students to [00:19:40][inaudible] to run the program- For University graduate program were they get the scholarships and then they go to the U.S. We have about 38 students so far in the program. Some of them have graduated and came back and are working now South Sudan, and we are also providing sanitary kits to less privileged girls in high schools,- 
[00:20:00]
- so that we retain them in the schools, so they should be able to continue to learn because education is for everybody, girls and male and female. So that�s one of the things. Initially, we had initiated peace essay contest for students in high school, so that they write about peace, how they want a peaceful South Sudan to look like. They wrote several amazing articles that we normally publish on the newspapers, and I believe that this has changed lives of those who have read them. I think it has started the conversation about peace in the country. Yeah, I�m excited to continue to serve the public.
Ben: A very final thing. If you could just say where we are right now, the location we�re at.
Hakim: currently, we are in Balanta Malawi, at KUHeS that is Kamuzu University of Health sciences in Malawi where we are doing-
[00:21:00]
-the second part of the training in Malawi, we did the first training in Lilongwe and now the second part of the training which is the last part of the training, we�re doing today, today is the 26th of January 2023, and this is the last day we�re doing the training in Malawi in Balanta at KUHeS which is Kamuzu University of Health sciences. Yeah, I�m excited to be here for the first time in Malawi.
[00:22:00]
