00:00 – 00:02
Where are you from Neko?

00:03 – 00:06
I am from a territory called Akualü

00:07 – 00:10
Although the elders call it Manaure

00:11 – 00:16
Ah, you come from the Wild West and now you are here.

00:18 – 00:21
In Nazareth or corregimiento de Nazareth as they call it

00:22 – 00:30***
We are in the territory of Usijou´, in Alewalü.
I don't know if you've heard that it's a sacred place.

00:31 – 00:36***
Yes, it is the only one with some characteristics
different natural

00:39 – 00:45
Yes of course. My grandmother and my mother's grandmother were from here.

00:47 – 00:51
Where is the sea? yes, over there, from here you can see the sea

00:52 – 00:56
Yes it's true.
yes they lived here

00:57 – 01:01
But the sea is far from here? Yes, you are far.

01:02 - 01:09***
They said they moved, they had left their
things as you can see
 
01:10 - 01:18***
There where the pieces of amuchi (ceramic) are,
are their ancestral remains (bone)
 
01:19 - 01:27***
They decided to go to the seashore because
They say that they were already bored here.
 
01:28 - 01:33***
So they left, but they came back again. Yeah. right here
 
01:35 - 01:42***
This was what you were talking about, right? Yeah.
I can touch it? No. It is forbidden

01:43 - 01:49***
You can't touch it, you can only see it. if you touch it
you can get sick

01:51 – 01:58***
When you touch it you take the energies of the dead
that can cause you harm

02:00 – 02:02***
Same with your arrival here

02:03 – 02:09***
TRUE. You must harmonize with the territory because we
surround the souls of those who lived here

02:10 – 02:18***
This belongs to them right? Yes, that's why their souls
they are here because those are their belongings

02:21 - 02:28***
This was their territory and they said that no one can.
take part of this sand
 
02:29 - 02:36***
Then we Pausayu arrived to inhabit it
 
02:37 - 02:40
I understand. And what did they bring from the sea?

02:41 - 02:46***
The sand, they threw it here so that it would stay that way.

02:47 - 02:53
That is to say, they brought the sand from the beach in
this piece of desert

02:56 - 03:03
The old say that through a dream they were told
to bring the sand from there

03:04 – 03:07
I'm telling you so you can say it, this part
then they cut it

03:08 - 03:12
Guille said that in the dream they were told
the next

03:13 – 03:18
That, if they loved this land so much, it could bring the
earth to here

03:19 - 03:26
and that they did. This is how this place originates

03:27 – 03:34
You could say that. that started from a dream
and so on

03:39 - 03:48***
So they brought him here, right? Yeah.
They brought it little by little until it spread
 
03:49 - 03:58***
As you can see this before this was small, but after
they were expanding it up there
  
03:59 - 04:05
Yes, now I understand. How nice to know the story
behind this
  
04:06 - 04:10***
Yes of course, in fact, all this that is here
it is also beautiful
 
04:13 - 04:21***
Yeah. It is very good to make known what
We have it because it is part of our Wayuu culture.
   
04:22 - 04:29***
You already know that in La Guajira there is this place, Alewalü
will be recognized by the world
 
04:30 - 04:37***
Through stories like these they will know not only
the place but its spirituality

04:38 - 04:45***
Since there are also many jewels of
the deceased
  
04:46 - 04:52***
That is why it is a sacred place because here are the
things of those who created it
  
04:55 - 05:03
People say that here in the north is where
are the most sacred places

05:04 - 05:07
And that is why it is important to make them known. Yes of course.

05:08 - 05:15
Well, thank you very much for what you shared with us.
Thank you anyway for coming
  
05:16 - 05:20
For coming from so far to know our territory.
   
05:22 - 05:29***
After winter it doesn't bloom here? No,
Does it stay like this? Yes of course, it gets wet and that's it
  
05:30 - 05:38***
the animals walk and do not get their feet wet.
You see there is no grass. No.
    
05:39 - 05:45***
And if it rains a lot? It may rain a lot but still.
it does not bloom because it is a sacred place
 
05:46 - 05:47
the territory is sacred
   
05:48 - 05:55***
That was destined. Yes, that's why they were created
ancestors who saw here

05:56 – 06:02
The people who come to Nazareth say that their
ancestors son of here too

06:03 – 06:11
Those from Dusakawi (health association) said that their
grandmothers told them that they have ancestors here

06:14 - 06:22
They say they will come back here again.
Yes, that's OK
  
06:23 - 06:31
It seems good to me that they come again so that
know more, we make them climb the mountains
 
06:32 - 06:39***
Yes, we have to arrive earlier, look how they are rushing us. Yes, it is true, it is complex.
 
06:40 - 06:47***
Because it is already getting dark and we already have
to leave because of how sacred it is
 
06:48 - 06:50
You are in Alewalü in the Alewalü Dunes
   
06:51 – 06:54
Smile smile. Stretch your hands. That
