***Moselantja 
My grandma always says to me,  “Bocha ke palesa”.
“Bocha ke palesa”.


She says it means that youth are the future,
and we represent hope.


And, she says my education is the most important thing
Because it is how hope is made real


### Moselantja
My name is Moselantja,
and I live at Ha Masupeli and I am 13 years old.


It is a beautiful village 
because it has the trees, the mountains,  
the clean cars, also mountains as well.


***Grandma
What I would like to do with Moselantja 
is for us to live in peace. 
Peace means peaceful life within the family. 


Let us be people who live well in peace.


My name is Matsele Selikane. 
I live at Ha Masupeli with my two grandchildren, 
Thabiso and Moselantja.


I love Moselantja because she is a very intelligent child. 
She is also a child who loves 
and enjoys school with all her heart.


The challenges we face in the country 
of Lesotho is the lack of jobs, 
then life becomes difficult when 
a person does not work. 


I have faced many challenges while raising children 
because of our lack of food. 


###Moselantja
My grandmother's name is Mati.
I like to live with my grandmother 
because my grandmother 
shows me the way of living.


She teaches me the way 
our food has always been cooked. 


Dinner time is when I miss my parents most.
I wish they could be sitting at the table 
with me so I can tell them about my day.


My parent, They are not here 
because they are at work in South Africa 
and send her money to do 
everything that we don't have. 
My Parents come one of the year of month, 
and I miss them a lot. 
But it's been so long time. 
But they come there every December time.  


I think my parents would say 
they are proud of me because I know English.


And I want to discover more about my culture, 
what it means to be Mesotho, from Lesotho.




***Moselantja
I wake up every morning to go to school 
and learn something new.


My father brought home a book
About the clans of Lesotho
I’m from the Bafokeng clan


add in her sesotho explanation of the bafokeng clan


I find I connect closely with the meaning to my clan.
It connects me to the generations that came before me.
And those that will come after.
It makes me proud to be a Masotho woman.


***Grandma
My family is important to me and 
I would love to see it shine some day. 
The message that I can give to my grandchildren
is to stay in school. 
It is one thing that will give them a bright future.


I want my grandchildren to get a different education
than the one I was given a long time ago, 
because I don't want them to be illiterate like me. 


I have done school only up to the sixth grade.


I would like Moselentja to finish university education 
so she can get a job of her choice.
When she finishes school, 
she will decide for herself 
what she wants to be in life.


***Moselantja
I am passionate about school 
because I care about people 
and I want to help others.


When I grow up, 
I want to be a human rights lawyer 
because I think everyone should be free.


I will support my family 
and I will make sure that they have home 
to live in and food to eat.
I want to support my parents because, 
they too, they supported me when I was still young.


***Sello
My name is Makopano Sello. 
I work here as a cook. 
I have five kids who attend school here.


Cooking is how I get all of my earnings
With that money I manage to buy 
food, clothes for my kids 
and also buy school books for them. 
Our lives depend on this job.


It is important for children 
to get food at school 
because some of them only eat at school, 
due to lack of food at home. 


***Matseliso
My name is MamatS`eliso Ranthako. 
I am the headmaster at Serooeng Primary School.


The challenges I face in teaching are many.


For example, 
some children come from poor families, 
some are orphans, 
some don't have school uniforms.


Also, some children go to school 
without learning materials.
We don't have enough educational resources 
To all the help students.
We have no equipment at all.
One of the challenges is that 
the last school equipment 
was given here in the year 1990.


***Rethabile
My name is Rethabile Sekote.


I work here at Serooeng Primary, as a teacher.


Moselantja is one of my students in grade seven.


I’ve been teaching her for five years, since grade three 


A teacher is a very important person because if the teacher is not there, there is no soldier, there is no teacher, there is no prime minister, there are no academics at all.


***Matseliso
I love teaching 
because I love working with the younger generation. 
Youth are the future of every country.


I started teaching when 
I was twenty-two years old. 
I have been a teacher for forty years.


The person who inspired me to 
become a teacher is Mr Mothuntsane Moremoholo. 
He loves hard working people.


***Moremoholo
When you are a teacher, 
you are a parent to children, 
and you should guide them.


The future of children 
is in the hands of the teacher.


My name is Mothunts`ane Joseph Moremoholo. 
I have been a teacher for fifty-two years. 
I started teaching in the year 1962.


And in the year 1988 
I came to teach here in Serooeng. 


It is said that no government branch 
exists without the teacher. 


The teacher is the mother 
of the governments that exist today. 
And by it governments can rise or fall. 
There are no governments except the teacher.


###Hakim
When we educate youth, 
we are building a capacity of people 
that will stay in a country 
and save a lot of lives 
And be the future leaders of tomorrow.


Hi, My name is Hakim Monykuer Awuok.
Currently, we are in Blantyre Malawi, 
at KUHeS that is Kamuzu University of Health Sciences.
I’m excited to be here 
for the first time in Malawi.
I find myself as a pioneer 
of the implementation of SolarSpell library in Africa 
and especially in South Sudan.


I anticipate that Solar Spell 
would reach to all these populations in across Africa. 
Solar Spell Health, Solar Spell education, 
because of how it is designed. 
It is designed to use our natural resource 
that we have and that is the sun. 


If you look at Africa, 
75-80% of the population in Africa lives in rural areas. 
Basically that means these are areas 
where there is no electricity, there is no internet. 
So, this is a suitable space for the 
implementation of Solar Spell initiatives.


If we work hard, 
we join hands together, 
different countries and join force together 
and have the knowledge about the Solar Spell, 
then, we can be able to reach 
about 80% of the African population. 
To share what we have, 
the technology that we have which 
does not require internet, 
does not require power. 


###Hosman
My name is Laura Hosman, 
I am assistant professor at Arizona State University 
and the school for the future of innovation and society 
and at the Polytechnic School. 


I launched Solar Spell 
to bring educational content to places 
around the globe that don’t have 
electricity, internet, libraries 
or access to valuable educational information.
Having access to information means 
being able to make more empowering decisions 
about one's life.


Libraries are also traditionally a place of community.
I also believe that we can 
build community with a digital library. 
That's one of the reasons 
that we started working at schools.


###Hakim
I anticipate that Solar Spell would reach 
to all these populations in across Africa. 
Solar Spell Health, Solar Spell education, 
I'm anticipating having all the Solar Spell 
libraries across Africa in remote areas, particularly.


The moment you come to 
the demonstration on the Solar Spell 
and how it works,
and how you can access the books, 
you can even see the faces 
and the smiles you see on the people. 
It’s because they know that this 
is what we have been waiting for. 
To them, they know 
this is what we have been waiting for, 
we want to have it. 


###Ross
I'm Dr. Heather Ross. 
I'm a professor of nursing at Arizona State University. 
I teach things like health equity 
and social justice 
and global health policy. 


We are in Malawi, in Blantyre.
We're here because 
our Solar Spell Health Library 
is going out into the field 
for the first time.
 
The Kamuzu University of Health Sciences 
has partnered with the Peace Corps 
and with Solar Spell 
to be our very first pilot 
of the Solar Spell Health Library in Africa.
 
So what's in the library? 
All kinds of reference materials. 
We have a medical encyclopedia, 
we have textbooks.
We have all kinds of videos
for healthcare professionals, 
but also for people in the community.
 
And of course, 
we can't say it enough, 
a library is never done. 
So it's always growing.


###Patrick
Nursing school is really, really, needed 
here in Malawi 
as far as health issues are concerned.  
We have so many hospitals around Malawi, 
but then the health workers are just very few,
we have a number of diseases 
that people do suffer here in Malawi. 
So for them to get better, 
for them to get treated, 
we need a huge task force 
that will be there each and every time 
to give you support 
and to give treatment to those patients.


My name is Patrick Somanje, 
I’m the president for student representative council. 
I’m doing Bachelors of Science in nursing and Midwifery.
…..
Most of the challenges here 
for students are financial issues. 
I understand each and every student is 
supposed to buy his or her own meals daily, 
so it becomes a challenge for most of the students. 
As a result, most of the students do not take meals, 
maybe 3 to 4 days, 
maybe they just take tea 
in the morning and then off they go.


In terms of having learning resources, 
it has become hard, 
because for a student to buy a laptop, 
it’s not easy.


And then our library is full of old books.
The coming of this Solar Spell, 
it exactly will answer to some of the problems 
that students have, 
because they’ll be able to get information, 
they'll be able to have any sort of books 
that they need through this Solar Spell library. 


These academic issues are dynamics. 
They do changes it every day. 
So it means that Solar Spell needs to be 
updated time and again, 
so I just want you to devise the ways 
on how this will be timely updated


###Chrissy/Love
Chrissy: 
My name is Chrissy Zamaleh, 
I’m a year three student studying 
Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Midwifery 
at school of nursing, KUHeS. 
Love: 
My name is Love Halowah, 
I’m a third year student from Zomba, Malawi.


Love: 
Sometimes you may wish to study more 
but when you go to the library, 
you may find that the things 
that you’re looking for 
are not there. 
The books are not there. 
So it’s something like you’ve 
got a limited for knowledge, 
because there is no text book 
and you can start failing. 


Chrissy: 
As nurses here,
we’re told that we are educators.
If you take the Solar Spell there 
and you connect the Wi-Fi 
and put your laptop there 
and show them some videos,
for example, 
ways for reducing the risk of contracting cholera, 
like washing hands, 
if you just say it, 
they don’t know how to do it, 
it would be more challenging for them. 
But if you show them video, 
it would be more easy for them 
to grasp what you’re saying.


Love:  
If the Solar Spell would be 
implemented in the classroom, 
that means if the teacher asks the question, 
it would be easier for us to access the information, 
since there’s that search on Solar Spell. 
We’ll be answering the questions. 
We’ll be stars. 


###Ross
Listen, 
if you believe that access to information is a human right, 
then every aorta, 
every molecule of Solar Spell and the Solar Spell mission, 
is promoting justice with access to information 
and promoting equity, 
human equity and health equity
when we get information and the knowledge 
and the skills to critically assess that information 
and put it into action, 
that is power. 


And that power is for everybody. 
Across education, 
across health, 
across agriculture, 
every time we can build the information literacy 
for one person, 
we’re building power 
and that is the power that's going to fuel the future.


###Hosman
I guess that I could bring it back 
to the wonder of being a child 
and going into a library 
and knowing I could pick any of these books 
eight at a time or ten at a time 
and bring them home 
and read them 
and go to all these different worlds.


So there is a very similar feeling 
when we were giving a training 
The trainees connect to the library 
for the very first time 
and they see this world of information 
that has been curated specially for them


The one universal seemed 
to be the desire for access to more information.


***Mapitso
My name is ‘Mapitso Lepheana.


The school I teach at is Seroeng Primary School. 
It is in the district of Maseru,
between Roma and Ramabanta. 
It is the school that is found in the mountains 
of Lesotho especially Thabana-li-‘mele. 


Our beautiful school that is 
found in the mountain areas of Lesotho. 




I teach Grade 4.


Here in Lesotho, 
we need Science Labs and Computer Labs 
to improve on students’ education 
and knowledge they need to have. 
We could be happy if the Lesotho government 
could furnish schools with Science and Computer Labs.


Well, the Lesotho Education s
ystem is not enough. 
It needs a lot of things. 
For example, 
teaching aids are not there in classrooms, 
so students get only a certain portion 
as they learn about things they cannot see or touch. 
Science Labs and Computer Labs 
can help both teachers’ teaching 
and students’ learning to become easy, 
and that can improve the Lesotho Education system 
only if the Ministry of Education 
can provide schools with teaching aids 
and learning aids.


I wish students, 
especially the ones that I teach 
could take entrepreneurship 
as their career to sharpen their knowledge 
and skills so that they 
could earn their living. 
This would help them become self-employed 
as there is so much lack 
of employment in Lesotho.


Help us with life skills 
and positive changes that could 
develop the lives of community that lives here.


***Rethabile
Students of this years have more experience 
and more knowledge than us 
because they are exposed to technology 
at an early stage, 
and thus make them even 
more prellient than us. 
Nowadays students use phones at school 
while teaching and learning takes place, 
hence why they have access to technology 
and new things around the world. 
They also use the internet which helps them 
gain more knowledge about things around them 
and around the world.


###Bo Abuti 1
Student 1: 
Before Solar Spell, 
I would get my information on Google or YouTube.


Student 1: 
In the Solar Spell, 
you can find any topic that you like; 
Art, Education tools, Health and Safety, 
Digital Literacy, 
Language and reading, 
Local Resources, 
Math, Science, Social science,
sustainability.


Student 2: 
So, when you want to know about rocks, 
you go to science.


Student 1: You go to science, 
after science, you go to the earth, 
look for which topic you are looking for, 
any topic, three types of rocks.


Student 1: 
I think the Solar Spell 
helps a lot of people, 
even if you still want to learn things 
that your teacher has not taught you, 
that you are still curious about, 
you can look it on the Solar Spell and find out.


Student 2: 
It changed that, 
people can know things that no one can know, 
so if the teacher before ask you that question, 
you must know it, 
and the Solar Spell will help you.


Student 1: 
The first time I used the Solar Spell, 
I went to the science and looked two types of brains. 
I learnt that, your brains has two types, 
the survival brain and I forgotten the other part. 


Student 1: 
A Doctor. 
I want to be a doctor 
because helping people is what I like to do.


Student 2: 
I want to be a police. 
To stop crimes. 
Being a police you can do justice in your city, 
when people steal in your city, 
if you are police you can stop them and that is justice.


Student 1: In the Solar Spell, 
if I know about more, 
about the part of the human body 
and how they work, 
and you do get diseases, 
I would be a doctor. 


Student 2: 
I can see how police can catch people. 
So, if I catch people, 
I must copy and must remember 
what the Solar Spell taught me 
about what to do.


Student 1: 
I want to explore more,
 so I want to be a doctor.
Student 1: 
We share one textbook.
Each table gets one textbook.


Student 2: 
The textbooks are so small. 
They will not do us all.


Student 1: 
If we were given, 
some people will copy. 
So, that’s why.  
If each one had their own textbook, 
some people will not try to 
look into some people book.


Student 1: 
I like learning 
because I have so many questions 
about the earth, 
that’s why I like to learn, 
to know the answer. 
I will tell the world that everybody 
should learn more about humans, 
the earth 
and the parts of the brains and how they work, 
so people can be doctors. 
If they were more doctors- 
Nowadays, I see more soldiers and more policemen, 
no doctors.
 If there were no doctors, 
if we were ill, 
who will find a cure?




###Lehlokonolo
My name is Lehlohonolo and I’m in grade seven.
My favorite subject is science.
I think I want to be a Doctor.


I have learned that using Solar Spell, 
you can find many items that you want. 
So, if you have homework 
and you can look with the Solar Spell 
and you’d find it.


It will change the quality of my 
education because sometimes,
 if I have homework that my parents don’t know it, 
I don’t do it, 
but this time I can check in the Solar Spell.


I’m excited about high school.
I look to more on having some friends.


You press here, 
and do whatever you want to search, 
you press.
If you want to know about Science,
 you can press here, 
and lessons, 
because whenever you want to search-
This is Art, Educational tools, Health Safety, Digital literacy,
 Language and Reading, Local Resources, 
Math, Science, Social Studies, Sustainability, 
Community Health, Chain Academy.
Solar Spell makes finding resources 
easier for me.


School is important 
because if you attend school, 
you can reach your dreams easier. 
Sometimes, like there’s no food here at school, 
and my mother doesn’t have 
any money to buy food.
Two people share one textbook, 
but don’t stay with it.
There are times that I could wish 
I could take the textbook home.


A computer lab would be so important because, 
if madam is asking us something, 
and we don’t know it, 
and it's not in the Solar Spell, 
we can go to the computer
and look for it. 
Our school only has 
one tablet to use Solar Spell on.
If we had more tablets, 
more students could be 
able to use the library.
It will make a lot of difference 
because everyone could 
search everything that they want.
I want to thank us 
because now I am learning more on the Solar spell.


###Palesa
My name is Palesa Betty. 
I’m in grade seven.


When I use Solar Spell, 
I get on my library using my phone.
Our school has textbooks 
but we can’t bring them home.
My favorite subject is Maths, 
and I want to learn more about Maths 
when I go to high school.
The singing makes me feel happy.
When I was young,
I’d always sing. 
I don’t know why. 
I like to sing.
And it’s because 
I know how to sing. 


I want to tell the world that 
we have to take care of ourselves 
and we have to love others a
nd help each other. 
That’s all.


###Moselantja
 I wish Solar Spell has more content 
about Lesotho’s cultures.
I want to tell the world that 
education is important.
It’s important because when we’ve learnt 
our lives are going to be 
better than the one who didn’t learn, 
even though I don’t have much, 
education that will help me 
to succeed in the world.


***Moselantja
My grandma always says “bocha ke palesa”
I’ve been thinking more about what that means,
And I remembered that I don’t often see flowers growing alone
They blossom together, where the sun is strong, and the soil is rich


Next year, my friends and I are all going to different schools
Some are going off to the capital city 
Where the schools have more textbooks,
and more opportunity.


But I’ll be here, walking to a school nearby
So I can take care of my family.
I hope that my school 
will have the books and teachers I need 
to create the future I dream of
so I can help others to live in peace.
