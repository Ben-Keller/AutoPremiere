In schools, there are not enough textbooks, so this is the right time to have this success to the educative resources.

It doesnï¿½t make any meaning, so it wonï¿½t be good if you can- This is the right time for us to share what we have, the technology that we have wish does not require internet, does not require power. You have to use the nature of sun that we have to power the device, so that they can be able to access the library. So we engaged eight facilitators, we trained them at the Juba girls training center and then we send them out to communities, to locations where parents would come and download the textbooks and then they go and use them in the house for learning.

So, why do you thing Solar Spell is specifically valuable in the nursing Space. Hakim: Yeah, basically and sincerely speaking, I donï¿½t have a health background, but as someone who leaves in South Sudan and as seen the situation, and I have kids, and I have family that needs health services, I do believe that the issues of health information is lacking.

Itï¿½s a big thing as well but I do believe that as technology is evolving and as devices are coming and the country is developing, majority of people are starting to get resources and devices especially in urban areas.

And when you have something, if you have food and you talk about what do I eat food with? You canï¿½t wait for what to eat food with when youï¿½re hungry. You can eat the food right now, and then something to eat with will follow. So, whatever is available to be use to access the resources will always be there. The most important thing is availability of the information that we need to have to be able to have the practitioners to be able to remind themselves about the information they have forgotten. When you have the library around you, you browse what you want, you even remind yourself what you have learnt, though you donï¿½t have the physical textbook, but you have the textbook and the information offline through the library.\n",
