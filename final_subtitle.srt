1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:12,375
What I would like to do with Moselantja

2
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:20,666
is for us to live in peace

3
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:36,666
Peace means peaceful life within the family

4
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:46,750
Let us be people who live well in peace

5
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,416
My name is Matsele Selikane

6
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:50,625
I live at Ha Masupeli with my two grandchildren

7
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:54,625
Thabiso and Moselantja

8
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:58,41
Libraries are also traditionally a place of community

9
00:00:58,41 --> 00:00:59,958
I also believe that we can

10
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:02,750
build community with a digital library

11
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,125
Thats one of the reasons

12
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,83
that we started working at schools

13
00:01:06,83 --> 00:01:08,666
I anticipate that Solar Spell would reach

14
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,250
to all these populations in across Africa

15
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,750
Solar Spell Health Solar Spell education

16
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,958
Im anticipating having all the Solar Spell

17
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:18,708
libraries across Africa in remote areas particularly

18
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,583
The moment you come to

19
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:23,708
the demonstration on the Solar Spell

20
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,125
and how it works

21
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,875
and how you can access the books

22
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,166
you can even see the faces

23
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:33,291
and the smiles you see on the people

24
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:33,500
Its because they know that this

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,958
is what we have been waiting for

26
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,791
To them they know

27
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:42,791
this is what we have been waiting for

28
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,750
we want to have it
