1
00:00,000 --> 00:02,000
Where are you from Neko?

2
00:03,000 --> 00:06,000
I am from a territory called Akualü

3
00:07,000 --> 00:10,000
Although the elders call it Manaure

4
00:11,000 --> 00:16,000
Ah, you come from the Wild West and now you are here.

5
00:18,000 --> 00:21,000
In Nazareth or corregimiento de Nazareth as they call it

6
00:22,000 --> 00:30,000
We are in the territory of Usijou´, in Alewalü.
I don't know if you've heard that it's a sacred place.

7
00:31,000 --> 00:36,000
Yes, it is the only one with some characteristics
different natural

8
00:39,000 --> 00:45,000
Yes of course. My grandmother and my mother's grandmother were from here.

9
00:47,000 --> 00:51,000
Where is the sea? yes, over there, from here you can see the sea

10
00:52,000 --> 00:56,000
Yes it's true.
yes they lived here

11
00:57,000 --> 01:01,000
But the sea is far from here? Yes, you are far.

12
01:02,000 --> 01:09,000
They said they moved, they had left their
things as you can see

13
01:10,000 --> 01:18,000
There where the pieces of amuchi (ceramic) are,
are their ancestral remains (bone)

14
01:19,000 --> 01:27,000
They decided to go to the seashore because
They say that they were already bored here.

15
01:28,000 --> 01:33,000
So they left, but they came back again. Yeah. right here

16
01:35,000 --> 01:42,000
This was what you were talking about, right? Yeah.
I can touch it? No. It is forbidden

17
01:43,000 --> 01:49,000
You can't touch it, you can only see it. if you touch it
you can get sick

18
01:51,000 --> 01:58,000
When you touch it you take the energies of the dead
that can cause you harm

19
02:00,000 --> 02:02,000
Same with your arrival here

20
02:03,000 --> 02:09,000
TRUE. You must harmonize with the territory because we
surround the souls of those who lived here

21
02:10,000 --> 02:18,000
This belongs to them right? Yes, that's why their souls
they are here because those are their belongings

22
02:21,000 --> 02:28,000
This was their territory and they said that no one can.
take part of this sand

23
02:29,000 --> 02:36,000
Then we Pausayu arrived to inhabit it

24
02:37,000 --> 02:40,000
I understand. And what did they bring from the sea?

25
02:41,000 --> 02:46,000
The sand, they threw it here so that it would stay that way.

26
02:47,000 --> 02:53,000
That is to say, they brought the sand from the beach in
this piece of desert

27
02:56,000 --> 03:03,000
The old say that through a dream they were told
to bring the sand from there

28
03:04,000 --> 03:07,000
I'm telling you so you can say it, this part
then they cut it

29
03:08,000 --> 03:12,000
Guille said that in the dream they were told
the next

30
03:13,000 --> 03:18,000
That, if they loved this land so much, it could bring the
earth to here

31
03:19,000 --> 03:26,000
and that they did. This is how this place originates

32
03:27,000 --> 03:34,000
You could say that. that started from a dream
and so on

33
03:39,000 --> 03:48,000
So they brought him here, right? Yeah.
They brought it little by little until it spread

34
03:49,000 --> 03:58,000
As you can see this before this was small, but after
they were expanding it up there

35
03:59,000 --> 04:05,000
Yes, now I understand. How nice to know the story
behind this

36
04:06,000 --> 04:10,000
Yes of course, in fact, all this that is here
it is also beautiful

37
04:13,000 --> 04:21,000
Yeah. It is very good to make known what
We have it because it is part of our Wayuu culture.

38
04:22,000 --> 04:29,000
You already know that in La Guajira there is this place, Alewalü
will be recognized by the world

39
04:30,000 --> 04:37,000
Through stories like these they will know not only
the place but its spirituality

40
04:38,000 --> 04:45,000
Since there are also many jewels of
the deceased

41
04:46,000 --> 04:52,000
That is why it is a sacred place because here are the
things of those who created it

42
04:55,000 --> 05:03,000
People say that here in the north is where
are the most sacred places

43
05:04,000 --> 05:07,000
And that is why it is important to make them known. Yes of course.

44
05:08,000 --> 05:15,000
Well, thank you very much for what you shared with us.
Thank you anyway for coming

45
05:16,000 --> 05:20,000
For coming from so far to know our territory.

46
05:22,000 --> 05:29,000
After winter it doesn't bloom here? No,
Does it stay like this? Yes of course, it gets wet and that's it

47
05:30,000 --> 05:38,000
the animals walk and do not get their feet wet.
You see there is no grass. No.

48
05:39,000 --> 05:45,000
And if it rains a lot? It may rain a lot but still.
it does not bloom because it is a sacred place

49
05:46,000 --> 05:47,000
the territory is sacred

50
05:48,000 --> 05:55,000
That was destined. Yes, that's why they were created
ancestors who saw here

51
05:56,000 --> 06:02,000
The people who come to Nazareth say that their
ancestors son of here too

52
06:03,000 --> 06:11,000
Those from Dusakawi (health association) said that their
grandmothers told them that they have ancestors here

53
06:14,000 --> 06:22,000
They say they will come back here again.
Yes, that's OK

54
06:23,000 --> 06:31,000
It seems good to me that they come again so that
know more, we make them climb the mountains

55
06:32,000 --> 06:39,000
Yes, we have to arrive earlier, look how they are rushing us. Yes, it is true, it is complex.

56
06:40,000 --> 06:47,000
Because it is already getting dark and we already have
to leave because of how sacred it is

57
06:48,000 --> 06:50,000
You are in Alewalü in the Alewalü Dunes

58
06:51,000 --> 06:54,000
Smile smile. Stretch your hands.
